00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,080
In this video you're going to learn how to art a YouTube card to video and having a car just like this

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,590
that links back to your Web site is a great way to convert leads and generate sales from your youtube

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:22,050
videos and you can also use these cards to add links to Youtube playlists or other videos or even prompt

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,310
viewers to make a donation.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:33,620
So they are a fantastic way for you to really get your viewer to take action and engage with your videos.

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,920
No to add cards to your youtube videos you first most need to upload the videos so we add these cards

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,310
afterwards.

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,780
So in order to access videos that you've uploaded you want to come into each channel click on the icon

9
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:56,280
in the top right hand corner then come down into the Creator's studio and click then into your video

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,990
manager here in the video manager you're going to see even videos that you may have shed Ewold so it

11
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,980
can be a good idea to shed all your videos until you've added the card.

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,160
If that is something that you've mentioned in the video like check out the video linked above etc. so

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,990
to the Cards find the video first and then click on edit then you can see that there are a number of

14
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,820
tabs across the top here.

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,830
We want to come across to the card section and then we really want to start by deciding where we're

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,440
going on this card.

17
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,990
Now if you were linking off to another video you may have mentioned that in your video and said If you

18
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,280
want to learn more about that check out this video and it'll be linked above or you may just at the

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,480
start of the video encourage people to check at your Web site so we can move this bar to really set

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,060
the time that we want the card to appear and you can add multiple cards if you want.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,520
But in this example I'm just going to add a card that pops up after four seconds.

22
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:13,300
And the card here is a link to my website now to enable a link to your Web site.

23
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,560
You do need to have associated your Web site to your YouTube channel.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,110
And if you don't then it's going to appear appear if you haven't done that you can just click through

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,670
and you're going to see the option in settings here to that associate a Web site and it'll walk you

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,950
through all the steps to really do that and have that success and green lines show up.

27
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,100
So if you do want to link back to the Web site you can go ahead and do that.

28
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,200
If not you can use one of the options here to link to channel.

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,070
If you just want to practice this song and link to web site insert the Web site and click next.

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,420
Now we have to put in the card title the call to action and the teaser text.

31
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,700
So if we go back to this example it's already done.

32
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,480
We can see that this is the title.

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,500
This is the call to action.

34
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,420
And in fact the teaser text to show you what that looks like.

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,020
This should pop by after a couple of seconds up here like that.

36
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:24,500
So this is something you want to get somebody who's attention so it's fun and some that want to learn

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,100
more.

38
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:36,070
And the call to action we can just put in like something like that

39
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,500
to create the card then just go ahead and click create this image will be pulled from the Web site.

40
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,660
But you can change the image if you want to use a specific one for the card.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,950
So I'm going to go ahead and click and create the card.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,570
Now if we play the video we can see it right here in the video manager.

43
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,640
It appears maybe move it back to the start

44
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,190
and there we go and says want to learn more.

45
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,100
Now if we click this open it is a link back to my Web site and that will help generate leads and sales

46
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,300
from my YouTube videos.

47
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,680
So now it's your turn to come into your video manager and across to the tab for cards.

48
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:33,410
An ATM card to your Web site or a channel or to promote a video or play list that you have created.
