1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,860
In this video you're going to learn how to create a video views Kostin audience.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,400
Another extremely valuable customer audience.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,630
You can create and the great news is you don't need to have Web site an email list or even a lot of

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,440
engagements on your Facebook page to create this.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,770
So what we're really talking about here is on your Facebook page if you have created videos you can

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,750
create a custom audience for people who have watched those videos.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,490
So for example here we are on my Facebook page.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,170
I have two videos here and you can see that I've got fifteen hundred views on one.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,070
I read 600 views on another and what I want to do is really create an audience for those people who

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,310
have watched those videos and I could then target or not with another video for them or even follow

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:57,990
up with a related opt in to an email list or a product that was related to what I talked about in the

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,190
video creating a video of us custom audience is very very simple.

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:09,090
We just need to come once again into your Facebook Ads manager and into your audience's tab.

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,560
Once inside then you just click on Create audience here in the top left hand corner select custom audience

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,920
you want to come down and select engagements on Facebook and the type of engagement you want to use

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,900
to create this audience is going to be the video option here.

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:34,140
Now once inside you have the option to set the parameters for this custom audience how broad or narrow

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,970
do you want to be.

19
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,010
And the first variable here is how much of the video people watched.

20
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,280
So you can see here that people who watch at least three seconds of the video people who were viewed

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,140
are at least 10 seconds 25 percent etc. all the way to the end.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,420
And obviously as you go and if for example you selected people who watch Ninety five percent of your

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,200
video.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,540
Those people are going to be extremely interested in maybe your follow up campaign but it's going to

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,620
be a much much smaller audience.

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,760
And for example to give you a breakdown of some numbers for my video that I used to set up this custom

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,120
audience 1300 views when I selected to create a custom audience for people who'd watch at least three

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,690
seconds that was.

29
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,470
Twelve hundred people so almost everybody who watched the video would be included.

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,380
When I bump this up to ten seconds the custom audience was just 500 people so a third of the total amount

31
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,630
of views that I got in the video.

32
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,580
So as you can see the numbers drop pretty dramatically based on the setting that you take.

33
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,500
For now let's just select three seconds so we can include as many people as possible.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,190
Next up.

35
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,360
Then you choose the video or videos that you want to include in this custom audience.

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,270
I've got two videos here on my Facebook page.

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,450
They're not really related to each other in terms of the topics.

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,790
So right now I'm just going to select one and one video here.

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,170
Now if I wanted to just show somebody another video in and it out to drive video views then I could

40
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,470
maybe select both of these because I know those people watch videos.

41
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,920
And so if I have another videos views and there's a good chance they're going to watch that.

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,800
However if I wanted to create a custom audience where I was following or put an opt in or product related

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,090
to this video it's probably better just to pick one video and keep it on topic.

44
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,250
Or if you've a number of different videos related to that same topic then select those.

45
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,900
You've selected your video.

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,920
Go ahead and click confirm.

47
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,000
You also the option to set the time parameters for this custom audience.

48
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,400
And you could set this to people who have watch videos in the last month.

49
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,290
I'm just going to leave it at 3 6 5 to include as many people as possible.

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,610
Then you want to give your audience name as usual.

51
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:06,620
So we're going to put in video views custom audience 365 days.

52
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,530
I'm already going set up some misspelling going to put in number two here so I can tell them apart.

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,270
Then you click Create audience and remember once again that it will take up to 30 minutes for your audience

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
to be ready to use.

55
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,190
You can click next.

56
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,390
And then you have the option to create an ad or expand your audience using a look alike audience.

57
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,490
So I'm going to click on there now as you can see this is populating that message might switch to your

58
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:39,450
audience is too small but just leave it a full half an hour that will change and you can see the audiences

59
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,120
that I've set up already here.

60
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,300
We have people who watch 10 seconds.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,970
That was 500 people.

62
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,560
So a smaller number.

63
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,460
And then people who just watched 3 seconds of video a much bigger number 3300 people.

64
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,270
Now you might be wondering OK well I have no views on my videos right now.

65
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,790
If I publish a view to my page of get five or 10 views.

66
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,180
Well here is the workaround for you.

67
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,160
First thing you need to do is create a video and upload it to your Facebook page.

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,830
Then what you could do is to create a video views campaigns to come into your ads create to select your

69
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,770
marketing objective for video views.

70
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:30,170
Then you can go down and in the format and media here just select your video as the video for the campaign

71
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,570
on the back of that when you've got maybe a thousand views in that video or through your paid advertisement.

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,090
You could create custom audience from those video views.

73
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,910
And then once you have that custom audience you could use it maybe to follow up with an opt in to an

74
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,850
email list or product or whatever the next step in your marketing funnel is.

75
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,860
So that is how you could build up a video of views custom audience from scratch from literally having

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:06,340
no Facebook fans custom web site audience email Esther anything you can really start with a video.

77
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,140
Push that video in and build a custom audience on the back of it.

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,770
And then follow up with the next advertisement for an opt in.

79
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,550
Cetera.

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,910
So now they know how to set up a video views custom audience.

81
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,780
Go ahead and set one up for yourself.

82
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,460
Following the steps that you've learned in this video.
