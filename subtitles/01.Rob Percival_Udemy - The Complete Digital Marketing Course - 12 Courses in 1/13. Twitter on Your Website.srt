In this video you're going to learn how to add a Twitter button to your website.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,000
And to do that the first thing you want to do is go to publish dot Twitter dot com on here you will

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,950
see all the options for what you can embed from Twitter onto your Web site.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,510
You can click to drop down here to see everything that you can embed or Personally I find it's sometimes

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,650
easier just to Braz these options and get a visual of what I can embed for this video we will be adding

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,380
a Twitter button so select on this option and you can see that there are different types of buttons

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,490
that you can share.

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,690
Been to share an article or a link follow button mentioned button hashtag button or message button.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,760
For this example I'll just take the Follow button and then you really want to add your username in here.

10
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,650
Now as you can see the advantage of outing this follow button is that it can help you grow your audience

11
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:09,250
on Twitter and it makes it easy for your website visitors to really find your profile on follow your

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,470
account without even needing to leave to leave the blog post.

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:21,340
So I'm going to hit preview here and then I get this code and what you need to do is really embed this

14
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,270
code onto your Web site so we can copy the code and then as it says here paste this code directly into

15
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,640
the to him a portion of your site and you'll be good to go if you need more instructions.

16
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,160
There are complete instructions here.

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,630
So the process is going to be slightly different for each type of web site that you have.

18
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,650
But coming into a WordPress site I'll show you how it's done.

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,420
I'm going to click say a post new post as if I was writing maybe a new blog post.

20
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,560
And then what I can do is I can come across to text.

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:11,680
This is where I paste in the DML control V and then if I come across to the visual just need to do it

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,320
again so that's in the visual Plaisted and in the text and then I'm going to see it in the visual and

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,170
once I hit publish then it's going to show up exactly like that.

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,650
So now that you know how to add a Twitter button to your Web site.

25
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,500
Come over to publish dot Twitter dot com and add any button that you want to your Web site so you can

26
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,240
really grow your Twitter got Twitter audience from your Web site.
