00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.130
In this video you're going to learn how to use YouTube analytics to grow your YouTube channel.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.180
And I'm going to walk you through the top 10 reports that you need to focus on if you want to get more

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.730
views subscribers and likes and comments on your videos.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.070
So to access your youtube analytics Firstly come up and click on your channel icon in the top right

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.090
hand corner and then go ahead and click on creators studio.

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.650
Now it's in here that you'll find your analytics reports and they are then in the left hand of the sidebar

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.450
here so you can go ahead and click on that just open everything up.

8
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.270
Now it's worth just taking a minute to explain how everything is laid out.

9
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.090
So what we are seeing here is an overview report.

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.430
You can see that there are graphical representation here of some of the YouTube reports.

11
00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.890
So these are really Overby reports and graphs of all of these reports that are listed here in the sidebar.

12
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.600
And these are the reports that we're going to be digging into to really analyze them and understand

13
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.480
them more.

14
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.240
But you can come into this overview tab just to get a quick overview of the performance of your channel.

15
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.890
It is also worth noting that by default it will be shown for the last 28 days so all of the reports

16
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.150
in analytics are just shown for the last 28 days if you do want to change that.

17
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
You can click on this drop 10 in the top right hand corner and click and look at the analytics for the

18
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.710
last 90 days say or the last 365 days.

19
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.720
So I do you think that the last 28 days is a good time frame to be analyzing and perhaps you should

20
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.140
even put a date in the calendar every month to come back and review the last 28 days maybe at the start

21
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380
of the month review the last month.

22
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.490
But you can take that longer term view if you do want to do that.

23
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.000
Now let us dive into the 10 reports that you really want to focus on in order to understand what is

24
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210
working on watch you can do to grow.

25
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.200
So the first report that we want to look at is watch time and this is a big one.

26
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.310
This is in fact the most important metric on YouTube that you want to be constantly trying to increase.

27
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.340
Now you can see here this is watch time minutes and really the explanation of this is the total number

28
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.110
of minutes of viewing of your content from your audience.

29
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.770
Now why is that so important as war and why is that really one of the top reports listed out here.

30
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.980
Well it's very simple.

31
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.180
YouTube wants to keep people watching videos on their platform as much as possible.

32
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.050
Why.

33
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.080
Because the more time people are spending watching YouTube the more ads that they can put in front of

34
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.590
them and the more ads that they can sell to advertisers and increase their revenues.

35
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.950
So recently YouTube actually changed watch time as the most important metric in determining whether

36
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.080
they promote your channel or whether they promote your videos.

37
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.290
So it's very important to try and increase the watch time on your channel in order for it to grow.

38
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.510
Now one way you can do that is to start to understand and look at this list and understand where the

39
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.760
watch time is coming from your channel.

40
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.280
Now I can see that 85 percent of percent watched time on this channel is coming from this one single

41
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.200
video.

42
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.180
So what I can do to really understand how to increase my watch time is look at the format of this video.

43
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.220
Look at the length of this video.

44
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.940
Look at the way I've structured it.

45
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.400
Topic of it and really determine could I make more videos like that to increase my watch time.

46
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.360
And that would be a very tangible way that I could grow my channel.

47
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.440
Now looking further down I can see that there are some videos that a very small watch time maybe the

48
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.210
topics are too neige maybe the videos are too short.

49
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.970
And so you really want to look at this report and do more of what is working.

50
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.350
That is the simple mantra for for an analytics person is just do more of what is working.

51
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.310
And that's what you really want to be keeping in mind what ever report you look at and analytics whether

52
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.100
it be here on YouTube on Facebook on Google Analytics.

53
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.690
Just really do more of what is working and you're going to grow your channel.

54
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.770
So that was watch time.

55
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.330
Let us now look at the second report or metric that you want to be focusing on in order to grow your

56
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.830
channel and that is traffic sources.

57
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.920
So coming then into the left side bar here we can click on traffic sources.

58
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.060
Now what we are seeing here are the sources of our traffic and you can always hover your mouse over

59
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.770
any of these keywords here or add words on the analytics reports to get a better explanation.

60
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.960
So really we can see here it's the means through which a viewer found a video.

61
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.990
Now this is extremely important to understand if you want to grow your channel because you need to know

62
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.890
how people are finding your videos for this channel.

63
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.870
I can see that 55 percent are coming through suggested videos.

64
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:23.930
So that's interesting to know that I'm appearing there in the sidebar and alongside or after other videos

65
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.840
and I can even dig down deeper into this as well to really figure out which of those videos that I'm

66
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.860
mean suggested again so I can see and even click this open here.

67
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.870
Hello.

68
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.330
Whoops sorry for that.

69
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.900
I can see that my video is showing up in the suggested videos here beside this video so maybe I could

70
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.860
create more videos that are similar to this topic or are similar to other videos that this channel has

71
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.730
made so that I can continue to be suggested next to them.

72
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.050
And let's go back and read a look at YouTube search.

73
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.470
So if we click into this report again I can have a look at some of these search terms that people are

74
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.750
actually typing in that are resulting in people watching my video.

75
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.480
So you can see a lot of them here as Hudes Torrijos tutorial for beginners.

76
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.580
Those are the key words that people are typing in to really find that top video on my channel.

77
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:28.340
So once again I could continue to make videos that really allow people to or or make more videos really

78
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.240
about those keywords that people are typing in and maybe even make them specifically by these exact

79
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.160
keywords that people are typing in.

80
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.220
So a ton of information there about how people are finding my videos and the traffic sources reports

81
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.420
and that type of actionable things that I can do and to really grow my channel.

82
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.850
All right.

83
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.840
That was number two.

84
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.410
Let us move on now to number three.

85
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.790
The audience demographics reports and this is another great one.

86
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.070
So let's come in to the left side by here.

87
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.460
Click on demographics.

88
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.200
We're going to get a ton of interesting information in this report.

89
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.810
And you can have a couple of different options here in terms of how you view these reports.

90
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:20.890
Personally for me I like the pie chart I think is just the easiest way to understand and I can see very

91
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:29.020
quickly then that 46 percent of my viewers are watching the videos are between this age bracket of 25

92
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.470
to 30 for.

93
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.440
So this is very interesting to know.

94
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.630
I want to make sure that if my ideal customer is that age bracket that they are in fact the people who

95
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:47.080
are watching most of my videos if they weren't and it was say much older demographic Well maybe I could

96
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:56.200
say hey that's interesting I could do two things one is refocus my videos back towards my ideal customers

97
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.870
or I could say hey it's pretty interesting that this age group is more interested in the topic than

98
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.800
I thought they would be.

99
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:09.430
Maybe I could create some specific videos that talk to them that address their particular needs around

100
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.700
this particular topic or product or service et cetera.

101
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.540
Now as well as age range.

102
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.320
Another very interesting thing to look at is gender.

103
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.070
So you can click across look at the gender.

104
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:27.820
And again I can see that there is a heavy skewed towards males in my audience 74 percent and that's

105
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.780
pretty spot on.

106
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.930
What I would imagine it would be that age bracket and males.

107
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.940
But again you want to just be making sure that the gender and the age munity matches up with who you

108
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.640
think your ideal customer is.

109
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.570
So the audience demographic reports huge amount of information there.

110
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.730
Again 3D.

111
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.840
Understand your audience and make sure that you're on target with your videos.

112
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.860
Now another thing that we can look at would be leaving these demographic reports and this is really

113
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.540
the fourth metric or report you want to look at is your geographical impact.

114
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.110
So it still in this demographics tab We come then to more we can click on we can click on geography

115
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:19.560
here and this is a great report because it shows us really the countries of our viewers that I can see

116
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:26.790
for example here that 31 percent are coming or viewing from the U.S. and I can even see their at their

117
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.870
mail as well which is pretty interesting for me to see.

118
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.880
My ideal customer would probably be in this country as a top one.

119
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.950
Some businesses they don't really care about where their viewers are coming from but other businesses

120
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:47.970
like local businesses or e-commerce businesses might be paying particular attention to this because

121
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.920
if you're an e-commerce business you're getting a lot of viewers from say India you don't ship products

122
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.230
there.

123
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:59.790
Well that will give you an indication OK maybe we should set it up so it's easy for people to get products

124
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:06.840
shipped there or maybe we should even think about how come we address our products or services to the

125
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:12.510
needs of those people who are viewing from that particular audience so once again once you delve further

126
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:21.620
into these geographic reports you can see a whole host of information really including even more current

127
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.370
What states in the U.S. people are viewing from.

128
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:29.440
And this is actually handy in terms of deciding what time should you post your videos.

129
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.340
You really want to post them so they're hitting that big audience.

130
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.330
So usually I try and post them actually 9:00 a.m..

131
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.920
San Francisco time.

132
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:44.550
That helps me to make sure that I'm maybe posting on a lot of my viewers are going to be online or at

133
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:51.930
least it's lunchtime or it's in the working day essentially so the geographic reports report them for

134
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.590
huge amount of information there.

135
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.140
You can use to grow your channel.

136
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:02.880
Let's move on now to the fifth report or metric that you want to focus on and that is play back locations

137
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.730
right below the demographics here can click into that.

138
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:13.920
Now this is an interesting one again and it determines and really shows you where your videos are being

139
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.060
viewed.

140
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:21.020
So I can see here again can hold a little mouse over here.

141
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:27.140
This is it shows me that 99 percent of my videos are being viewed on the YouTube's individual video

142
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.980
page on YouTube dot com or the app.

143
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.160
So that's not a big surprise for me.

144
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.000
I haven't done a lot of promotion outside of YouTube sharing videos on my web site etc. but some channels

145
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.330
might they embed their videos on their blog posts and they get a lot of views from there.

146
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:53.150
If that's the case just continue to do that if that is working for you or you could think that OK well

147
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:58.750
we're getting a lot of views from the web site but hardly any views from YouTube itself.

148
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:06.050
So we really need to optimize for that YouTube search engine as an example so playback locations it's

149
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:11.210
important to come in and understand that and make sure that it sounds that it should be or what.

150
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.730
Could you continue doing to keep growing your channel.

151
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.110
Let's move on right now to the sixth report.

152
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.600
Audience retention and it is up here in the left sidebar once again.

153
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:31.400
This is a huge one this is a really really important thing to come in and study quite a lot.

154
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:37.640
Now I can see that the average duration for my videos is six minutes and 15 seconds.

155
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:44.880
And if we scroll down here I can see which videos get the most amount of audience retention.

156
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:53.360
So I can see my top video really gets the most amount of view duration and if I click in this is where

157
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.300
it really starts to get interesting now.

158
00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:03.380
So I can see the video here and I can see actual timeline as well aware the dropoff is that is the big

159
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.220
thing.

160
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.550
I can see that after 25.

161
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:15.020
Let's say after a minute about half of the audience who started watching this video are no longer watching

162
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.100
this video and this is not unusual.

163
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:26.060
You can see it's a it's a really sharp drop off which is hard to kind of internal or you know take in

164
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.280
the first time you see to say oh my god there everybody is clicking out after less than a minute.

165
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.480
But that's not unusual.

166
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.050
A lot of people click into Web sites and they click out straight away.

167
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.490
The balance rate as it's known is usually 50 percent or higher.

168
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.470
So this is not unusual but you do want to try and reduce this as much as possible because we remember

169
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.620
the more that you retain your audience the more minutes that they are going to watch which increases

170
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.060
your watch time which will help your channel and videos rank.

171
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.970
So what are some of the strategies that you can use to retain your audience.

172
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:07.850
Well one great thing to do is to kind of do a video that is a like a list the top 10 things I know from

173
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.940
watching videos myself.

174
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:15.860
I want to see what number 10 was or I wanted to make sure I tick off snow with 789 was etc..

175
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.970
So I'm doing a kind of A-list video like that the top 10.

176
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.140
They did extremely well.

177
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.760
They got a lot of attention because people want to follow through and watch all the way to the end.

178
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.940
Another thing that you can do as well is laughter seeing this and more entertainment style videos on

179
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:38.210
YouTube people show a clip of something exciting That's coming up later on in the video.

180
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.910
And that encourages people to retain and keep watching.

181
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:50.430
Another great strategy as well as if you're doing some type of design video is to show the design to

182
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.230
the stars and say By the end of this video you will have created this design and then get into it.

183
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.980
And that really hooks them in.

184
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:06.110
So you're looking for that hook and it is important to really have a look at which videos are retaining

185
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.310
your or which videos retaining your audience.

186
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.380
Now something to note actually I just did this by accident.

187
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.390
But once you select a video it will automatically show you every single report.

188
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:25.550
So if you can see now that this retention report is just showing for this particular video if I want

189
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:33.080
to see it again across all the videos I can just D-cell like that and then I'll see it for my channel

190
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.110
again.

191
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:40.000
Let's move on though and move on to the seventh report to look at in order to grow your YouTube channel

192
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.280
and that is subscribers.

193
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.080
Subscribers is down here in the left side.

194
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:53.840
Once again I can see that over the last 28 days I've gained 262 subscribers and lost 35 subscribers

195
00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.080
so not a lot of growth there happening on the channel I can see where the subscriptions are happening

196
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.680
on the watch page that's on the page that people are watching the videos on.

197
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.340
And really what I could do by looking at these analytics now is maybe encourage people more in my videos

198
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.350
to subscribe.

199
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:22.400
I could say at the end of a video that call to action to subscribe so you can be notified when the next

200
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:29.150
helpful video comes out just even reminding people some scribe can really help gain or increase your

201
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.890
subscribers fast and rumor.

202
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.630
Why do you want subscribers.

203
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:38.090
Because subscribers watch more of your videos the normal viewers so they increase that watch time.

204
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.990
They also get notified when you put a video out.

205
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:48.110
So that helps build up those initial views and watch time that YouTube then picks up on and might start

206
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.000
promoting your video.

207
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.670
And essentially they have take shown an interest in your channeling product to your service and really

208
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.870
raise their hand and say I'm interested.

209
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:04.340
Really I'm a potential customer because they've subscribed to your channel so you do always want to

210
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:11.120
be growing your subscribers and they probably notice a lot of you Cheevers channels talking about that

211
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.670
because it is such an important metric and a sign to you that your child is interesting engaging and

212
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.260
that they should help promote.

213
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.870
OK so let's move on to the 8th report that we want to look at.

214
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.350
We're getting towards the end now and that is social shares.

215
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:36.630
So if we come down to sharing here we can really see a report here of the number of shares that our

216
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:42.890
channel or videos have gotten total over the last 28 days so I can see here it's 152.

217
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.700
And again for this particular channel this is something that I could probably improve on.

218
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.980
I can see that the top video once again is getting most of the shares 80 percent.

219
00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:01.260
But if it come down into sharing service I can really see where these shares are happening and actually

220
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:07.440
copy to clipboard here interestingly enough is is how most people are sharing my video.

221
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.270
So they're actually copying the link most likely on a phone and then pasting it into Watts up or setting

222
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.510
up a message and telling other people to check it out.

223
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:21.250
That's actually pretty interesting for me to see that a lot of people are sharing via mobile.

224
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.170
Now what that could tell me is maybe I should encourage people in my videos to do that.

225
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:32.700
I could say hey you know share this video with your friends who watz up or on your phone.

226
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:41.370
I could even myself share my videos more at across the social media like Facebook or Twitter which I

227
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.920
haven't been doing.

228
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.890
And so that could help me get more watch time subscribers that way.

229
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.980
So as well as encouraging my audience to share this report and tell me that I need to share more of

230
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.660
my videos as well and moving on to number nine.

231
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:03.540
We're almost at the end now and the next report you look out to grow your channel is comments so right

232
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.540
above here.

233
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.410
Let's have a look at the comments.

234
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:14.700
Now we can see that there has been 31 comments over the last 28 days across these videos and again this

235
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.040
is just like subscribers.

236
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.510
It really shows that people are engaging with your channel.

237
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.370
If people are engaging with your channel or they're even commenting on your channel they're more likely

238
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.710
to become subscribers.

239
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.860
They're more likely to become subscribers and more likely to become customers so it's kind of one rung

240
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.250
down on that engagement's factor.

241
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:43.190
Another cool thing about Commines is that once people Commins on your video open this up maybe you can

242
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:52.490
you can come to YouTube to show you guys are one cool thing about cons is if people come below you can

243
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.150
actually get a good look at their profile.

244
00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.850
For example here so I can see people's names who they kind of are what they look like.

245
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:08.070
If I click in to them I can see what videos they've like what subscriptions that they have.

246
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:13.850
So this gives me a great insight into who my audience is rather than just looking at the numbers and

247
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:19.190
the demographics which can be a bit hard to visualize Sometimes the comments are a great way just to

248
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.130
get a clear picture of who your audience are.

249
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.280
So that's why you can also encourage people to comment below.

250
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.860
Tell us what their favorite part of the video was.

251
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.310
Did they have any questions that they want you to to answer in a future video.

252
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:41.000
It's a great way just to increase those comments to get a better insight into who your audience are

253
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.150
and what they want and also to give that engagement signal to YouTube.

254
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:52.690
Now let's look at the final report that you can look out in order to grow your YouTube channel.

255
00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.250
And that is the likes and dislikes.

256
00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:03.000
So coming up here again we can look at this and very similar to comments and sharing subscribers.

257
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:10.730
This is just a great signal that you can send to YouTube that your videos are engaging and you can encourage

258
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.230
your audience to do that as well.

259
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:18.770
You can say that you know like the video below or a thumbs up if you like the video and found it helpful.

260
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:24.370
And you can see and measure that and really look at which of the videos are performing the best.

261
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.910
Now you can have a look at maybe your top video and say OK did I ask people to like and that is that

262
00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:34.160
why it's getting so much likes or is it just because it's the most viewed you could publish a new video

263
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:39.740
and include that call to action to like the video and ultimately see did that work.

264
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:45.200
How many lives did that actually get versus a video where you put no lights at all.

265
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:53.300
And in fact if you wanted to try and sum up all of these especially likes Commins subscribers and sharing

266
00:21:53.810 --> 00:22:00.830
a great kind of call to action phrase that you can use at the end of a video is something like this.

267
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.100
You know if you like the video please give it a thumbs up.

268
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.980
Comment below if you've any questions or any suggestions for future videos.

269
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.920
Subscribe so you get notified when the next helpful video is out.

270
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.170
Feel free to share this video with any of your friends if you think it will be helpful.

271
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:22.520
So you can see that you can include a lot of calls of actions that are really at the end of every video

272
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.350
to help drive all of these metrics.

273
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:32.630
Show YouTube that your channel has been engaged that will help then your video to be promoted in the

274
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.810
search engine and suggestive videos ready to grow your channel.

275
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.870
So now it's your turn.

276
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:45.260
Come into the creators studio and analyze these ten reports for yourself so you can get great ideas

277
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.130
and insights about how to grow your YouTube channel.
