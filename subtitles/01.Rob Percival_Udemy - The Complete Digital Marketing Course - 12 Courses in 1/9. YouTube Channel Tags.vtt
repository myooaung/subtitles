00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.290
Adding tags to your YouTube channel it will help you get more views by telling Google watch your youtube

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.590
channel is about you'll have a much better chance of appearing in the search results or in those suggestive

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.320
videos.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.980
By default your YouTube channel will have no tags.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.280
So you do need to add them manually to do that.

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.390
You want to come up and click on your channel icon and then come down into Creator studio.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.190
Once inside come down to the left hand side bar and click on channel and then come down into the advanced

8
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.460
section.

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.910
It's in here that you want to add in your channel key words and you really want to make them relevant

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.100
to the videos that you are putting at.

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.720
For example if I had a channel by cooking I could put in things like cooking recipe meals each key word

12
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.990
that you put in you want to separate by a comma.

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.140
Nothing needs to be capitalized and a great tip is that there's no limit to the amount of keywords or

14
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.630
tags that you put in.

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.340
So you can just put in as many as you think that are relevant.

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.380
Once you don't you just want to come down and click on Save.

17
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.210
So that action has been saved.

18
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.190
Now it's your turn.

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.170
Come into the creators studio and the advance section under your channel and those tags to your channel

20
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990
so you can get more views.
