1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,780
Would you like to save yourself a huge amount of time money and frustration and guarantee the success

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,810
of your marketing efforts.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,030
Wolins training I'm going to show you exactly how to do that.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,520
You're going to learn a simple process to gather a list of products and services people desperately

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,720
need and will pay money for.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,500
Same process will able to collect powerful sales copy to use on your sales pages Facebook Ads emails

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,820
and other marketing materials on the same simple process will help you to build an email list of people

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,230
to sell to even before you have a product or have ever written a blog post.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,830
Sounds pretty good doesn't it.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,380
Well what I'm going to be doing is showing you how to set up a market research survey for free with

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,790
Google Forms.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,090
I'm going to show you the three questions that are pretty magic questions that are going to getting

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,090
some incredible responses.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm going to show you how to distribute the survey to get their responses on how to analyze the survey.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,720
So there is nothing more powerful in marketing than intimately understanding a customers pain points

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,740
and desires.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,840
And this is what this process is going to enable you to do.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,740
It is going to save you huge amount of time because you wouldn't believe the amount of people who say

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,680
to me you know I'm disappointed in my Facebook ads didn't work and I say Well did you address any pain

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,150
points.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,210
Did you address any of their desires.

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,020
I take a look.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,340
None of that's there.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,990
And so you got to understand that is step one even before you write a blog post even before you do a

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,840
Facebook ad etc..

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,530
So I've used this market research process to develop my own products and services and you can too.

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,960
I use it for companies I've worked for and for clients.

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:57,240
And at the end of this training you will have this process as part of your toolkit to really find all

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,370
the valuable information to them.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,550
So let us get started and create that market research survey.
