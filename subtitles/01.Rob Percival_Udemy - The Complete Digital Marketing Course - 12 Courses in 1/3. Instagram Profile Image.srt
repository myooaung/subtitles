1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,390
In this video you're going to learn how to add a profile image to your Instagram account.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,190
That's going to attract your audience.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,680
So what I'd recommend you do is you click in and open up the top influencers that you have already added

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,390
to your accounts and it's in here that you can see the profile images that you or that they are using

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,900
now for this example the kinds I'm just creating an account where I'm the face of my business and I

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,690
may be a personal finance planner.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,410
So what I can see here is that because it's more of a can't where on the face my business and I've followed

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,760
these top influencers.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,620
They're all using personal profile images.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,300
And if I scanned and through these five scans personally the one that grabs my attention the most is

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,470
this one at the bottom.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,230
Dave Ramsey here and I think he's done a couple of things particularly well in this photo which I wanted

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,760
to point out because these are best practices that you should use for yourself.

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,810
So the first thing is that here he has got a very clear background it's a bright color.

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,320
So it really does.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,960
His face really pops off the page.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,040
Also the picture is very close in terms of it's cropped quite close.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,840
So we really get a good picture of his face.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,190
He's also I think dressed in an inappropriate way that's going to appeal to his audience.

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,930
So if we read his bio here it says America's trusted voice on money solvency trust is a very important

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,650
being an authority.

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,600
And you can see he's wearing a suit and a shirt and he's got passes on.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,820
So he looks smart.

24
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:47,030
He's kind of an older guy and so this is kind of a perfect profile image which I think would really

25
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,760
attract his audience because they would see him as an authority.

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,580
And it's obviously a professional photo.

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,860
It's easy to recognize him and it kind of suits the type.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,870
He's wearing the type of thing that his audience would expect if he was in his gym clothes.

29
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,780
Well it wouldn't be obvious that we're talking about business and money.

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,760
So that is a great example of someone doing it really well let's have a look at some of these other

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,830
guys we can look at Tim Ferriss here.

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,790
Now I think personally for me you can see that he's quite a bit of a distance back from the camera he's

33
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,520
pointing to his T-shirt which I don't understand what that's about.

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,020
And it's also just hard to recognize in the background of that image is obviously him standing in maybe

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,200
a house or something like that.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,160
I don't really know what's going on there.

37
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,770
So you can see it doesn't pop off the page as much now in his profile page here.

38
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,080
It's probably still recognizable as him.

39
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:50,500
But if we go to a kind of a an individual post you can see he appears much smaller at the top of the

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,200
page.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,410
So it's much harder to recognize that as him.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,450
And so that's really the difference between the two that we've seen there.

43
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,230
Maybe he could improve that a lot by just following more similar to what Dave Ramsey is here doing here

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,780
a much closer shot of the face and maybe a clear background that really pops off.

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,280
He doesn't have to be in his seat.

46
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,150
If that's not what is really going to attract his audience and what his audience expects to see.

47
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,410
Now there's some other ones here.

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,150
You can see that Gary Vaynerchuk he is is a picture of him in the front of a magazine which is quite

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,840
a clever use of it gives him some social proof.

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,080
But again I can't really read any of that.

51
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,910
And maybe just a closer picture of the face would be better.

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,350
So in terms of your personal profile picture again to recap some of the best practices keep that shot

53
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,950
of the face pretty close.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I wouldn't bother putting any text in there trying to have a clear background if you can and dress appropriately

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,830
to watch your audience for expects that doesn't have to be business.

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,960
If you're into fitness you could be in your fitness clothes or whatever.

57
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,850
So that is a personal profile picture and always have a look at top influencers in YOUR needs to really

58
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,440
understand what they're doing.

59
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,050
And let's have a look at some actual business accounts.

60
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,640
So I want to show you a company here called HubSpot.

61
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,710
And I think they've done it quite well.

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,570
You can see actually they've got a number of accounts on Instagram here and what they've done is they

63
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,660
just have one background color and then a color for their logo only two colors.

64
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,130
And I'd recommend you follow that as well.

65
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,790
And then also you can see there's no text in there.

66
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,920
It's very simple.

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,530
Even if we click into in to look at one of their posts in the top left corner here it's still instantly

68
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,750
recognizable as them.

69
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,170
And it really pops off the page.

70
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,770
Now I want to show you another account that maybe isn't on as well just so you have that comparison

71
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,250
again.

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,110
So this company tends tile actually pretty interesting company.

73
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,960
They kind of have these tents that you tie up.

74
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,230
So pretty cool e-commerce company.

75
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,380
But you can see their logo here.

76
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,590
It is two colors but it's black and white.

77
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,380
And they have text on it also and it looks OK on their profile page.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,830
But then when we come into one of their posts you can see it's it's black on white so it doesn't really

79
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,970
pop off the page in the top left hand corner.

80
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,520
And also that text becomes unreadable.

81
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,020
Then there's no real need to include any text because the name of the account is right there.

82
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:46,300
So my opinion would be for them to change that logo maybe have an orange on wice and just keep that

83
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,310
kind of image removed that text and I think that would pop off a lot more on the page be more recognizable.

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,000
When people see these type of posts in their news feed.

85
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,270
So for a business it can't as well.

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,810
There are those best practices and if you want to come back and have a look at a good example HubSpot

87
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,980
you can see that they've done it well.

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,190
It's no tax just one color.

89
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,840
Navy's bright colors to make sure it really pops off the white background that goes on in school.

90
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:21,770
So once you have decided what profile picture you want to use to actually add the profile picture you

91
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,490
want to come in and click on settings.

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,390
Top right hand corner and it profile and then you can change your profile image.

93
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:36,600
Now the option here to import it from Facebook Twitter etc. or choose from your library.

94
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:44,460
I'm going to do now I've got a picture that I've uploaded to my phone before and this is as I've as

95
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,310
I've kind of recommended just two simple colors and just using this for a set up demo Cance.

96
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,640
And I think that looks pretty good.

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,990
I can click done and I just need to confirm my email which I'll do now.

98
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,040
And then I can just click on.

99
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,090
So if you come back to my profile you can see the profile image is loaded up.

100
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,490
I think it really does pop off the page.

101
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,730
Got a bright color backgrounds and that is how you really add a profile image to your Instagram accounts.

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,680
So now it's your turn.

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Go ahead and add their personal profile picture or business logo to your Instagram account following

104
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,440
the steps and best practices that you've learned in this video.
