When you're overtightening on Facebook it's important to understand how Facebook will organize your

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.970
ads.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.210
Facebook organizes your eyes into three levels campaigns and sets and ads and this structure makes it

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.520
easier for you to organize and optimize the performance of your ads.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.480
So here's how the structure works.

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.060
To run an ad on Facebook the first thing you'll do is choose an objective.

7
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.450
For example you may want to run a campaign to get traffic to generate leads or to increase conversions

8
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.710
for each different objective that you have.

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.910
You will set up a separate campaign.

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.030
Once you've chosen your objective the next level is the odd set and it's in here that you will define

11
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.960
your audience your schedule where your ads will appear and how much you will pay at the ad level.

12
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.420
It's all about what people will see and it's here you will define your odd creative or what will appear

13
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.550
in your ad like the image you use the length that you get people to click on and the messaging within

14
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.610
the band.

15
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.490
The key benefit of this structure is not only that it breaks down the steps.

16
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.800
Creating a campaign but it lets you test which ads perform better.

17
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.680
For example if you run a campaign to get traffic to your website you could test the responsiveness of

18
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.220
different audiences at the onset level by creating a separate set.

19
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.280
And you could test the responsiveness to different types of Yvonne's by creating new ads at the ad level

20
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.790
using maybe different photos videos and messages and with the ads reporting tool you will be able to

21
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.660
see which audiences respond most and which ads perform the best so that you can really do more of what's

22
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.810
working and get more out of your advertising campaigns.

23
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.190
Now that you understand the Facebook structure and how it can help you optimize your campaigns the next

24
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.680
step for you is to create your first AD and ask for starting in the next lecture.
