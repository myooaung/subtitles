1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,370
Let's take a look at building a more in‑depth look at

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,240
CodeArtifact and setting it up.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,160
First,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,380
we need to make sure you have the right

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,540
prerequisites required to use CodeArtifact.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,620
There's only one thing we need to have,

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,800
and we already have it set up, and that's IAM.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,250
Okay, so we already have everything set up and in place.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,230
Let's take a look at what CodeArtifact domains are.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,590
A domain is the highest level component of CodeArtifact.

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:47,140
It combines all of CodeArtifact's repositories in one group. You

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,600
cannot create a repository without a domain.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,740
The domain names are unique per account.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,000
You can combine repositories from other accounts and upstream

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,730
repositories in one domain. Domains handle deduplication of software

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:15,540
packages in your repository so it'll save space.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,440
We'll talk more about this later on.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,230
It allows for fast copying of packages between repositories by using metadata

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:35,440
using a deduplication process we'll talk more about on later.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,840
Using a domain, you can easily share packages across repositories and teams.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,440
It is the first point of contact.

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,330
It also allows you to easily set an IAM policy to all of your

23
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,340
repositories in one go, and we'll also find out how to do this.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,840
Okay, so we learned what a domain is in CodeArtifact.

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,990
Let's take a look at how to create one. In this demo,

26
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,740
we're going to cover how to create a CodeArtifact domain.

27
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,130
Here we are inside of the AWS CodeArtifact dashboard.

28
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,910
Let's go over to Domains. In here we're going to click

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,790
Create domain and then we'll give it a name.

30
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,440
So let's call it a globomantics‑domain.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,790
You can also configure a different customer managed

32
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,340
key that will encrypt your data.

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,240
Well, for simplicity during this demo I'm going to use the AWS one.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,020
Let's click Create domain. Boom, how easy was that?

35
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,390
So now we've just created our first domain and in here

36
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,640
are going to live our repositories.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
For the next thing, you need to know about

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,530
CodeArtifact domains or domain policies.

39
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,460
In this section,

40
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,310
I'll talk you through what they are and how to apply

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,440
them to your CodeArtifact domain.

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,640
You can attach a domain policy to an AWS CodeArtifact domain.

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,920
A domain policy is a resource level IAM access policy that you

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,360
can use to restrict or give access to your AWS CodeArtifact

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,240
repository inside of your domain.

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,680
When you attach a domain,

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,010
it is then applied to all of your repositories in that domain.

48
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,710
This is really handy if you want to quickly apply the same policy to

49
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,490
each repository. You can even use domain policies to allow

50
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,510
cross‑account access from different AWS accounts.

51
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,800
This is handy if you have a multi‑account architecture and want to use the

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,260
same software packages across all of your accounts. And the benefit of

53
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,840
this is it will save you time and also money.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,450
There are multiple ways to create a domain policy either

55
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,140
via the AWS CLI or using the dashboard.

56
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,680
Okay,

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,560
so now we know what a domain policy is and what it does, let's take a look at

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,340
how to create one and apply it to our CodeArtifact domain. In this demo we're

59
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,940
going to create a CodeArtifact domain policy.

60
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,940
Let's jump straight in.

61
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,230
Okay, so now we have a domain set up, let's go and give it a policy.

62
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,500
So at the top right,

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,640
I'm going to apply a domain policy. This policy that I'm pasting in

64
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,550
right now can be found inside the course documents,

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:05:00,940
and it's going to allow a simple set of basic access to our AWS account.

66
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm going to hit Save, and that's it. We now have domain policy set up and our domain.
