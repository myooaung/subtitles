00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.780
Okay, so now we have our domain set up with a policy.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.640
Let's have a look at what the repositories are.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.840
CodeArtifact repositories exist inside of a CodeArtifact domain.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.440
You can have multiple repositories inside of a domain,

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.840
but you cannot have multiple domains per repository.

6
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.330
A repository will contain software package versions,

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.360
which will point to a software package asset.

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.010
A repository can contain multiple types of software packages such as npm

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.520
and pit together and is known as a polyglot repository.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.490
Something else that's pretty cool about software packages

11
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.060
and repositories is if you copy a package from another

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.400
repository inside of your domain, it will not take up double the amount of space.

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.640
Instead, it will essentially point to the original software package.

14
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.760
When you create a repository,

15
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.340
it will not automatically add any software packages to the repository.

16
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.310
Each repository you create will be associated with the

17
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.560
AWS account you used to create it,

18
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.140
and each account can hold up to 10,000 repositories.

19
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.470
After you create a repository, you cannot change its name after the fact,

20
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.650
so make sure you pick the right name.

21
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.370
And you can also have multiple upstream repositories.

22
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.640
This is something we're going to talk about later on.

23
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.940
Okay, so we just learned about what a repository is inside of CodeArtifact.

24
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.120
Next, let's take a look at how to create one and set one up.

25
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.340
In this demo, we're going to have a look at creating a CodeArtifact repository.

26
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.240
Let's jump straight in.

27
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.340
Okay, so the next step is creating our first repository.

28
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
So here I am, back inside of our Globomantics domain that were created earlier,

29
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.550
and I'm going to click over at Create repository.

30
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.020
I'm going to give it a name.

31
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.840
I'm going to call it the globomantics‑repository, or repo for short.

32
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.520
You can give it a description if you want.

33
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.840
I'm going to not.

34
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.080
And you can also select upstream repositories,

35
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.540
but I'm going to cover this in a little bit more detail later on.

36
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140
Let's hit Next.

37
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.540
That looks all great to me, and I'm just going to hit Create repository.

38
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.390
So, there we have it.

39
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.940
That was our first repository setup inside of CodeArtifact.

40
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.710
Inside of this is where all of your software packages are going to live.

41
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.570
The next thing you need to know about CodeArtifact

42
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.540
repositories are repository policies.

43
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.850
In this next section,

44
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.440
I'll talk you through what they are and how to apply

45
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.440
them to your CodeArtifact repository.

46
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.840
You can attach a policy to a CodeArtifact repository.

47
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.160
A repository policy is a resource‑level IAM access policy that you can use to

48
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.340
restrict or give access to your CodeArtifact repository.

49
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.380
When you attach a repository policy,

50
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.740
it's then applied to just that single repository.

51
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.440
This is really handy if you want to restrict access to each

52
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.990
repository on a per‑repository basis, and you can create a policy,

53
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.440
which allows other AWS accounts to have access.

54
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.440
There are multiple ways to create a repository policy,

55
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.240
either via the AWS CLI or the dashboard.

56
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.140
Okay, so we just learned what repository policy is.

57
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.540
Let's take a look at how to create one. In this demo, we're going to

58
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.410
cover the following component, we're going to create a CodeArtifact

59
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.540
repository policy and attach it to our repository.

60
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.110
Cool.

61
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.130
So we have our repo set up.

62
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.730
Let's go ahead and create a repository policy.

63
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.500
I go and apply a repository policy by clicking this button up here.

64
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.150
Next,

65
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.620
I'm going to paste in this policy that can be found in the course

66
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.270
documents. Similar to before, this policy is going to allow me

67
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.160
access from my account to this repository.

68
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.890
I'm going to hit Save, and boom, there we have it.

69
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.990
That's our repo fully set up and waiting to be used.

70
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.920
Okay, so we just covered CodeArtifact domains, and we set one up,

71
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.300
and we learned about what they are and where they fit

72
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.040
inside of the CodeArtifact architecture.

73
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.710
We had a look at securing it with a policy.

74
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.840
We then had a look at what repositories are and where they sit

75
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.330
inside of the CodeArtifact architecture.

76
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.460
And then we also looked at securing that with a

77
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.000
repository policy too. Super simple, super easy to use, and this is why CodeArtifact is so great.
