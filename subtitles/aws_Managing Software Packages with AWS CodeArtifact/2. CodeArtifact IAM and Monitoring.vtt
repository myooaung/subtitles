00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.490
First off, to start using AWS CodeArtifact,

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.750
we're going to need to make sure your user has some access

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.290
and permissions set up to allow the right levels of access

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.730
to use the service required.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.890
In the first series of demos,

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.740
I'm going to show how to allow and restrict access to AWS CodeArtifact in IAM.

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.340
Okay, so here we are in the IAM dashboard.

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.240
Let's go ahead and have a look at the CodeArtifact policies.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.030
If we search CodeArtifact in the search bar,

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.920
we should be able to see two policies,

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.140
a ReadOnlyAccess policy and AdminAccess policy.

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.250
We're going to use the AdminAccess one,

13
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.040
and the read‑only one is pretty self‑explanatory.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.050
If we have a look at what services this policy allows

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.510
us to access within CodeArtifact, we'll see lists,

16
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.930
gets, describes, creates, deletes, and updates.

17
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.240
Pretty standard stuff, right?

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.040
So let's go ahead and create our group for our CodeArtifact user.

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.190
So let's create a developer group,

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.040
and then let's give them the codeartifact policy.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.940
We're going to select the AdminAccess one.

22
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.040
You might use the ReadOnly one for maybe a QA or a tester

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.650
who just needs to check over the repo.

24
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:38.240
And let's create that group, add our user to the group.

25
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.440
Perfect.

26
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.610
Now you should be all set up to go ahead and use CodeArtifact as an admin.

27
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.210
Okay, so now we finished the demo,

28
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.920
I just want to quickly recap over the policies we've seen.

29
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.840
We've see in the CodeArtifactAdminAccess policy,

30
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.120
and we had a quick look at the CodeArtifactReadOnlyAccess.

31
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.580
Next, in this section,

32
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.940
we're going to cover monitoring AWS CodeArtifact actions and events.

33
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.300
These are important to keep your environment secure,

34
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.940
like we talked about earlier, and we can show how to order events if needed.

35
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.800
Okay, so in the next walkthrough,

36
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.650
we're going to take a look at the API call logs in CloudTrail for CodeArtifact.

37
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.730
Let's jump straight in.

38
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.440
Okay, so here we are in the CloudTrail dashboard.

39
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.490
Let's go over to Event history. In here, we can set the

40
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.140
event source to codeartifact.amazonaws.com.

41
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.340
And we can see and hear a list of all the different actions my

42
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.140
user has taken in the past against CodeArtifact.

43
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.640
If we open up one of these, we can see that here I've used the

44
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.750
GetRepositoryEndpoint API, and we can see when I've done it and my source

45
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.260
IP address. We can even drill into this further and see the actual JSON

46
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:20.940
request that is sent. Super cool and very secure.

47
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.680
Okay, first module finished.

48
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.260
That wasn't so bad, was it?

49
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.840
And we're well on our way to becoming CodeArtifact pros.

50
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.340
Let's have a quick recap at what we just covered.

51
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.940
We had a look at what CodeArtifact was and we gave an introduction.

52
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.880
We had a look at an overview of the service, we had a

53
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.770
look at managing the permissions,

54
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.000
and then we had a look at monitoring the actions. Let's go on and have a look at our next module.
