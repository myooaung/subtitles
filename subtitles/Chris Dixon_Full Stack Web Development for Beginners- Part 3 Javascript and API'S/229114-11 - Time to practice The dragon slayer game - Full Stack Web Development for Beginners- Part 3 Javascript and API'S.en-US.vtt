00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
We're now going to take a little time out from learning about

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.320
conditional statements to put them into practice in a fun game called, the dragon slayer.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.335
They will be pretty simple but it will get us thinking about what we want to do next,

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.070
based on the condition.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.815
When we first finish the page and this is the finished projects,

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:23.050
we first asked our name.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.400
We can then enter our name and then click okay.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.970
Then we'll move on to our next screen where we're asked if we

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.150
would like to play with our name inside the string.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.215
If we cancel, we get a textile, maybe next time.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:42.630
However, if we reload the game at our name,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.040
click okay, and then we say,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.735
would you like to play and click on okay.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.500
We then move on to being asked if who'd like to bow the dragon.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.060
Again if we cancel,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.195
we'll get a message of come back when you brave enough.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:01.400
However, if we go through and play the game at our name, would you like to play?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.595
Yes. Would you like to battle a dragon? Click okay.

00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:09.020
We then have a random chance of where will be the dragon.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.320
This time we've defeated the dragon because we compare this to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.100
a random number which determines if we win or loose.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.945
There's a 50-50 chance,

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.595
what this message will be.

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:21.230
Let's give this one more go.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.530
If we refresh at our name and then click through,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.115
this time it says we've lost.

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:32.315
You can give this a go if you feel comfortable doing so,

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:34.670
and I would really encourage you to do this,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.235
if not just to get some more practice.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:41.750
The only thing we have not yet covered is generating random numbers,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.660
but you can easily look the slope if you want to.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.310
Otherwise, I'm going to go ahead and build this now.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.470
Let's close this off,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.755
and then go to the starter files for the dragon slayer game.

00:01:54.755 --> 00:02:00.155
Down in the script, I'm going to begin by creating a variable called random,

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:03.920
and this is only section which we haven't yet covered.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.730
To generate a random number,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.030
we use math dot random,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.155
and then the brackets just like this,

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:16.735
and then let's do a console log for the word random.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.440
Save and then reload,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.725
and in fact is when you go to our project,

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.890
open up the console,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.595
and there's our random number.

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:30.350
If we keep refreshing,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.855
we get different values each time.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:38.295
A random number in java script by default is between zero or one.

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:41.895
Zero being included, but one not been included,

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:46.145
so this will end up with the highest value of 0.999.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:47.975
If you keep refreshing,

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:51.320
we don't see any values higher than one.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.615
To make this easy for us,

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:57.580
we're going to generate a random number between zero and 99.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.275
To do this, we can first multiply the random number by 100,

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:06.904
and this will give us a number if we refresh,

00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:09.245
which is between zero and 99,

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:12.185
but with lots of different decimal places.

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:14.585
If we want this to be a whole number,

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:17.795
we can either round this number up or down.

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:21.140
We can run the number down with math dot floor,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.970
or if we want to round the number up,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.460
we can say math dot ceil,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.800
which is short for ceiling,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.245
and then surrounds the rest of our code inside the brackets.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.625
Now if we save, and then reload,

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:39.195
we get a random number which is rounded.

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.100
Now we've taken care of this random number,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.805
and the way we're going to use this is we're going to check,

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:48.170
if this number is less than 50, if it is,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.180
we'll say you defeated the dragon,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.475
if the random number is over 50,

00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:54.265
will say you've lost.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:56.945
Let's get back to work with this game.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.700
We can remove the console.log,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.675
and then we are going to set a second variable of name,

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:10.325
and this name is going to be the value passed in by the user inside of a prompts.

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:13.260
What is your name?

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.480
This will add a prompt to the user asking for the name which we can type in,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.980
and this value is stored inside this variable.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.580
Next often want to create a new variable called play,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.960
and this is for our second screen,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.585
which is going to be a confirm.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:35.825
Inside the confirm we can say hello,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:39.450
add a space and then add the user's name.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.985
This is a screen which you seen inside the final version.

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:47.255
First of all, we get what's your name?

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:50.200
When you type in your name, we can say, okay,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.970
and this section here is the one which restoring inside a play.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.680
So hello name, and then the text string of, would you like to play?;

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.415
Now we need to do some conditional checks.

00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:18.140
First of all, we're going to check if the user has selected play.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.360
If play is true,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.880
then we want to run some code.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.075
If the user has chosen to play the game,

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.955
would then want to create a new confirm,

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:31.565
and this time we're going to ask the question of,

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:33.930
would you like to battle a dragon?;

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.425
If we go to the finished version,

00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:49.710
just here, let's reload, what's your name?

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.975
Then we have the section would you like to play?

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:56.620
If okay, this is a section which you just created saying,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.610
would you like to battle a dragon?

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.350
We need to store this inside a variable.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.720
I'm going to call mine battle, and change them.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.040
Now we have a true or false value inside this variable called battle.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.565
If the user wants to go ahead and play,

00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:18.055
we can then create a new if statements,

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:21.085
and this time nested inside a play.

00:06:21.085 --> 00:06:26.180
We'll say if battle is true,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.065
then inside here we want a battle,

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:35.925
or if the users clicked on cancel battle will be false,

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:39.075
and then we need to provide else statements,

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:42.850
so we'll say not battling.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.530
First of all, let's deal with the else statement.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.130
If the user has chose not to battle,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.244
will simply do an alert,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:55.980
and so alert can say 'comeback when you are brave enough'.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.835
Let's first give us a test in the browser or to our projects.

00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:10.030
Let's refresh. What's your name?

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.615
Type this in and we'll say,

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:16.150
'hello Chris, would you like to play?'

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.875
This is this section here,

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:21.615
saying would you like to play?

00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:24.060
If play is true, we then asked,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.720
'would you like to ball the dragon', which you see here?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.370
Remember we've not set a condition,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.705
if this is true yet,

00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:35.465
we've only set condition if the user clicks cancel.

00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:39.210
If the user cancels, we should get this message here.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:45.250
Let's try this, and there we get 'come back when you brave enough'.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.525
Now we need to handle the condition,

00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:51.000
if the user clicks on "okay".

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.595
Let's add a condition is the user decides to battle.

00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:59.405
Before we set up these random number between zero and 99,

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:01.970
and stored it in a variable called random,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.220
each time we run a random,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.400
we can then use the ternary operator to check if this is greater than 50,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.240
if it is, we can then say,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.530
'you defeated the dragon!;

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.555
'if this number is less than 50'.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:27.310
We can then say you lost.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.640
Save that, and let's give this a go.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.460
Type anything into there, 'would like to play'?

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.680
Yes. 'Would you like to battle?'

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.610
Okay, and we don't see any results on the screen.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.380
This is because we've created our ternary operator but,

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.455
we've not displayed the results on the screen.

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:53.225
Let's set the result to be a variable called results,

00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:56.110
and set this to our ternary operator.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.690
Then just after this,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:04.000
we can do a console.log with the value of results,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:10.300
and in fact we'll change this be an alert just like the rest.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.645
Save, and then over to the browser, 'what's your name?'.'

00:09:14.645 --> 00:09:16.805
Would like to play?'Yes,

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:18.595
'would like to battle?'

00:09:18.595 --> 00:09:23.280
Okay. So we lost that time, let's try again.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.035
'Would you like to play?'

00:09:25.035 --> 00:09:29.060
Yes, and this time we defeated the dragon,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.850
because the random number must be in over 50, good.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.935
Those who've handled most of the used cases here,

00:09:36.935 --> 00:09:38.715
is the used ones to play,

00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:40.710
is the used ones to battle.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.485
The last case to handle,

00:09:42.485 --> 00:09:45.660
is if the user doesn't want to play at all.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.350
If we refresh the browser,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.940
this time if we type our name in,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.480
and click on okay.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.495
We then want to handle the case if the user doesn't want to play,

00:09:56.495 --> 00:10:00.430
currently inside the here we're checking if the user wants to play,

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.640
and if they do, we then run this code.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.295
Instead, if the user clicks on cancel,

00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:10.440
would then want to alert message saying 'maybe next time'.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.015
We can do this as an else statements at the very bottom,

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:22.480
so else, we'll do an alert of 'maybe next time'.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.400
Save that and give us a go.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.925
'What's your name?' Click okay.

00:10:32.925 --> 00:10:34.380
'Would you like to play?'

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.939
This time we'll click cancel,

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:38.485
and the message of maybe next time.

00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:40.895
Great everything is now working,

00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:43.040
and hope you enjoy playing this game.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.015
Don't worry if it was something which you couldn't quite manage,

00:10:46.015 --> 00:10:49.310
there's quite a lot taken there and each step just

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.480
take a little bit of thinking about to decide what we're going to do next.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.350
Hoping all are looking forward to the next section and I'll see you there.
