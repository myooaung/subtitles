00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.820
Welcome back guys. So as you already know,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.370
this is the third part in the series.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.010
It's not essential that the first two parts are

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.890
completed before continuing with this course,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.000
you can just Zoom straight in if you just want to learn about JavaScript and APIs.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.800
However, if you have not completed the early sections,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.770
something you will need to progress with this course is

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.325
the starter files for the song find application.

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:31.915
If you go to the class and click on your project is here.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:35.590
Later on in the course when we begin to work with APIs,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.245
will have the song finder.zip,

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:43.695
HTML and CSS, or dictated from the earlier sections of the course.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:46.550
If you've not already completed these,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.910
just simply download this HTML and CSS data.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.690
Then you can continue with this cause as normal.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.885
But if you take any earlier parts or not,

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:59.450
you will also need the JavaScript starter files.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.730
These will include all HTML,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.465
and CSS to get us started with learning JavaScript.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:11.540
This we'll say was creating the JavaScript skeleton structures or each individual lesson.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.515
So we can dive straight in to learn in our JavaScripts.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:19.400
So go ahead and download the files which you need.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.640
Then let's move on to learning all about JavaScripts.
