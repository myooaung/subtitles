00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.845
Another type of conditional statement is called the ternary operator,

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.945
so make sure you're in number seven,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.240
which is E ternary operator starter file.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.735
Then we can get to work in the script section below.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:18.915
The ternary operator is often used as a shorter alternative to the if else statements.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.360
It's also a one-line statement,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.760
so it can look a little simpler to.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.315
We begin by adding a condition we want to check,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.445
such as a calculation.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:33.225
We say ten is greater than five.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.930
The condition is then followed by the question mark,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.045
then we declare what we want to happen if the result is true or false.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.570
The first statement is true,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.050
separated by a colon,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.560
and the second one is false.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.850
What we're saying here is if ten is greater than five,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.300
the first one is printed text of true,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.915
the second one is simply printed text of false.

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:01.775
If we save this in and open up this file in the browser,

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:05.900
refresh, we don't see anything happen at first.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.735
This is because we need to output the answer,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.045
such as a console log.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:15.110
Before this lets add a console.log and then

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.280
inside the bracket we can add this full ternary operator.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.985
Now if we save, refresh and then open up the console,

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.505
click on the console tab,

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.040
and then we've got the text of true,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.845
because ten is greater than five.

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:36.545
If we change this to be ten is less than five,

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:39.665
we then get the second option of false.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.305
Let's try this and that falls inside the browser.

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.950
Later, we'll also look at some ways to display things on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.535
a web-page rather than in the console or using alerts.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:53.185
We can also stall this results in a variable too.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:02:03.220
Let's go back over and add our variable of hungry on small and search value of true.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.935
I should move this console log and then we can say, var,

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:14.110
should I eat, then we can set this to our ternary operator.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.475
The condition we want to check is if hungry.

00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:19.490
If this value is true,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.005
where the question mark,

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.210
and then add our two options.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.460
If it's true, we'll say,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.465
yes, let's eat, separated by a colon.

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:34.185
If it's false, we'll say not just yet,

00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:39.840
add a semicolon at the end of there and then we can do a console log.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.310
Then log the results of should I eat.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.110
Just a recap, we check in this variable here,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.625
if it's true or false.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.285
If it's true, we'll print in the text of Yes, let's eat.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.160
If this were set to be false,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.080
we'll then get the second value of not just yet.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.510
This result is installed inside a variable called should I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.025
eat and this is a value which will display in, inside the console.

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:09.080
After the console now,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.675
this is set to true, so we get, yes, let's eat.

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:17.130
If this was false, not just yet.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.745
There is lots more uses for this tool,

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:23.240
such as constructing a text string with outcome.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.590
If we were to go ahead and say variable is logged in,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.995
and we'll set this initially to be a value of false.

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:37.000
Then we can go ahead and add a text string of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.290
hello with space and then inside the brackets we can add our ternary operator.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.875
First of all, we're going to check our condition of login,

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.975
the question mark, and then our two options.

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:55.045
First of all, if this is true,

00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:57.670
we can then say welcome back.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.290
Separated by a colon,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.100
we add our false condition.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:11.020
We can say please log into your account and a semicolon at the very end.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.480
Now we need a way to display this to the user so

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.995
we can surround this whole section inside of an alert.

00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:22.130
Then the brackets are the very start and then it closes alert

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.700
off right at the very end with a closing brackets. There we go.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.985
Let's make sure we have the two brackets at the end,

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:33.830
one for the alert and the second one for this logged in section.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.930
Give that save, reload.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.620
First of all, we've got the text saying, "hello,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.715
please log into your account" because we're not logged in.

00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:47.705
However, if we set this to be a value of true,

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:49.580
therefore we're logged in,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.500
reload and we'll get the message of Hello welcome back.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.480
This ternary operator is really simple to use

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.280
and also a good alternative to the if-else statement.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.350
It's also a little bit more compact on McCann add this

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.170
all on one line to not only shot in our code,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.880
but also make it more readable.
