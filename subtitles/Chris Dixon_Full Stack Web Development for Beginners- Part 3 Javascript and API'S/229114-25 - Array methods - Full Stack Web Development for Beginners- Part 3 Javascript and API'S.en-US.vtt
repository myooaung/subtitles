00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.875
In our starter file for this video, which is number 22,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.840
array methods, we have

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.550
a similar looking array of animals to the last video, which is just here.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
We then display them in a div with the id of animals who brought this

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.355
up to get elements by ID is down at the very bottom this time,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.750
which you can see here.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.720
This is because before we can get to display this Array,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.385
there is some built-in methods we can use called Array Methods.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.325
There's quite a lot of these methods we can use.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.055
Here we're going to look at some of the most common ones.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:42.915
Include how to add and remove values from an array using JavaScript, starting with shift.

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:46.115
If we scroll up to the first comment which is just hear,

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.475
shift will remove the first element from our array,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.630
which in our case is cat.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.315
All we need to do is access the Array by its name and then say dot shift.

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:03.870
It is simple as that, now if we open up this Array Methods inside the browser,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.530
we now see our first value of cat is now removed.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.905
This is our new Array return back towards,

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:13.690
now we only have our four values.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.295
We can also store this removed item in a variable if we wanted to.

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:21.620
All we need to do is assign a variable such as

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.915
animal1 and set this equal to our values of animals.shift.

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:30.055
Then we can check this out inside the console.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:34.820
So console log, and that's outputs the value of animal one,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.005
save, inspect inside the console.

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.695
There as as expected, we have our first value of cats.

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:49.640
Instead, if we wanted to add items to the beginning of the Array,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.430
we can use unshift to add as many items as we want.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.240
Slides comments out these two lines here,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.175
and then move down to unshift.

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:04.685
Here we can start with the animals array,

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:09.215
just like before, and then select the unshift method.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:13.490
Again followed by the brackets and a semicolon, and then as a string,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.395
I'm going to add some new animals,

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:19.460
such as leopard, separated by a comma,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.500
a second value of bird.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.480
Let's see if our Leopard and bird is now inside the browser.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.440
That goes now got leopard and bird pushed to the start of our Array.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.025
This new array is returned to us with these new editions,

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.890
the shift and unshift, a like a pair.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.820
They both modify the beginning of an array.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.605
The next tool, which is called Push and Pop,

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.930
modify the end of an Array.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.595
Let's start with push,

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:50.995
which will add one or more values to the end of this array.

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:53.355
Let's comment out this line here.

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:55.590
Move down to push.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.800
Starting with our animals Array,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.990
we can use the dot push method.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.985
Then inside here we can add some more values.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's add our leopard and then our bird.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.510
This time to the end of an Array, refresh,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.320
so there's our first five items from before,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.075
and then our last two pushed to the end of the Array.

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:24.080
Next up we have pop,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.790
which is pretty straightforward.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.120
We'll call the pop method to remove the last item of the Array.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.935
Comment out this line here and down to the pop section here,

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:40.760
this is pretty simple, this is just like when we use animals.shift,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.650
but this time we use animals.pop.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.435
We don't add any values inside the brackets because we're simply removing the last item,

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:57.065
save this, reload, and our last value is removed from the original Array.

00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:00.860
These four methods are great but they are limited to

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.805
only working with the beginning or the end of an Array.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:08.899
To remove or to add items in different positions,

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:11.470
we can use the splice method.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.250
Make sure all the methods we have just looked at are commented out,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.140
and we returned to the original Array with our five items,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.380
then we can call animals.splice.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.540
Just here, you see splice method came with the brackets and the semicolon.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.805
To begin removing items,

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:39.745
we need to add in two values inside these brackets or parentheses.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:45.110
Let's say we wanted to remove this tiger, which is just here.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.975
Remember, Arrays begin at position zero,

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:51.470
meaning the tiger would be at index position two.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.555
Our first value is two,

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:57.730
so make sure this is spelled correctly.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.570
Splice just like that.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.575
Then we add our first position, which is two.

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:06.290
If you just have one value like this,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.180
all Items after number two will also be deleted.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.550
Just like that. Everything from tiger onward is removed,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.655
or we can add a second value,

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:19.860
which is a number of items to remove.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.850
Setting needs to be one,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.350
we will only remove our tiger volume,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.600
leaving our giraffe and lion on the end.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.205
This is how we can remove items.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.500
But if instead we wanted to replace this item,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.675
so if we wanted to replace the lion,

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:38.545
we can just add in some values after this.

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:40.515
Separated by a comma,

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:44.170
let's replace a lion with a fish.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.430
Reload, and there we go.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.210
We still have our original cat, dog, giraffe,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.670
lion, both fish now replaces our value of tiger.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.260
We can also add multiple items in two,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.380
all we need to do is separate these by a comma.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.035
Let's go for a monkey this time,

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:07.360
refresh, and there's our access to items in the middle.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.285
Let's wrap this video up with one more,

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:12.760
which is how to reverse the Array,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.130
which returned in reverse order.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.230
All we need to do is go down to a reverse section and select the

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.880
animals.reverse brackets and semicolon.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.655
Remember from before our lion is at the end and the cat is at the beginning.

00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:34.265
If we refresh, this is now swapped over.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:38.880
There is also some more Array Methods too which can do various things,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.020
and we'll cover more of these soon.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.675
If you interested in a full list,

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:50.030
just head over to Google and then do a search for Mozilla Array Methods.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.540
It's answer, and it should be the first result which props up.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.315
Select this, and then we can scroll down to the method section,

00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:07.385
which is quite a bit down.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:11.585
Let's keep going, there's our properties which we looked at Array.length.

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:13.525
Here is our methods too,

00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:18.110
feel free to take look through all these different methods and find out how they work.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.065
We've looked at some of these so far, so just, splice,

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:24.940
shift, unshift, push and reverse.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.185
This is it now for this video,

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:29.610
and I will see you next time.
