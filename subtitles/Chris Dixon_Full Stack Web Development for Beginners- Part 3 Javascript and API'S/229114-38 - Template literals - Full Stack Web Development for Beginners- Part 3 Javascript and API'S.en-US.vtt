00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.250
Welcome back. There is now some basic functionality in our game.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.500
We generate two random shapes when we click on this Play button at the top.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.190
At the moment though these shapes are just inside the console.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.710
But in this video, we'll be actually displaying

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.470
these shapes on the screen for the player to compare.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.890
We're going to do be doing this pile also learning about how to use template literals.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.100
This will basically allow us to create a text string which variables passed inside.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.920
We've already looked at some ways to include variables with strings.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.580
Let's go over to our scripts.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.170
We've already looked at methods like this.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.195
If you've created a variable such as name and set this to be the value of Chris,

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.275
then do a console log.

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:57.270
Inside here, we've added strings to variables,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.029
let's say "Hello", a space,

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:02.710
and then add our name.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.405
Onto the console and now we'll expect the value of Hello Chris.

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:11.810
Using template literals rather than joining

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.810
these strings and variables with the plus symbol,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.450
we can construct one single string by using backticks.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.260
Let's remove all of this from here,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.545
and then if you look for the backtick on your keyboard,

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.330
which is this symbol just here,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.210
then we can type in the value of Hello inside.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.315
Then instead of joining on our variable name,

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:38.365
we can add this variable inside of the backticks.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:43.235
Can pass in our expression of variable first using a $ symbol,

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.215
and then inside the curly braces,

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:47.470
we can add our variable name,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.785
which just looks like this.

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:52.430
If we save this and go over to the console,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.635
we see the same value is now working in the browser.

00:01:56.635 --> 00:02:02.240
Another thing we can do with template literals is to have multi-line text.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.145
If we wanted quite a long string just like this,

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.730
and then continue this down on the second line.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.180
We instantly see with these two different colors

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.085
here that our text editor is highlighting an error.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.460
To do this in the traditional way,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.805
we would need wrap each line inside the quotes,

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:25.310
add a line break,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.145
and then join it back together with the plus symbol.

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:31.565
However when using these newer template literals,

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:35.165
we can just replace the quotes with backticks,

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:37.640
such as this quote from here,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.290
add a backtick, also at the starts.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.440
Now this is all the same color,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.290
so it now appears to be working,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.700
we don't have the error anymore.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.020
Over to the console and there's our multi-line string which preserves the line breaks.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.395
Now we can remove this example from before.

00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:00.740
Great now we know how to use these template literals.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.630
We can put them into practice inside of our projects.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.190
Up to our function,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.800
which is the repeat random shape, first,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.620
we can remove these two console logs because we want to output these to the screen.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.505
Then we can create a string to contain our styles.

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:23.720
The styles which we want to contain is these sections of the objects.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.510
We want the color, we want the width,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.225
and also the heights,

00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:32.270
and we're going to set these as style properties of our shapes.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.385
Back down to our function,

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:37.165
let's go ahead and do this now.

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:39.660
Inside of our set interval,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.715
just blow our shape 2 here.

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:44.935
I'm going to go ahead and create a new constant.

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:47.220
Let's start with shape on.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.500
Let's call this shape1Styles.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.210
We're going to create a template literal,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.754
which is basically going to be a string with all of our styles contains.

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:01.550
We can then add the styles to our shapes div,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.000
and then this will display on the screen.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.455
Let's take a look at this with the backticks.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:12.740
First of all we're going to set the width of our div inside these backticks,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.025
we can add the $ symbol and then the curly braces to add our variable.

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.585
The variable once set to this width,

00:04:20.585 --> 00:04:24.900
is the value of a width of each object.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.749
Back down, let's set this be shape1,

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.400
which is stored inside this variable here.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.955
Shape1.width, and then we need to add the value of pixel on the end.

00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:41.720
Add plus px, semicolon after this,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.035
then we want to add this on the next line so it's more clear.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:47.790
The background this time.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.704
Let's add this to our $ symbol,

00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:53.550
open up the braces,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.155
and the background could be shape1.color,

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:59.045
semicolon at the end.

00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:01.405
Then finally the heights.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:05.870
This is going to be equal to our variable inside here,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.170
and this is shape1.height,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.370
and then again we need to also add onto the end our pixel value.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.415
Plus px, semicolon at the end,

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:20.375
and make sure these backticks is right at the very end

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:24.355
and right at the very start and not after each line.

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:28.550
Now we'll have these styles we can apply them to our shapes div.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.340
If we go over to our index page,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.490
we have an empty div with shape1 and also the shape2.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.350
We're going to add these style properties to this div here.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.040
First, let's select shape1 using document.getElementById, just select this.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:57.845
Just after here, let's go back over to the start and do a document.getElementById.

00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:00.900
We want to grab shape1.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.805
Then what we're going to do is something which we've looked at earlier.

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:08.705
We're going to set the style attribute for this div.

00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:15.170
We're going to set the cssText to be equal to the string which is created,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.445
which is stored in this constant called shape1Styles.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:23.225
Let's add this as our cssText.

00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:28.140
Shape1Styles with the semicolon at the end.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.355
This cssText which we just used here,

00:06:31.355 --> 00:06:34.220
is not something we've seen yet during this course.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.120
This will allow us to pass in a string of styles,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.755
just like we created here,

00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:42.850
stored in a variable called shape1Styles.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.470
Now lets check this is working in the browser.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.930
If we save this and then reload,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.840
we can close the console down and click on play.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.400
Great, that's our shape1 div on the left-hand side here.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.700
Now we can see all the style properties,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.740
such as the color, the height,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.250
and width, and now apply in as a style attributes,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.380
which we've added just here.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.745
Now what we need to do is repeat this for our shape2.

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:14.910
Let's copy our shape1 here,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.150
and then we could paste this in just below,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.210
and then let's move this over to keep it all lined up nicely.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.745
Now what we need to do is just change shape1 to be shape2.

00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:34.790
The same for all these ones inside of here we can change this to be

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:41.280
shape2 except for the color and also for the height too,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.620
and then just as before we can copy this line of code here,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.015
we can also select the document.getElementById.

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:53.630
This time we want to select the shape2 div,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.330
which is over in the index page,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.600
which is this div here.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.155
Exactly the same we do style.cssText,

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:08.770
and this is going to be equal to shape2Styles.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.355
Add a semicolon at the end,

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:15.580
and then close the browser,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.325
reload and hopefully we should get two random shapes when we click "Play".

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:24.395
Great, now these two shapes are on the screen,

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:26.585
we now need a way to compare them.

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:30.510
And this is what we'll look at in the next video.
