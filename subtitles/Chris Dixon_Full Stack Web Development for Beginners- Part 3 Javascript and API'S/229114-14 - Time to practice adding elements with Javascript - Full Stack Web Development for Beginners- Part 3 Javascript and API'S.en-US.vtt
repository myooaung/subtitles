00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
We've covered some ways to add,

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:05.475
update, and remove elements from the DOM.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.580
The best way for all this to stick is to get

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.325
some practice on your own without following along with me.

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:14.520
In this challenge, I would like you to go ahead and

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.250
create some elements using JavaScript.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.455
It doesn't need to be too complex.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:22.035
Just something like you see here is fine.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.280
With some text at the top of the page followed by an image.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.465
These can be placed inside a container and then

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:33.205
add to the image and the text as child items.

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:39.260
Also, you will need to add the image sauce and all the attributes to using Java Scripts.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.015
Recovered has to do this in a DOM manipulation video.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:47.975
If you go over to the starter file on the Number 12, time to practice.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:52.750
Inside here you'll find some basic code to get you started.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.685
All we need to do is create a JavaScript version of this HTML code we see here.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:00.980
Good luck with this. Once you are done,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.410
we'll move on to JavaScript functions.
