00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.660
Let's head over to our starter files and into our nesting conditional statements section.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.675
Here in our last example was a simple if-else to check if the condition is true.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:16.950
So we check if the variable of "hungry" was set to true.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.620
If it was, we alerted the text on "Get some food".

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.085
Otherwise, we'll get the text of "Maybe later".

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:26.720
Sometimes we may want to check if

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.485
more than one condition is true before running our code.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.905
For this, we can nest our if-else statements.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.535
To see this in action, I'm going to add a second variable.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:40.970
So let's add a second variable of "craving",

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.250
and I want to set this to "Pizza".

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.590
Then inside of this first "if" section,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.740
I'm going to nest in a second "if" statements.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.710
Let's make some space to make this more clear,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.115
so we'll say if "craving" is equal to "Pizza",

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:04.830
then we can add our block of code to say alert,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.800
"Gimme pizza", and we can also remove this alert from here too.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.985
So first we check in if the condition is true by checking if the person is hungry.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.295
If it's true, it will then also do

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:27.245
a second check to see if the craving is equal to pizza,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.530
and then it will say "Gimme pizza".

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.970
Else, we'll get the text of "Maybe later".

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.440
Let's save that and open this up in the browser and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.165
refresh and there's a text of "Gimme pizza".

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:43.860
But what if the first condition was true,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.565
if hungry but you aren't craving pizza?

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:53.890
So let's change this variable to something else, such as, "Chinese".

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.270
Save that and then refresh.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.315
So we don't see any alerts.

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:03.745
This is because although hungry is set to true,

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:06.870
craving is no longer set to "pizza".

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.675
Therefore, this alert won't run.

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:13.685
For this case, we can also provide a "else" statement,

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:16.865
which is also nested inside of here.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:20.165
So "else", and then inside this block,

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:27.850
we can put a alert with the text of "Lets get some food".

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.060
Remember if you wanted to add an apostrophe in like this,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.705
this single quotation is the same as the two outers,

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:42.530
so we'd need to change this to be double quotations for this to work.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.885
Give that a save, and then if we go over to the browser and then reload,

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:49.735
we get the text of, "Let's get some food".

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:53.995
This is because this "if" statement is originally true,

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:57.110
so therefore it will move on to the second one here.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.935
We're not craving pizza,

00:02:58.935 --> 00:03:00.825
so we don't get this alert here.

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:05.860
Any overvalue will cause the "else" statement to run and then print out the text of,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.910
"Let's get some food", and as expected,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.805
if we change "hungry" to be false,

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:14.255
this "if" statement won't run at all.

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:19.350
Instead, the "else" statement will run and we'll get a text of "Maybe later".

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.795
So this is how we can nest if-else statements inside of others.

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:28.940
We can go even further and nest inside of this "if" statement too,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.535
but generally we don't want to go too deep

00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:34.880
because this makes our code more complex and unreadable,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.630
and there's often more elegant solutions to this.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.550
This is how we can nest our conditional statements,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.770
and next up we'll take a look at else-if.
