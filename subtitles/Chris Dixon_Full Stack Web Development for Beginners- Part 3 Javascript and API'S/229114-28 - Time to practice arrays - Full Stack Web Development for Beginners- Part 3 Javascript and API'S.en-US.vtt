00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Before we move on to looking at more types of loops,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.830
I think we should take a breather and make sure we understand what

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.970
we've covered so far with arrays and also looping through them.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.430
Over in the Stata files,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.620
so open up the sidebar and go to number

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.870
25 which is time to practice and then let's open this up.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.410
Let's copy the path and then open this up inside of the browser.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.740
Over in the Stata file,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.350
I've added some instructions for a little challenge to give you some more practice.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.540
We have a empty DIV with the ID of characters and I've also provided an array of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.080
cartoon character names which I would like you to sort into

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.385
alphabetical order and then store inside of a new array.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.525
There is also a little hint at the top here inside the comments.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:01:00.070
We can you use the dot sort method to sort the array,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.830
then the second part is to use the dot map to loop through

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.955
this new array and add the text of name before each character.

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:10.210
They'll look just like the comments here.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.735
The text of name and then the string of Bugs Bunny from the array,

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:16.970
and then name Duffy Duck,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.710
and so on for each item inside of this array.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.835
Then finally I'll put these values inside of this empty DIV at the top.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:29.030
This is a great chance to reinforce what we've covered so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.420
far but if you are struggling to get this to work don't worry,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.030
we'll cover the solution in the next video.
