00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
In the last video, we created a function which randomly

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.075
selected one of the shapes inside of our array, which is just here.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.075
In this video, we have two main objectives.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:18.045
We want to assign these random shapes to our shape 1 and shape 2 variables.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:23.970
Also, we need to change the shape values every second to update them on the screen.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.480
We know this select random shape function

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.275
down at the bottom is resulting in a random shape.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:34.995
So we can go ahead and assign this to our variables.

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:41.625
First of all, let's say shape 1 is equal to select random shape.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:48.630
The same for shape 2 this can also be select random shape 2.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.704
Now we need to run this select random shape function

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:57.560
every second and update these variables here.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.165
To do this, we can use a JavaScript method called setInterval.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.620
This will run this function or repeat

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.155
the same code with a time delay between each repetition.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:14.785
So let's wrap these two here inside of our set interval method.

00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:18.215
So first let's cut out these two lines here.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.000
Then inside a set interval,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.730
we create the parentheses.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.610
Then inside here, we can run a ES6 arrow function.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.695
So let's create this inside here,

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:32.860
the curly braces, and then we can paste in our two reassignments.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.965
Semicolon at the end here,

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:40.730
and then we can add the time delay outside of these curly braces in milliseconds.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.925
So 1,000 is equal to one second.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.350
So now this function will run every one second,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.205
giving us different values for shape 1 and shaped 2 each time this interval will run.

00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:58.920
First, let's check this is working by logging the values of shape 1 and shaped 2.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.225
So console log, shape 1,

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:05.765
and then a second console log,

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:11.325
this time for shape 2 over to the browser.

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:15.930
Reload. Good. So we keep

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.760
seeing two new objects appearing in the console and they appear to have different values.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.070
So this works great, but we don't want this code to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.710
run until the player hits it's playable at the top.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.125
So first we can surround this timer inside of a function.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.065
So just below set interval,

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.150
let's create our constant,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.414
which is going to be a arrow function,

00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:44.580
and let's call this repeat random shape.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.040
Again, it's going to be an arrow function.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.905
So we'll set this up just like this.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.070
So inside of the body of this function,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.170
we're going to add our set interval.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.455
So let's cuts out the section we created before,

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.210
and then paste this inside of our function.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.160
So now this set interval will only run each time a call repeat random shape,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.620
and we want to do this when a player clicks on the Play button.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.555
So let's add an on click handler to our play button.

00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:23.780
If we go over to our index page and then scroll down to the main section,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.580
here's our play button here,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.940
which has an id of play.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.620
So we can select this with get element by id add

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.835
a click handler to run our repeat random shape function.

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:43.000
Down below this, let's add a comment of start game.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.620
Let's first select our button with get elements by id.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.240
The id was play.onclick.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.050
This is going to run a ES6 arrow function.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.560
Then inside here we can call repeat random shape,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.595
with the parentheses afterwards.

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:10.330
So this will go ahead and run,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.299
save this and then over to the console, reload.

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.715
We don't see anything running just yet.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.345
Now if we click on the play button,

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:23.530
we now see our objects are now generate it.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.350
Good things are now moving on nicely for our game.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.405
However, we want to move the shapes out to the console and display them on the screen,

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:36.090
and this is what we will do in the next video.
