00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.020
We now have a list of songs displaying on the screen,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.515
which is all being pulled in from our API data.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:12.360
At the moment though we're using a static query string, i.e.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.290
We typed into the search term in the URL just at the top here.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.210
This is not what we want to use.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.355
Things will be a lot better if we could type in a search term inside the search bar,

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.440
inside of a web-page.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.080
To do this, let's head over to our

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.655
scripts.jsfFile and first we need to set a variable to store our search term in.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:42.465
Let's go to the top of the page here.

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.870
Make little space, and we use a let,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.910
I call this term.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.410
To begin with, let's set this to be a empty string.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.005
Then next stop let's create a function which is going to be responsible for

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:01.360
updating the search term each time a user types in the input field.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:11.190
Constant update term and this going to be a ES-6 arrow function and Inside

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.970
here we can update this search term Let's update

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.775
a term to be equal to document.getElementByID.

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:25.200
The ID wants to grab is this input from the top.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.895
Let's go down to our search inputs and it has an ID of

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:35.750
search inputs so of course we can use this over in our get element by ID.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.330
Let's add search inputs inside here.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.470
Just like that and then we want to grab the value by using.value.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.830
We're going to go ahead and figure this function very

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.240
soon when the search button just on here is clicked.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.570
But for now we can add an if statement to check if

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.965
the user has actually entered something inside this inputs.

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:03.110
To start with this term,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.850
we can add an if statement.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.155
Let's check if there is no term.

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:17.130
Or the term is equal to an empty string.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.185
The user has not entered anything into the inputs.

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:24.110
We can add an alert with some text saying,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
"Please enter a search term

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.980
o-k." First we are checking if the user has actually entered something.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.060
Then we can add a else statement just after this.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.140
This else statement is going to run once our user has typed in a search term,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.135
will know all the code from below is working and pulling any data which we need.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:54.185
Therefore, we can cut all the way down from our constants of URL.

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:56.270
Let's close all this out,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.525
right down to the very bottom.

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:05.075
Good that with a Command or Control x inside of the curly braces for the else statement,

00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:10.875
paste this in and let's just indebtedness.

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.100
Let's make it little bit smaller and intense,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.020
all the section from four.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.295
Now this is all in, it's on the else section.

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:26.645
This should all run when we type in something in the search bar.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.690
Now all of our faction of the data are

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.185
constructing our articles is now in the else section.

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:37.130
We now have this search term stored in the variable at the top.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.965
We can now pass this into our URL.

00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:44.340
Remove the term or beyonce from here.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.475
We can add our query strings,

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:49.055
which was a $ symbol,

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:53.230
the curly braces and m plus in our term.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.230
For this to work, we need to remove

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.065
these quotations from the start and end and replacing this with back-ticks.

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:04.310
Then finally, to run this function,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.325
we need to add an event listener to the button.

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:12.480
In our index.html, this is the button which is going to trigger our search.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.230
Right down at the bottom of our scripts.js,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:25.245
we can add a constant of search button or search Btn, equal to documents.

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:28.150
Our query selector.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.380
We want to select the button and then we can add an event listener to the Search button.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.570
Search Btn.addeventlistener.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.075
We want the listener for a click event and then we want to run the function at the top,

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:51.110
which is called update Term, which you just here.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.630
Let's pass in update Term as the callback.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.065
I think this should now be everything we need to get things working.

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:03.295
Go to the browser and we can check this out.

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:06.050
Reload and now see our songs have been

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.780
removed because we don't have a search term, anymore.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.195
Let's try adding a search term.

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.475
Let's go for Ed Sheeran.

00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:17.150
Let's search. We seem to have a problem somewhere.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.535
Let's go back over to the code.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:24.450
In fact, let's check the console and

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.905
no arrows inside of there let's take a look so go search button,

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:40.350
which is triggered and update some URL.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.960
In fact, he would just add in the name of the search term,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.715
as we done before we need to add a term is equal and I pass this in,

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:55.350
just like that, give us save then reload and try this once more,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.520
it Search and there we go.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.020
There's our results for Ed Sheeran and let's just try

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:10.100
one more the search and we can see that there is a problem.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.910
We still have the results from Ed Sheeran as before.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.800
But if we scroll down,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.590
right down to the very end of the Ed Sheeran moons,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.375
we can now see that the Queen editions have been added to the end.

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.790
If you search for more than one thing,

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.830
the results are added onto the end of the last results rather than

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.320
replacing what is already there and this is something which will fix in the next video.
