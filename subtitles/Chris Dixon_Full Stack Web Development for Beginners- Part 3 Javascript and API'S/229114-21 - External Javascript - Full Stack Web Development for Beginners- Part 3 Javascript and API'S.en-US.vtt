00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
All there in the JavaScript starter files,

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.935
there's a folder, if you go inside the menu called external JavaScript.

00:00:06.935 --> 00:00:09.795
If you open up this index dot HTML page,

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:13.215
it's the same code which we ended the last video on.

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:17.400
What we'll be doing in this video is taking the JavaScript out of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.960
this HTML file and placing it into its own separate file.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.855
Like what we did earlier with CSS.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.780
First we need to go over to our project folder and create

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.250
a file to add this to with the dot js extension.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.010
Inside of this external JavaScript file,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.870
click on the new file icon,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.000
and we can call this anything we want.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.885
I want to call this scripts dot js.

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:46.695
Then we need to cut the contents of the script for

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:51.005
index dot HTML and then paste it into this new file.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:55.945
Back over to the index and then scroll down to our scripts section.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:00.280
Let's make this a little bit smaller just for now and then if we cut

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.635
all the contents of our scripts leaving in these two tags in place.

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:11.430
Paste this back into our scripts dot js file and give that a save.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.000
Good. The JavaScript is now in its separate file, for things to work.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.855
We still need to link this file in the index page using the source attribute.

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:23.070
Back over to the index.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.760
Let's just move the script tags together.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.925
Then let's go ahead and add the source attributes.

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:34.280
This is going to be a relative path to our scripts dot js file,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.230
the script file, and also this index page are in the same folder level.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.775
We can just simply add scripts dot js.

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:46.145
If we save this and then go to the browser,

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:50.060
reload, and now our code still works.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.295
Each time we move over,

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:57.505
dp elements would now get an updated x and y value for the mouse.

00:01:57.505 --> 00:02:03.845
A lot of the advantages of external JavaScript files is similar to external CSS files.

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:06.110
First, we have the separate HTML,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.800
CSS and JavaScript, making our code more organized, readable, and maintainable.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.975
Also having separate JavaScript in its own file

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:18.395
will enable us to use it in multiple HTML files.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:22.145
If we just leave the JavaScript in the script files as we had before,

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:25.295
it can only be used in this one single file.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:30.410
We can also add multiple JavaScript files to HTML page two

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.615
all we need to do is add more script tags with the source attribute for each file.

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:39.170
Next, we're going to put what we've learned in this section into

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.180
practice by building a calculator to convert pixel values to em.
