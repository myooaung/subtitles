00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.185
Now is your chance to put into practice what we've learned so far in this course.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.910
We are going to be creating a calculator which converts pixel values to be em.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.805
Remember, em is a relative size,

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:17.490
which is based on the parent container.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.260
For example, in pixels,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.784
if the parent container was 20 pixels and we want to detect inside to be 18 pixels,

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:30.995
we can click convert and then when it set the value to be 0.9 em's.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:34.155
Everything which you need to build this calculator,

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:35.920
you've learned so far in this course.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.480
It shouldn't throw up any surprises and if we go over to the starter files,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.744
and if we go over to 20,

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:49.565
which is the pixel to em calculator and if you go to the script.js,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.130
we have the calculation at the top.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.140
To get the em size,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.200
we divide the required pixel size by

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.290
the parent pixel size and this is the conversion you will need to make this work.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.910
Also, if we go over to the index page,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.810
you're already provided all the styles and the mark-up that you'll need to get started.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.690
Everything you need to do will be inside of the JavaScript file.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.995
We can go ahead and focus on adding the JavaScript.

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:19.580
May look a little complex,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.945
but all we need to do,

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.745
is to get this calculation,

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.665
grab the values for all parents,

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:26.630
and also the required size,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.310
and perform this calculation when this button is clicked.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.075
Good luck with this, give this a good go,

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:37.530
and I'll see you in the next video where we'll go through my solution.
