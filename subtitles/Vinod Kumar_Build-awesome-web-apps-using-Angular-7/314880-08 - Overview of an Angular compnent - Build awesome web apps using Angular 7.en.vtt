00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
congruent is the fundamental building block,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.870
often angular application.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.220
It proves the user interface,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.550
corresponding data and even handling functions.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.180
Also,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.140
an angular application can be considered to be a tree of component,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.250
with the root component having one more child components and each of these components

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.250
having child components off its own on so on and so forth.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.340
A competent generally consist off.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.530
Three Aspects number one,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.060
a typescript are year six class with member variables representing the model data and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.730
methods representing the behavior off the component.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.830
Number two,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.940
an HTML template representing the user interface that can capture user inputs into the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.290
model.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.850
Later,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.750
our present,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.370
the model data to the user and finally number three,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.050
an optional state sheet toe enhance the appearance off the user interface.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.800
Let's try to understand the same with an example.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.540
Consider the class at counter component is just an ordinary year.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.130
Six class having a member,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.350
variable car count and two functions increment and equipment.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.070
As the name suggests.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.800
When you call these functions,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.870
the increments are detriment.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.470
The value off the member gator Together,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.830
this class comprises off the company's state and behavior in order to present the same to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.480
the user.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.050
We need an HTML core.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.560
Take a look at this HTML snippet.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.730
As you can see,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.150
we're including the valuable count and the method calls toe agreement and increment.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.390
This hedge demon has access to the competent state and behavior.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.550
The devil Curly brackets,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.510
also known as handlebars,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.890
binds the model data on the U.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.050
N.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.860
Changes to the modern data is reflected immediately.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.780
The confidence functions are bone to the you're using their own.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.450
Brackett's.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.860
For example.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.870
The clicking went off.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.820
The buttons here are associated with agreement and increment functions defined in the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.950
competence class,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.150
so clicking on a button triggers the assigned method.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.420
Call changing the Morgan data,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.620
which will be reflected instantaneously on the you are in order to combine the plus on HTML

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.850
to make a component,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.520
we use types groups,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.350
decorator.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.340
This is similar to Joe's annotations and darkness attributes here.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.650
The plus at counter is decorated with that component.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.790
Decorators in Desperate are passed an object as perimeter for the component decorator.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.150
Here we're specifying two important properties.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.400
First,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.540
the selector defines the way component is used.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.590
For example,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.760
at counter without any prefix to symbol implies that the component should be used like an

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.050
HTML element.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.310
If you use dark at counter for the selector property,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.150
then the component is used as a CSS class.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.650
If you use square record around at counter for the selector property,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.420
then the component is used as an attribute,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.190
often html element and one last.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.200
If you use hash up counter for the selector property and the competent is used as an idea.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.750
Often it's Gmail element.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.270
General practice and angular recommendation is that the components are used like HTML

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.950
elements.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.250
The second property template correspond toe the html part of the component.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.710
As you can see,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.670
we have used year six templates.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.750
String for embedding multilane html core.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.740
Ultimately,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.750
the class definition on HTML can be kept in separate files.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.250
This all those modularity and separation of consents.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.660
For this use the template Ural instead off template property and assigned the related parts

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.470
often external.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.400
Html five
