00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
many attempts we may have to use our 40 child was completely It's like chick.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.890
Well,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.440
for example,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.590
in our application,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.770
when we goto contact list on scrawled on,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.380
you'll see that it is a Lord More button,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.650
which lords the next to batch off 10 contacts.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.320
But if you want this toe automatically,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.780
Lord,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.070
when you scrawl the page here like you might have seen in Facebook where when you scroll

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.460
down,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.350
it loads more page content.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.470
To do so,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.270
we may have to use J Query.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.250
The first step towards this is toe installed G query on its dependency.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.970
So I've been envy.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.270
Um,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.050
installed J quality and its dependency is activated types slash chick quality.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.050
Once served in the installation we have toe let angular know that we have a new JavaScript

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.560
file.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.130
For that,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.250
we go toe angular Jason,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.220
which is right here,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.790
and you can see that if you scroll down there is a section called Script,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.620
which is an area off on the scripts that you want toe associate.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.650
So let's expand this and add an entry.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.270
The injury here gives for J Query,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.630
which is there in the norm,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.350
or tools,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.390
and Scott don't g expand it dist!

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.870
And we have your geek wedded or Js andi with North underscored moderns slash j quarry slash

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.120
just slash check Very dark,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.740
mean torches saved this fight on any changes to your angular Jason will ask for the sun

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.750
will be restarted Let's go back to our survival control See and run this once again.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:59.590
And now we have the application loaded successfully in order to understand how to handle

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.270
the scroll.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.780
Evans off the Jake worry.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.650
That's Goto.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.050
Jake went dark on where J Query has already been loaded.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.090
Andi,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.630
I'm gonna open the developer tools.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.070
Now you can see that dollar is a valid variable which separates their function.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:29.360
Onda Good likened a pure dollar off bodies door depend and you should see that there is a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.400
hello printed.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.460
So which means Jake worry,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.650
it's working here without any problem.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.750
And this is really good and we have access to dollar.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.080
In order to find out the scramblers position,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.950
he can see that this crawler currently is at zero position.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.180
But as and when I scroll down now you can see a part of the pages last,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.470
for example,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.080
up to hear if It's last,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.370
right?

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.590
So it's it's gone up now.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.780
We want to find out what it is called position when you are at the bottom.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.620
So which means that we want to see what is the amount of page that is loaded on the top.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.140
Plus,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.870
what is the height off this section,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.120
which is the window state?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.780
So we can get this information by typing what have you equals?

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.310
$2 window.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.710
So know WT presents the window object and I can take your window door strong top Andi since

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.910
currently we have almost at the bottom.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.780
When I press it is 13 71.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.310
But if you go to the beginning and then call the theme function it zero because I have not

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.340
scrub anything.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.750
So if I bring the page toe this level so by scrawling and now if I say what is this crawled

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.150
job?

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.200
You can see that it is 2 26 big sense on the same way now when I'm here,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:58.980
it said 1371 which is the location off your document in this place so we can also get the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.900
bottom position by adding up the height off the window For example,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.330
if I live w dot height,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.310
it is 6 21 which is the height from this part toe this parts.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.650
If I reduce the windows right toe somewhere on 50% and check,

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.250
you'll see that it is somewhere on TNT and 25 pick says so by adding up,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.180
that's crawled up to the height.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.420
We should be getting the lend off the document so you can see your w dot height plus the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.280
village or scrum top on.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.160
That's supposed to be the height off our window,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.350
which is 1992 big cells.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.380
Now,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.390
this really is based on where is your current scroll position?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.290
So right now,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.440
somewhere I'm in the middle,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.100
you can see that it says 1034.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.600
So if I'm in the beginning,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.280
I should be getting something like 600 to anyone because I'm having this crawled up zero,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.150
and I'm only adding up the w dot height eso 6 21 Big sell.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.020
Now,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.000
if you are at the bottom most,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.020
we know that it is 13 71 but it depends on the content of the page.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.620
The content of the page put together is called Document.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.870
So I can stay here for the Equal stores dollar document on.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.830
And now I can say the lot height and you can say Didot height is 1992 We respect you off

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.090
where I am right now.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.760
So I'm in the beginning right now.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760
Dealer height,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.810
which is the document Height is still 199 toe.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.420
So in order to check if we have scroll to the bottom most we have to compare the blue dot

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.350
height placed of leaders crowd all toe the deed or height.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.610
And if they match,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.250
that means where the water most and we can trigger that Lord more functionality off our

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.640
application here so that when we are at the bottom most,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.540
the Lord more function happens automatically.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.950
So this is the idea behind this.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.150
So let's go back and implement the same thing.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:12.300
So let's go toe SRC ab components contact list on the DS corresponding to the same where we

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.210
already have the lower more function.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.850
We just have to call this again and again based on our criteria.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.400
So the first thing is,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.320
you have to access the global variable dollar which is there in the window and make it a

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.670
local.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.940
Really?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.090
Well,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:33.630
let's just define advanced other people's toe window off the dollar R J quality.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.650
So it's one of the same enough.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.820
Let me give it like this.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.520
I had the dollar.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.950
So now I have to go to the unit and say that we're interested in listening toe the scroll

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.340
event off the window.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340
And to do that,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.870
let's first at your dollar window towards crawl.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.580
So basically,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.450
we're industry in the scroll event on the supply callback function,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.580
which is the event to be fired.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.310
Every dime your scrawling.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.260
So that means that if I'm scrawling the page like this,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.920
they even these fired every time.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.290
What we have to do is to now get the access to the window height and scrounged up,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.720
which means that every time I scroll like this,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.250
they even this fire and that is where we want to write our core.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.300
And I'm gonna create a couple of local variables left w equals toe color.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:35.260
We know Onda let d equals $2 document and we just heard check if w dot height plus a little

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.960
scrum don't equals toe did not hide.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.750
Then we just have to call this start Lord more.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:51.840
See this on notice that this function is also linked to toe important.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.300
Over here we will not be clicking the button anymore.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.120
Eso You can actually commit this line by pressing command,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.650
slash,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.300
control slash save the file on go back to the browser.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.570
So if I scroll down,

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.780
you see that it's not loading all of them.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.230
That's probably because there must be an editor,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.930
and the other says this start Lord Moore is not a function now.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.060
This is a typical off when we're using Jake Worry.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.090
Now there is a reason for this.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.760
Reason is we're using a callback function in a ES fight style,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.150
not in year six time.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:34.360
So in the years five style that key were This does not correspond toe the class member

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.020
variables,

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.690
but instead it represents window object during the execution.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.350
So in order for this cable to represent the class object,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.040
we just have to convert this into an adult function.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.220
So I'm gonna get it off this function and then on Adul and save this.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.060
Let's go back on.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.470
We'll also see the ridge quality learning more and more content.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.020
So just to make sure that we are able to learn more on both that could Then it worked up

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.430
and in the night talked up you'll see that there is one request to the rest.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.690
Endpoint has been made.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:13.590
But if I scroll down here as soon as I scrolled all you should see that it's gonna make

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.120
another request on.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.150
That's for the page.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:22.160
Number two on ice Crown more and you will see that there is a page number three on page

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.330
number four and so on and so forth.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:24.970
So really well,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.710
the Lord this automatically,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.850
just like how applications like Facebook works.
