00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
Now that we have multiple components in our applications that has contact list component

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.330
and contact details component,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.050
we should be able tow switch between them by clicking a particular contact person,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.190
probably on the image or on the name.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.450
If I click on that,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.910
it should display the details off that specific person.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.260
Obviously,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.950
we have to identify where that information should come.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.410
So we would like to probably remove this contact list.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.440
And in that place,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.250
we want to display the contact details of the person.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.950
And this is done by using some concept called routing concepts.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.550
First thing you have to do is tow identify the location where the component has to be

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.760
destroyed dynamically.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.430
Now,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.030
to this end,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
we will go to our ab AB component HTML.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.740
And this is where we displayed components by changing it manually.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.750
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove that and then place a component called rotor outwit.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.190
It's a building component from angular,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.680
but this is gonna come only if you are using something called Wrote of modern.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.120
Since we're not done that.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.740
So it's not helping me out here,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.480
but nonetheless,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.150
let's add that little chocolate as attack.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.020
So obviously,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.940
if you go back to the browser,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.050
you make it better here saying that row total.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.680
It is not a valid component.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.070
If you go back to the console,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.770
you can see it.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.510
Zero To rotate is not unknown.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.670
Element now that can be fixed very quickly by going to our application are at modernity is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.670
,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.430
and we have to adhere a model called a rotor model.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.860
So let's go on ad about our model.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.420
So that's a import.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:47.000
Andi from on your slash road and this is gonna give me a model.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.210
It's at a model called Rotor Modern.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.450
Unlike the previous ones which we used over here,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.340
you may not be able to use this sort of model directly,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.840
and that's because you have to give something called road configuration.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.710
So which is another that's create that right here?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.580
We can shift this elsewhere later,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.260
so we're gonna declare a variable.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.250
That's if Const.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440
Roads,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.020
which is off time called,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.630
wrote it quotes toe and and for the timing,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.760
let's leave it blank and then come down to our import section and then I hear Rotor module

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390
thought for Route on.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.450
Then we supply that roads.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.550
So you saved this.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.830
Now,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.240
if I go back to the Rosa,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.990
I should not be getting an error.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.080
But I do not have any component because we had to dynamically specify that component.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.920
Now the part of the Ural here can identify what this particular component is supposed to be

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.920
.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.960
For example,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.600
if I say slash,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.970
I want the home component to come here.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.200
But if I say yes,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880
slash contact list as an example,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.590
So this part must identify the list of component and that component should be placed over

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.060
here.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.480
We may also say your slash details are contact details.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.560
This should identify a contact intense over here that this is where the road configuration

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.000
comes into.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.840
Picture you to specify what part of the pot should identify work,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.900
component it fairly simple benefit.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.210
Go here and then create a road configuration object which has basically part on We say that

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.880
home is the part and then that should rest Oneto a component called home component on.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.820
Now if your service it will be a blank here at this time.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.490
But once it is very loaded,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.130
we can check here by typing slash hold press enter I should see the home component.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.180
Likewise,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.470
I can also specify that another part called contact list,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.450
should identify a component called as a contact list component.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:15.950
Onda se pot contact details should identify a component called contact details component.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.540
Right?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.590
So now you can see that I have three different road spots,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.370
so each part identifies the specific company.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.720
Now the part that text can be anything that you want,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.300
but I didn't really keep the same thing as the suggestion off the component itself.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.240
So let's go back here on that's whole.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.660
If I say you're contact dash list and press tender,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.250
you can see that it's giving me the contact list.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.860
And of course,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.520
if I said Contract de taste,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.230
it's gonna come back and show me contact natives off a single person.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.550
So obviously,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.830
we also would like to have a root off your application pointing toe some before component,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.670
and that can be done by specifying that the root off your application should redirect toe

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.330
one of this like home.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.110
Our contact lists it's up to you generally redoing in the beginning.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.310
It's not necessary,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.270
but began,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.160
Seyfarth equals toe an empty string and then we specify either component are you can say it

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.650
directly to home in this case,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.370
redirected homeworks because form is a part that corresponds to text.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.350
You can also directly take your component is home confident.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.560
But only one problem is that I'm district is part of every part we want to say the empty

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.560
string should be the only thing in the parts,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.290
not just part of the park.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.300
So that is done by typing for match on the same food this way.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.080
Only if the entire part is an industry,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.150
then it is redirected the home.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.760
So if I go back to the browser,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.440
you should see now that the hole is gonna display by the front.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.260
So even if I do not visit this,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.990
I remove this and press enter,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.660
you'll see that it gets redirected.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.100
Toe slash home on that comes up automatically.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.270
Now that we have got basic routing set up Now,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.850
we also like to provide many options.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.670
So if I click on the menu option,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.570
it should go toe a particular company that this is done by using something called a router

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.680
legs which are simply put hyperlinks.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.720
So let's go and see how that can be done without a couple of menus over here.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.440
One is whole.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.370
One is contact list on off course.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.840
I should be able to switch between them using the hyper means,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.020
not by manually typing it on that spot.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.070
So let's go back toe the cyber component.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.750
Html.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.340
Get it up this H three and on a few buttons here.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.170
So that's forward.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.990
A weapon with Bt and on.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.550
I can save Bt and dash Primary on the button.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.150
Caption will be home.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.460
Let's say this.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.310
Go back on.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.560
You would see that there is a bottom and if you want a wider button,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.810
you can specify year Bt and Dash long that's going to occupy the full ripped off the side.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.960
But which would be nice?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.340
And then,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.790
of course,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.770
I can copy and paste this a couple of times.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.210
A 2nd 1 would be contact list so that that's a list of all contacts.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.700
And if you don't want family,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.360
you can call it that Second Billy.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.470
That's how we look at that,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.000
and this is okay.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.760
So now you see,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.950
I have two buttons,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.710
but of course kidding on which nothing happens so to this end,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.400
what we have to do is to provide what's called as a router link directive.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.400
So they're out telling Directive is given like this I'm endure so that I can have some room

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.150
here so I can say Router League equals.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.680
Do now Remember,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.040
the screen record means whatever that we have given here is an expression.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.820
So this is a regular attribute,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.000
but were given a straightjacket to indicate that this is an expression.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.050
The expression is an Ari consisting off the road.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.080
What So,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.630
for example,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.600
I contest lunch ar slash home on that should correspond toe the home.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.270
Similarly,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.160
I can give you a totally on,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.490
then equals to an expression that consists off contact list.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:09.800
Here,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.840
save it.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.630
And if I go back to the browser,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.710
I should see two buttons on.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.240
When I click on the contact list,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.470
you can see that this rotor Oakland now shows a contact list.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.110
Similarly,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.370
when I take on this,

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.330
you can see I'm able to go back to the home now.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.980
Likewise,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.190
I can also provide a route early for each of these two.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:30.510
Do that.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.370
Let's go back to the contact list.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.320
Html Andi.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.180
If you see,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.800
this is where I have the image.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.110
This is where I have a full name so I can add a route only either.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.990
With this are today that's added toe edge for So when I go to the edge for our a row

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.780
turning equal stoop and Ari.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:59.700
But this time we want to supply slash contact days on save it.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.280
So when we go back here,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.000
we have the contact list.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.780
You see that I don't get a hyperlink are I don't get a culture icon,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.640
but on clicking on this,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.290
you should see that I'm able to put their different person.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.180
Of course,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.240
what we wanted to do is click on a particular person to see the details of that person.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.300
Right now,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.870
we're not supplying any details of the person that we have here.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.940
That is the reason why we're not getting that.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.480
So the next thing that we may have to do is tow wants on the information,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.260
such as an idea off this person to the contact details.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.870
So,

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.100
like,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:33.890
for example,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.380
along with this contract,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.200
it is I might want to supply the seed or idee,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.850
and that's what we can give you.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.660
Come on,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.660
seed on ivy.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.930
So that's the reason why this is an expression.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:44.200
You see,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.550
this is an a day off.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.170
Two values now one is a stream.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.440
That is the part.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.970
And the second is the idea of the person that I am sending.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.410
But unfortunately practical on this,

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.100
you can see that I'm getting an editor.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.160
That's because it's looking at content.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.280
Details slash three on.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.770
I don't have any mapping for this part.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.920
Like we have the mapping for contact.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.470
It is,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.150
but not for contact details slash three.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.590
So if I clear this and take on this person now,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.410
you can see it's giving me another thing.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.600
That context it is slashed.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.930
Five is an invalid one.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.180
So how do we address this?

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.190
It's very simple.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.300
We go to the app model TS and say that what?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.330
Along with the contact evidence,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.550
we also would like to supply an I D.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.800
And if I this type here,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.320
I ve Then it'll assume that ivy must also be hard put it.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.040
But we know that this idea must be like one toe.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.010
Three are so on.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:43.220
So in order to mention that this is a valuable part of the part we give your colon,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.650
Heidi,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.870
and this variable now can identify whatever the numbers that were supplying.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.550
So if you go back again,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.420
you see that there is no other says off?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:52.820
No.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.150
When I click on this,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.240
it is going to the critical person.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.040
But we supply the only five,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.770
but we're not using it over here.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.540
And if you just step back and go to the contract,

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.710
it is component DS.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:10.230
You'll see that we are always supplying 45 as the number.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.080
So even though we're standing here fine,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.740
are one,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.570
for example,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.040
were always sending for a fight.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.670
Now what we have to do is to capture this value we're sending,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.090
which is part of the part for I d Andi.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.370
Then get that I d.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.490
And then work with that.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.580
So instead of sending,

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.270
45 were toe send That idea supplied by the user
