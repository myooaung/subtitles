X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
know that we have seen the template driven forms.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.950
Let's have a look into reactive forms.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.980
Really.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.920
Reforms are based on two angular classes called form,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.150
group and form control,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.760
to understand how this works.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.600
First,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.100
let's add a put in here for a meeting the contact details of the selected person clicking

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.250
on,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.410
which takes me to a form which is preloaded with this particular details.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.290
So first,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.730
let's go on out of water.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:40.900
So we go to the SRC AB component contact details and instead that the HTML currently has a

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.210
delete button that's had another harden.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.550
Before that,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.750
that's a button with Bt and Bt and trash Primary as the class names.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.950
And then it moved has the gumption.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.690
No taking on this should take me to a different screen,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.740
and this can be achieved in two ways.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.620
One is by using it out early on.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.650
The second is programmatically going towards another component.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.860
Let's head out.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.400
To leave.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.800
Rolling is an expression because we give a square bracket here and the expression even

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.650
adding I didn't consist off various parts of the part.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.560
The first part is going to be the slash elite combat,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.360
which is a fixed apart,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.440
followed by the idea off the users on the idea to use that that we wanted it.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.380
Is this Contact our i d.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.850
Let's give contact.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850
Don't I save it?

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.570
But this particular about definition does not exist.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.110
Let's goto our APP Model DS and in the APP model DS.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.680
We have toe define a route for the thing,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840
but we don't have a competent yet,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.020
so let's go on at a component.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.750
So we go to a new tab,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.370
make sure that they are there in the working directory.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.120
We'll have any G generate component.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.950
We want to start in the components folder it it contact is the name of the component.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.650
We don't want death specs at this point today.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.970
And then we also want a prefix car.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.240
PB for whom book This gender is the CSS HTML on DS files corresponding to the component.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.300
Also up,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.650
it's the SRC slash ab slash AP Model DS in the declaration section.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.590
So let's go back to the APP majority.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.110
Yes,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.640
let's add a new route definition for anything.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.150
The contact is a part.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.670
It contact what for a given.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.150
Heidi.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.580
So is a colon idea making this as a variable on the component that we want.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.040
The Lord.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.550
Which is it?

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.930
Contract component.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.520
Save it now.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.390
If you go back to the brother,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.610
you should see that there is an edit button clicking on which it will take me toe.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.250
A new component which is headed Contact works now when this component is loaded,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.160
we would like to get the contact details for the corresponding i d.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.650
On work with that.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.510
So let's go back to the aided component to Yes,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.010
and here first we want toe receive a couple of dependence is number one would be toe get

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.560
the activated route so that we can get that out.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.440
Perimeter second is the form book services through which we can lower the corresponding

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.550
contact details.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:42.450
And it's true that first we said hybrid after redid road off activity throat.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.350
What City girl Private studies Oh,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.310
for others and in the end,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.240
G on it.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.320
Let's do the loading part.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.130
So if they start activity,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.000
develop toward Adams,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.140
which is an observable,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.650
and we subscribe to that by passing a callback,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.540
and the called Reckless is the Baron's Ari.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.550
So the firm's Onda we would like to work with the i D.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:25.770
So we say you're concerned about firms off Heidi Just changes that were ableto access the i

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.110
d from the actress Park.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.630
So we go back to the frozen on.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.250
When this page is loaded,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.440
you should see that it says Got the idea tree.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.850
So which is the idea coming from the road perimeter?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.550
And now that we have the idea,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.380
so we should be able to make a request.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.950
So let's copy this part and get off this,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.810
that they distort service,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.480
start,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.390
get contact leaders off the particular I D,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.490
which returns another observable,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.310
the subscript that by supplying a combat which pursues the contact details that is received

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.710
on.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.940
Then we would like to bring the same thing just a very fine.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.460
Let's go back to the Rosa and see that we get the details corresponding to the I'll be So I

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.860
got the contact list.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.150
I select randomly some other detail,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.080
and then he contended,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.170
and you should see that we get the details of that particular person Now All we have to do

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.150
is tow lured this details into a form that appears over here.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.410
For this,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.640
we will use a reactive forms on the first thing that you have to go for working with the

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:42.120
active forms is going to the APP model DS and import another model from the angular forms

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.440
called reactive forms.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.350
So they have reactive forms model.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.290
This has to be added to the list off imports that we have here because now our model

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.030
depends on another module.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.210
Once this reactive forms model is available,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:06.170
what we can do is we can go here and clear the variable or contact form off life form group

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.220
and we can initial.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.650
Is this in the in it somewhere Here,

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.250
start contact form equals toe new phone group.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.880
The new form group constructor takes some configurations and the configuration is about the

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.150
form element.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.090
For example,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.750
imagine this contact form object represent the entire form.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.480
The form is made about form elements like text boxes And what are the values for each of

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.140
these text boxes we would be interested to mention.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.430
And now we want toe pre Lord this contact details into this form.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.470
So obviously we want tohave one textbooks for each one off them.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:56.470
So we'll have your variables like ivy with a new form control the form.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.460
Control can be an empty constructor or you can also give a default value.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.610
For example,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.430
we leave that as it is,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.650
so you'll see that the I d will be none.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.910
Because we have a form control without any value supplied onto that on the reason we don't

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.910
supply the value here is because at this point in time,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.790
we don't have the actual contact.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.120
The contact is loaded using an observable.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.250
So we have to set the values that form in this particular sections.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.520
We'll do that in a minute,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.300
but first will define off the valuables.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:37.940
Now that we have initialized all the elements off the contact form,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.510
we can also give a D for value to the picture which corresponds to the tea for contact

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.250
profile picture which is there in the contact 50 years.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.180
I have this string.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.400
Some copy this,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.980
and if you go back over here,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.160
the constructor has the first perimeter optional default value which were given here.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.210
Now let's go to the HTML corresponding to the component.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:07.710
Get it off the paragraph Creator form on in the form.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:13.690
We will say that this form should be related to the form variable that were created over

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.090
here,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.480
which is called Contact Form.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.870
And it's very simple.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:25.650
We use a new directive called As form Equals Toe Fund that form in.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.290
Take this.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.310
We can now have extra boxes representing the values off each one of them.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.090
That's good.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:37.040
Do consisting off a label.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.800
It's in first name that input and we'll say you're form controlled.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.250
Name equals two first name.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:52.900
Now you can see that we use a expression here and we simply use an attribute.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.160
This is the syntax now engaged.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.220
If I'm not using a form group and using a form control name directly,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.960
then you can say form control as an expression equals toe.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.110
The first name in this case,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.350
it is assumed as contact form dot First name.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.320
Now this is it.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.830
Now,

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.080
if you compare this with a template driven approach,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.880
we don't have to define a name for this.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.720
We don't have to define engine model.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.920
We don't have to define it.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.800
Employed name with cash.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.290
First name equals strange a model.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.500
So this is why it's much simpler.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.160
Plus it also testable because now everything is optical injured over here including the

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.900
validations,

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.550
which we will see in the next video.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:41.620
We can all put the forms data by using that paragraph,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.930
and we say here,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.550
contact form,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.740
Dark value.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.870
We can put this as chaser.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.380
So that's going verify This nonsense will go back to the browser.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.350
You should know.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.890
See that there is a extra box.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.950
All of these member variables off the form object is none.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:00.700
Well,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.700
if I go here and type some name,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.940
you can see that it appears in this particular form object.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.940
So which means that the extra boxes have bean magically associated with the form object.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.290
So let's go back and add a couple of more elements.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.150
So I'm gonna copy this on based.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.650
This is gonna be for last name,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.850
and we just type your last name.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.180
Save it.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.680
Go back to the browser.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.280
We should see two text boxes on.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.950
I should be able to type in both of them on you can see that I'm able toe reflect the

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.710
changes in the contact form.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.040
Object with this done.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.490
Now,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.210
that's to some beautification.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.830
I'm gonna get it off this.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:47.300
I'm gonna add a class off group on.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.220
This is going to be just a label here.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.360
Amerada Class off form Control.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:01.110
Let's make a copy of the same Andi at another one for last name we would like to see it is

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.010
his last name.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.990
Gender is really wouldn't.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.650
So I'm gonna have a gender as a caption.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.150
This one would be type equals two radio.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.150
If you don't mention the type by default,

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.430
it's gonna be a text want.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.800
Hence,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.090
these are text boxes.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.340
I don't need a class for this,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.710
but I would like to have a name here because gender is really wouldn't read impotence.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.390
In order for them to be working us one group,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.070
you should have a common name there.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:35.520
You also need to say a new equals tool so that the value that you mentioned here will be

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.650
the one that is selected when this radio button is selected.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.750
And of course,

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.150
the name of the form control.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.070
Inside this contract from objective his gender,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.290
I would like to have one more really button on,

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.820
but this is gonna be considered as female.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.960
Of course we would be seeing only toe radio buttons,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.370
but we would like to have some captions for that Onda.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.430
We can address the caption just like this male and female Where one problem is that if you

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.460
click on the world male here,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.070
the reader Britain is not selected.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.850
You might have to pin point and click on that to sell it,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.580
Andi,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.890
instead off that if you want to pick on the label,

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.210
you have to group them as one.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.730
So I'm gonna cut this,

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:27.440
put a labour and based in pregnant the same way I'm gonna cut this for the label on based

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:27.860
in time.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.300
I don't need this far,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.050
so I'm gonna get it off the same.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.760
So now we go back to a browser,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.770
I click on the world female.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.010
You can see that it's selected.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.130
I kick on the world Male.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:43.600
They really wouldn't get selected because the labour also notice that it's bean selected

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.450
over here.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.740
As soon as you click on this street evidence,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.450
you would see that they're badly that also getting changed.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:55.920
So now let's complete the rest of the forms by pretty much copying and pasting each of

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.670
these deals.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:02.810
And finally,

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:11.180
Burton toe save the details that stripe your weapon plus equals to Bt in between primary

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.490
Xavier ST changes on.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.040
We don't need this anymore.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.350
So let's get off this.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.270
Save it.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:25.600
Go back for fresh ones and you can see that the form appears with the deformed picture,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:25.980
Ural,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.270
because that's what is there in the form object.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.700
And the rest of the details don't exist yet.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.380
And if you remember,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:38.110
we are able to successfully do the details off the idea that he s a plate over here on day

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.110
.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.680
Obviously,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.990
we need to know pre load this into the farm on that one step is done like this.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.250
You go back to the place where we were doing the console long.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.240
We can simply think about this.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.650
Start contact formed are set value.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.600
Andi,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.170
once on the actual contact object in the form off key value pairs.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.680
Now you can simply stuff like contact like this.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.110
It has to be a bunch of Keeble appears so to do that,

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.610
we use a year six spread operator.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.750
So we say here we want to create a new object with the values from contact object.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.110
Save it on.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.100
When you go back here,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.450
we should be able to see that the details of the contract is no preloaded.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:26.350
And since we know that by having something in the text box directly affect the form object

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:31.640
we know know that what about the changes we do here is already there in the far object.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.730
All we have to do is tow associate this with day at function which saves the current state

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.250
of the form into our that s standpoint.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.170
Now that's the last part.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:48.690
We will not add a function over here called Save changes and dysfunction.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.260
We will be associating with the please evened up the button.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.740
And when this is card,

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.740
I have to save this starts service.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.450
Which phone books always are updated contact and we have a supply.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:08.430
They start contact for dark value and that value correspond toe an object representing each

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.550
of these keys with the values from the deck boxes.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.300
So let's go here,

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.640
call this function.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.000
We say click event equals to save changes function.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.320
So the same changes function here calls the update contact from,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.870
or phone book saris which returns an observable on.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.490
Let's subscribe to that.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.750
And when the update finishes the job,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.960
it comes back with the updated Dejan.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.550
So we get that in the form of a new contract.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:42.770
And all we have to do is to lure the contact details component for this particular idee.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.860
Andi,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.450
we don't have the rotor dependency yet,

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:52.210
so we're gonna add one more dependency the Savior Private rotor,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.830
off type character.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:00.070
And then we come back here they start out dark.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.120
Navy Gate is a plan a day off parts.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.770
In this case,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.290
it's going to be contact Dash 50 days,

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.480
second bottom.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.250
It'll be the ivy off updated contact object.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.530
So they contact on any.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.550
Save it.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.540
Andi,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.400
If I go back over here,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.600
we'll see that there is a form that is preloaded.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.150
We can go back to contact list.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.560
Take someone else's data click on edit.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.210
The data is Lord Ege.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.470
I'm gonna put couple off hashes Here's on,

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:38.100
then say save changes and you should see now it loaded the contact details component for

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.800
that I d.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.700
And I'll see the changes that have done successfully.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.620
Let's go back.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.180
It is the same thing and save changes,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.260
and we now see that the changes has been updated
