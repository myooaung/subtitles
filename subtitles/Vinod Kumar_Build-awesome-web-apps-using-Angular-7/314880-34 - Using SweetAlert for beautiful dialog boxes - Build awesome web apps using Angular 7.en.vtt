00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
in our application.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.610
When we are viewing the details of the contact person,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.880
we have a patent for delete picking on which you should see that there is a confirmation

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.050
dialog box comes up,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.960
that is,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.750
Are you sure?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
Now the look and feel of days depends on the pros.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.570
Er so if you go to another browser,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.370
for example,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.750
here is a safari,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.010
the same page is loaded and when I click on Village dialog box that appears is totally

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.640
different than the one that we see in chrome.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.450
Likewise,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.980
if I goto five fox and click on Delete,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.530
you'll see that the dialogue box is totally different and this is opera.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.650
And in opera,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.350
the dialogue boxes told You're different.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.460
Of course you can test out in other brothers on.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.390
I'm sure that it's gonna be different to this is not a good approach because we don't have

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.050
the control on styling off this bailout botch.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
Sometimes it is important that we we control these things like for example,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.830
I want to say Ari sure s are no on.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.100
May be I want to have a customer's captions for these now.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.250
Since this is all not possible,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.170
we have to depend on some third party dialogue boxes.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.750
There are many J query dialogue boxes available,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100
but the one I'm showing here is called Sweet Alert.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.560
Safer Goto Sweet.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.080
Others Here is a nice Taylor bunch with animated icons.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.950
They're the nice title.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.570
There's a text.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.710
We can also have some customized apartments like Cancel Estimated.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.810
So to get started with this,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.630
it's very simple.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.220
You just say NPM install sweet alert that future function called Swan.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.460
And then you have very tees off options like we can say,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.760
What is the title?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.030
What is the next,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090
what kind of icon you want.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.460
And if you want to see how this looks like,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.260
you can click on this and see this is how it's gonna look like.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.220
Of course,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.620
you can probably changes to success.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.150
You would get a success button.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.130
There is a documentation also available here at the bottom on.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.650
That gives you a customization off the scene.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.430
Well,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.460
I would not be going.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.950
Indeed,

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.050
in about all the documentation off days,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.450
we would definitely be looking at some of the required options for us.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.720
For example,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.250
when I took on this,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.870
I want to ask a question instead of local host for two double zero safe.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.780
I want to say you're about to delete this contact.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.850
Are you sure?

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.570
Maybe I can say no on.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.780
Then I can say here.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.580
Yes,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.330
on.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.450
I can see that.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.160
Yes,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.640
I'm sure.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.140
But that's not the default button.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.600
And cancel would be the de for Britain because accidental.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.800
If you press ender,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.000
it should not be deleting that record.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.540
So to do that school of the command front opened a new town,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.080
make sure that getting the working directory and will say NPM I for install sweet avert.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.090
So once the installation is done,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.860
we have to tell our application that there is a new JavaScript and that is done by going

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.290
toe.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.090
Angular,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.040
dark Chaisson.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.550
We have a script section we have specifying that there is a new file under normal use.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.320
Sweet alert dissed and you see that they're they're sweet color dot mindo chase.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.960
That is what we have to specify.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.550
So it's cool here,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:36.030
found nor underscore models slash ST alert slash dist street alone dot chase.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.130
Please note that the sweet alert liberally depends on G query and make sure that it is

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.450
included before the street alert library itself.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.900
So save this.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.760
Changes to angular Jason requires the seller to be restarted.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.180
So I'm gonna go to the server,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.490
stop this r word and started one small.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.700
When that starting,

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.100
let's go to our corn where we have the contact details.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.970
So SRC ab components contact details.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.430
Now this is the place where we are doing a confirmation just to test how this world's lets

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.500
out of the function called best Swan.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Andi.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.850
We'll come back and replace this one with the sweet alert core.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.510
But for the time being looked at this one here Now the swell is a function which is

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.730
globally available,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.420
but that is only available in the browser.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.200
So right now,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.820
because we're in the typescript,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.910
we still have no access that from the window scope.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.730
So in order for us to use this well,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.950
let's go on declare a variable called const swell people's toe window off.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:53.530
So when this is a global variable ordered because of the street alert,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.810
this can be anything because it's a local variable toe our model.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.120
So now I can use that over here.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.370
But just start with that swelled and say hello.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.650
Since we don't have a button toe,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.980
call this function.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.740
Let's go to the HTML corresponding today's on,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.930
then call the testes.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.190
Well,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.570
I'm just gonna add a button a paragraph important dot treaty in Bt and default on.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.350
Then I'm gonna are your test suite alert.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:30.750
We need to say click event equals toe best swell function.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.800
So we go back to the closer Here we have a just too sweet alert before important kicking on

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.700
which you should see that there is a nice dialog box that comes up.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.510
Good thing is now this is the same style that appears even in other roses.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.150
Also.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.870
For example,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.710
if I reload this page and click on the master suite alert,

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.680
you can see that the dialog box comes in the exact same state as in Crume so we can test or

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.610
in other process.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.340
Also,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.450
this is opera so you can see that it gets sir reloaded.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.280
You know,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.090
when I click on this tests read alert,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.240
exact same dialog box comes up.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.530
So let's get off this on.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.600
Go back to our court and we'll add some more options than the command is and then I say,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.630
Here's Slab.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:25.450
I can specify a title saying that phone book and I can say hello,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.850
friend.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.250
And then I can specify that this is a success.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.350
Save it now.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.310
When you go back,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.350
it reloads.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.440
Let's click on the test Street Alert partner,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.920
and you'll see that there is a animated icon for success.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.160
This is the fatal.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.090
This is the extra,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.240
and there is an old Caperton by default.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.250
But if you want to change this part and you can change that if you want,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.610
you can click elsewhere.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.910
Toe,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.170
get it off this dial a box also,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.660
which is equal and of cancer.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.100
If you have a confirmation that much,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.560
let's go back instead of success,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.080
you can say warming.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.810
Our info are other.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.580
These are the four options which is documented in here.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.500
We go to the sweet alert documentation.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.960
You can see that there are icons warning,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.090
error success in,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.300
for these are the four different possibilities.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.250
So since I selected Warning,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.390
you should see no a warning icon with the same title and text.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.870
So click on OK to come out of the same thing now.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:34.720
We can also specify these in usually like this swell with the configuration Object on the

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.150
con figuration object may have something like title I can say phone book Uh,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.050
I can specify.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.200
I pon is say,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.990
for example,

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.780
in four I can say your text,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.180
which is the second partier,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:57.070
whatever that given so that text can be like you are in the contact details.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.010
Save it on.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:08.850
Go back on the application reloads kick on this test to sweet alert and we see it similar

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:14.040
dialogue box that's coming up so we can also have confirmation dialog boxes.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.180
And that's exactly what we want to do in case of delayed.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.750
So for the time being,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.940
I don't need this anymore.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.080
Someone who get it off this save it.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.790
Remove this particular button soon.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:33.240
This come back to my core on This is where I want to specify what to do Now.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.910
When the confirmation ballot boxes displayed,

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.690
we will have to burdens and we can define the value for that particular buttons.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.290
For example,

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.620
the first wouldn't maybe truth.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.190
Second button,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.900
maybe falls or it can be 1234 etcetera.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.620
When you call this malfunction,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.560
it returns that promise Onda,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.550
we have to call this delete contact function.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.130
When the promises result,

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.230
we will not have this anymore.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.230
We're gonna say here,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.050
Suad,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.200
on some configuration object And we say when there is a war,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.990
we get the value off the button.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.290
That's qualities result on Then,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.440
using that result,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.050
we say if the result equals toe truth,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.010
then we would like to do this part.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.460
Someone cut this and paste over here.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.920
So basically,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.670
we now get the promise.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.570
When the promises result,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.000
we check what button was clicked.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.580
Was it the true Burton or false button?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.850
If the false button we're not doing anything,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.950
maybe you can simply say that the record is not deleted,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.300
but otherwise this is what we want to do.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.810
And the configuration now can have something like title.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:45.320
We can say you are a vote to delete this conflict.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.410
Next will be placed on from on.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.860
Then I can say importance,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.330
which is an ari on the first button,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.740
is supposed to be like,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.150
Yes,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.350
I want to delete this.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.850
So this will not be the D For only the last button will be the default,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.650
so I can specify the next off the button happens to be like,

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.750
Yes,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.330
I am sure Andi,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.200
Then if you're staying visible,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.110
is true.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.600
Value is also true.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.700
So this is the one that we are actually getting as a result value here once I get the

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.470
result value as true Sarette trying to delete this.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.450
Likewise,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.680
I'm also going to give you another one,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:35.160
which is a fetched you can say cancel on and visible truth,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.830
which is not required for the second button and then value East Falls.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.090
So when you click on the second button,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.990
it's as if you're clicked on the cancel button and the result is false.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.850
Hence this condition is ignored and the record is not deleted.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.750
Dialogue box quits anyways,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.820
so let's save this.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.750
Go back for Rosa on there is a delete button.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.230
Let's click the delete button.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.020
It's gonna say you're about to delete this contact,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.280
please.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.140
Confirm s.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.590
I'm sure canceled.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.320
Canceling will simply remove the Della box and you will be staying back here.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.330
But if I click on delete and say yes,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.580
I'm sure the actual action which is deleting the contact will take place.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.810
And after the leading,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.690
we're no longer going to be in this space,

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.530
but it will take it to the contact list on you can see that it's been deleted now.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.680
So let's go back toe.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.840
One more contact.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.120
When I said village,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.890
I might want to specify that it's a warning or an error.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.980
Warning would be better.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.620
So I can say here that along with the title text importance,

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.300
I can also say Icon is warning on.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.170
Put a comma.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.010
Save this.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.280
Go back on.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.910
If I kick on the delete button now you'll see that there is a warning.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.460
You're about to delete this Contact police Confirm?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.110
Yes,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.860
I'm sure.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.070
Cancel Cancel Reading Village.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:55.480
Yes.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.550
Am sure will delete the record.
