00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
know that we have understood the basics of components.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.080
Andi even binding on a bit off data binding.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.250
Let's build an application on understand more about the same.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.700
So the application is gonna be a phone book application,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.840
which is going to have the absolute component comprising off other components so you can

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.150
consider a proved to be a parent component.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.150
Header sidebar on home to be child components off aboot.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.730
We're also gonna have ah,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.930
routing enabled after a while where the cyber will display a few many options and taking on

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.710
which you should be able to see a different component in place of home component,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.750
for example,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.960
to display the details of the contact so I may have incompetent are probably toe edit or

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.100
add a new component.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.550
I may have a contact form.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.530
If you want to have a list off all the contacts you have,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.560
you may have one more company.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.200
Are if the user is typing something on the address bar and the pages not phone.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.840
We may even want to display an other bitch,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.550
which is generally called it a fortnight four page.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.640
Now,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.930
in order to save some time,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.440
I have already created a basic angular project on and I have already started to serval at

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.250
local host for two double zero.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.650
I have already added bootstrap Ford,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.760
Artur at one.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.340
Andi.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.980
I also added that in our angular Chaisson to start with that,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.220
create the components that is necessary for our application.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.810
So I'm going to go into a mind front and make sure that I'm there in the working directly.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.830
That's my phone,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.060
but APP directory and I'm gonna take this command NGC engine generate component and I want

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.870
the component to be in sub border card components.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.780
This is for organising our files in proper style.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.250
Then I want to create something called Header that's going to be the head of component.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.480
Andi,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.650
I can say I don't want this test cases.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.690
I can say that respect equals two farms as well as I can hear it custom to fix something

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.350
like BB for phone book.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.500
So otherwise,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.080
by default,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.440
it's gonna take at.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.140
So this is gonna create three fights a CSS file.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.410
A hedge trimmer file on a text file also has updated the app model.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.300
Dirty s fine.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.470
So let's have one more.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.400
So this time I mean,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.990
it was an up arrow toe.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.030
Go back to the previous command and I'm gonna call this as sidebar one more competent at

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.530
this time for home and it's gonna have a look at what is being generated.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.570
Notes that may get it up.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.400
All these fights.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.590
So under SRC,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.500
we have AB.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.450
Now you'll see that there is a components border with header home and cyber folders.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.440
Each one of them comes with the three fights.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.960
As we have seen eso there is a CSS html DS.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.810
If you look at the HTML,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.950
it says your header works.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.110
Similarly,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.600
it's his homework on then Sidebar works,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.940
right?

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.120
So that's a very basic output that it's gonna produce.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.320
So we're gonna go to the APP component edged Yemen,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.350
get it off all these things and then I head outside birth as well as the home company.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.020
But while doing so,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.350
let's also make sure that we're gonna structure is just like the babys are in this light.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:47.810
So first I'm gonna add a deal with a role as a class me on that consists off and so you can

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.020
just control space and then you can get that are auto generated,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.980
its team all poor.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.840
And this is where we're gonna have something like PB dash header onda slash Phoebe,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.350
not Heather.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.040
Not even though I'm not gonna have any child component our child content here.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.480
It is important that we give the ending tag specifically like this,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.660
not by terminating with an empty tax time.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.620
Then I'm gonna have another do our role.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.220
So I'll say here typically do roll on.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.430
This time I'm gonna have to columns so you can stay here until the call Times two.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.740
And when you press enter,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.700
you can see that we're gonna get two columns.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.190
Now,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.610
these two columns will be off equal size.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.690
And if you don't want them to be equal size,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.670
then you have toe come up with what is the device that you're gonna target on?

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.050
So that's Emily used small devices that includes something like tablets.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.910
Then you have to specify what is the number off groups that you want out of 12.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.590
So the entire world is considered us too well.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.380
For example,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.240
if you see this visual studio core side but is approximately occupying,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.040
you can say three our four great.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.570
So I can give three.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.200
Then the next one would be sn remaining nine out of 12.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.510
So this would would be nine.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.040
And that's how it's gonna look like.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.950
So if you give this as for then this exceeds 12.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.800
So I think it's not gonna come properly,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.330
so you have to give it as eight.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.020
So this is fine on inside this.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.670
We're gonna provide a PB dash sale,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.910
but on inside this really color BB stash.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:45.320
So it is also important that you may want to specify this inside a column,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.480
So I'm gonna go provide that answer.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.940
Understate dark fun on that.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.730
Put this to after this.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.240
You can rest aren't shift F two former years html cool.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.390
Save it.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.640
And when you save it and go back to the browser,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.210
we should see Heather works CyberWorks on homeworks.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.960
It's the components have been laid out in that particular fashion.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.770
So let's go at some CSS toe,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.930
each one of them the header cyber and home.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.510
And just to show you how this would look like so it's gonna add some collapse over here.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:29.290
So I'm not gonna do forbid on alert alert in four is gonna be a light blue background and

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.250
there are going to say you're each one s o the 100 would be like a phone book application.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.310
Onda.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.410
Let's have a paragraph to say that it's polar fine angry Lord seven.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.120
Save it and he should be not seeing it.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.620
In a minute you'll see that there is a header and of course I can provide a sidebar and

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.140
home with different colors.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.550
It's going a cyber.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.180
So we have the sidebar html right here on.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.880
I don't have any options right now.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.750
We are so I can to stay pure alert.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:12.450
Others Onda Let's just give warning and that's gonna be a yellowish color That's out.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.350
I hit three and we'll Xavier made me.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:22.340
And probably that said So that's going to check it out,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.580
how it's gonna look like.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.460
So this is how the main minute off,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.030
cause you can see that there is a cat Onda.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.480
Uh,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.030
this is also not growing because we don't have much options on Anyway,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.640
we're gonna get it up.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.100
This color will be changed the color,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.920
so it will not make much of a difference.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.890
But if you really want to provide this to be a full height.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.040
Then you can add it s time to this manually on you can create,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.230
for example,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.550
at custom CSS class or as they're full height.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.770
Obviously,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.900
that doesn't exist,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.290
right?

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.040
So full height doesn't exist.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:04.000
So I cannot define my own CSS car full height in the theaters corresponding to this So I

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.420
can start with dark people.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.130
It's in CSS class on.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.240
I'm gonna provide your height.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.940
Or rather,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.720
I can say,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.240
min height 400 pixels are 600 whatever that makes sense.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.350
So we know how their menu that's gonna go into almost full light.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.790
Well,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.830
that's not really important.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.560
So I just wanted to show you how to use a CSS in a component.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.190
So we have that right here.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:30.840
Of course,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.180
we're gonna just remove this and add some many or items over there as we go forward.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.530
One last thing I want to show you here is the home component.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.160
Html.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.100
The whole component is just supposed to mention that this is an angular application

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.860
developed by your name,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.610
for example,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.940
on a few details about that.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.360
So if you have some image,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.130
for example,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.720
you can copy some image and then place that right thing.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.520
But how do we do that?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.490
Let's go and try.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.440
So users do once again on the inside.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.650
This do we're gonna Let's a hedge.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.690
Probably three or two on there,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.350
are they?

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.870
Well,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:18.240
you can say on and awesome Angular seven application,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.370
I say here,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.030
paragraph.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.800
So that left by its a B note tomorrow.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.640
And then,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.290
of course I wanted he made here,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.370
so I can take her.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.880
I am g SRC equals to when you say SRC equals toe.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.610
Where do you want to get the images?

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:35.900
Phone?

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:42.280
So I can start by saying slash a sex if you know thought the G Andi,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.070
Let's assume I want to do some CSS class names.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.450
Class equals toe high energy.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.460
Andi,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.050
this should give me an image.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.130
No,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.540
but I don't have this image,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.440
so it's not gonna come up.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.090
It's just going to give me a broken image option here.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.250
Now toe act this image.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.980
So what I do is I have to basically come back to my SRC assets.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.790
Probably.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.890
That's give a images as one sub folder here.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:17.210
So we want to create a folder called Assets slash Images we already have assets you're

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.870
gonna have on images for the on.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.850
I'm gonna copy of Fine from my local file system to this folder.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.600
So I'll copy that file here.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.530
Corvino Tart,

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.160
J p.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.480
G.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.670
So I have to change the extension from p and G toe jpg and save this.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.740
And when I come back,

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.150
toe my application an urgency that the image is that,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.490
of course,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:38.710
it's,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.150
ah,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.990
a bit bigger image.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.050
So if you want out style directly,

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.160
it is possible,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.770
For example,

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.990
I can say height off.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.680
Probably.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.070
I can say 100 pixel and not more than that.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.110
And you should see No,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.240
it's gonna be a smaller picture,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.640
which makes it better.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.560
All right,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.800
so this is the initial part of our application.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.190
Then everyone provided different components toe work with our phone book application.
