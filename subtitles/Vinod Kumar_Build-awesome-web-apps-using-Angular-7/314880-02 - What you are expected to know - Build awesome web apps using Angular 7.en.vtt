00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Since angular is used for creating Web applications,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.050
HTML becomes the number one prerequisite to do this course.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.110
You don't need to be a master in the topic,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.160
but you should be aware off some of the basic It's team attacks for creating headings.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.670
Dusan Spans ordered another lists,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.200
inserting images and hyperlinks.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.250
I haven't used much of CSS in this course,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.240
but having a good idea off CSS helps you develop nice Web applications for styling.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.370
Our Web applications generally reuse some good CSS frameworks,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.650
and in this course I have used Twitter bootstrap CIA system work.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.290
If you have an idea about the same,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.540
it's fantastic.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.150
But I'm not expecting you to know about it.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.250
Wherever I am using bootstrap,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.270
I'm going to explain what those CSS classes to.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.750
While HTML and CSS make up the presentation layer of whole Web applications,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.850
the engine part of the application is return using typescript.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.140
For all practical purposes,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.410
we can consider typescript to be an extension of Charles Bridge,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.550
so if you have a basic knowledge of javascript,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.850
you're good to go.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.070
The key features,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.150
like Adam functions and decorators will be explained as we go
