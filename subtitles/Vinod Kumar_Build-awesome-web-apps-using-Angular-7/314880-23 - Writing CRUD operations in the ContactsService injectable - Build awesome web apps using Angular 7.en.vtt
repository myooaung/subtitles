00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
in this model.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.990
Let's add more functionalities to our phone book salaries to begin with.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.670
First,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.850
let us change the return type from observable off any toe observable off contact.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.370
And this is because in our component,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.210
contact details contacted its component DS were actually designing the return value off the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.050
subscription to our contact object.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.750
So whereas here we said that it is any we know that when we make a request to this

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.800
particular Ural,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.270
it returns a single contact object.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.970
So let's change this to observable off contact.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.910
Now.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.950
When we saved this,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.250
you can see that it's giving me another because by default the get function returns and

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.260
observable off object,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.800
we have to transform the response object into a contact object.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.590
This is done by calling a function called map whose job is to map on object of one type to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.460
another day.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.670
So to this end,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.700
you may have to call the function car map on,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.790
as you can see that it's not listing out the map function,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.030
so our tuxes has radius operators that you can use.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.780
For example,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.720
if I goto nor models Onda look for audits Js You can see that there is a sub module

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.060
operator,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.170
and there is a plenty of operators that we can see here like,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.760
for example,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.850
conquered or catch.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.660
There is count,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.030
and many of them.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.520
One of them happens to be a map also,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.960
So if you want,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.950
you can import our exterior slash r slash operative slash man.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.050
No.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.650
Again,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.420
access this map function from this get functions.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.070
Return belly.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.240
We continue north Talk man,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.340
and then Matt has access to the response object.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.410
Let's call if estate up and we need to written a converted or map the value from the leader

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.410
.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.510
I can simply sit.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.530
Data has contact,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.650
so the casting off that will take place automatically.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.920
Now you see that there is no other now for this to work,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.680
you have to add one more package to your application.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.310
So by running this command,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.050
NPM install optics JIA's dash compact.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.210
That's a this and go back to the closer to see that the result is intact.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.600
DNA.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.190
It's at a second function.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.010
At this time.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.820
We want to be ableto add a new contract,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.910
so that's color function called as our new content,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.550
and the argument would be object off contact.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.330
After adding a new contact through the http dot post,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.720
we get an observable off the contact object with the 90 as well.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.760
So we're gonna say you're observable off on that and then I can see your return.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.150
This start gets to depict are caused now The Post Rick Waas,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.840
The Ural Very one post which is this base.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.380
Ural,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.670
execute that base yard and there is no idea.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.290
Associative,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.780
unlike the previous one on the second perimeter,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.980
would be the data that you want to our which is this and not that we are receiving a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.430
JavaScript object,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.380
but that will be converted into a Jason payload and will be sent so we don't have to do any

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.940
conversion from object to string here.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.330
It'll also hard,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:38.780
and it's to DP request Header Caldas content ID equals toe applications left Jason So

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.810
everything is implicit.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.090
But if you want to our additional headers,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.460
you can always add it as 1/3 perimeter.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.760
So I don't have any such requirement right now,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.630
But when we do attend occassion,

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.560
then we might have to send some authorization at us.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.950
So at this time,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.610
this returns an observable off objects So,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.980
just like in the previous case,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.310
we may have to match the response,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.170
whatever that is.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.810
Once we get into contact,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.750
object and that's going to be done.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.020
As you can see,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.750
that are pretty much one Venice.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.190
Likewise,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.200
we might want to do an update.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.150
So to do that,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.410
it's called it is off the contact.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.060
We received a contact as a perimeter,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.490
and the return value is just like the previous one.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.230
We have an observable off conduct,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.540
so we're gonna copy face the same thing on this time they return.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.200
They start Http,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.270
tar put which actually,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.610
since then it's city people request this time.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.750
Don't we need the base urine?

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.490
Must the idea of the person who stated that we want to modify,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.750
which is contact our i d.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.150
And then I can say the contact often itself with the paler.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.120
So as in the previous case,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.140
we may still have to map the response to a contact object which we're gonna do now and the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.000
function is done.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.570
Another function that we want Robert here Is that delete which is identical.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.590
So the get so I copy bears the same change.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.950
The name toe delete contact.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.990
It seems the ideas a perimeter on because the http dot delete function.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.220
Andi,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.220
Unlike the previous ones,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.180
there is no contact update coming at the restaurant.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.850
So this is gonna be observable off any,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.760
and then I don't have a requirement off mapping this.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.340
Let's have one more function to this service class,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.850
which gives me a list of conduct by page.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.470
So,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.640
well,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.230
addio get all contacts,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.450
which takes a page number,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.350
which is a number on if the number was not so Let's take it to the first page,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.750
which returns and observable.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.810
But this time,

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.130
instead of a single contact,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.450
we will be having an array off contact.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.810
And in order to make a request,

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.810
we can simply say,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.730
returned this stuff extensively.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.240
Don't get base Yoran on.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.770
But then we say your dot map,

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.460
we get the response and we convert the response in tow on array,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.540
off contact.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.070
Now,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.220
this will give me all the contacts in our resting point on.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.250
We want to make use of this page number.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.490
To do that we can read available for parents Andi,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.850
which is an object consisting off key values.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.780
The key is a string car Underscore Page and the value must always be a string,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.470
which is the page number that we're supplying.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.710
So we're gonna just convert that into a string.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.730
But concatenation and this pattern can be our second argument.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.880
Now the second argument to that get is a bunch of options,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.100
like headers and perimeters and so on.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.540
And since we want to supply only the pattern meters,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.150
so we'll save your career bracket parents.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.860
Now this is as good as saying parents is the key.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.870
Colon bottoms is the value now in Year six.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.740
If you have the key and value with same variable names,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.870
you can just type parents.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.350
So let's save this on that sour get all contact by page function.
