00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.650
let's take examples off creating new components using the angular CLI or the Engy Command

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.180
onto the monster.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.900
The working of components I have already created a brand new angular project called Counter

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.480
at a Zoo Conceit Salary run in years,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.140
so welcome to contract and has got the basic links here already opened the same thing in

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.450
visual studio core.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.570
This is a brand new application.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.680
Nothing has changed except that I've added bootstrap CS is to this one.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.340
Other than that,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.610
there is nothing that so we do have here at SERC app and we have your app component of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.470
tears which has got this title.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.530
We can change that any time we have the html corresponding to the same thing which has gone

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.350
on this stuff.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.660
We will get it all these things and our own header footer on another component for counter

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.410
application.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.070
And then there,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.730
the CIA says,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.850
I'll show you how this year says can affect our view as well.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.030
No,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.900
of course,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.930
we do not want toe change anything at this time,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.510
but we want to add a new components toe our application now,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.940
remember,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.100
every time we added a new component,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.900
it has to be registered with our engine modules,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.760
which is there in at modern ideas.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.310
Right now,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460
there's the only component,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.120
as you can see that component.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.570
Now,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.810
I'm gonna create another component here,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.140
and this is going to be called Let a app header on at footer on golf course the counter

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.850
component.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.440
Now,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.960
to create these new components,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.740
I have to goto a command front,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.250
which is terminal here.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.660
Now.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.060
I can stop this.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.040
I don't need to stop,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.720
but I can.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.530
But on Mac,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.780
I can open a new tab on by present command t on.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.560
Then I have a new command prompt here.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560
So my star is still running here.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620
But I have another tap that is open,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.070
which is in the same location.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.660
I said you can see that I'm in the counter app here now to create a new company,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.800
you can use the command n g generate on,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.050
then save component.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.950
Now,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.320
of course,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440
we have a shorter brilliant out the same thing.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.860
You can simply say n g g c g for gender,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.970
t for components and then you need to give the name of the component you want to create.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.540
Suppose If I wanna create head a component,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.550
then you just start to type.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.280
Header are if its app header give capita Now I can say for example Rapido But what happens

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.810
is it's gonna create everything in this location making this a bigger fight.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.200
So what?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.620
We can organise them as a four that I consider components slash.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.210
So it's going to clear the new for liquor components and intact that I can say that it's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.250
supposed to create me a dash header component.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.020
Now it will also add a perfect off app dash for every selector in this demonstration.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.930
I believe that as it is and I pressed Enter Onda later.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.600
I'm also going to say I don't want any prefix because anyway,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.150
I have given your app Dash other is gonna create ABX dash abduction as the perfect.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.550
We'll see that in a minute.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.140
Come on a press Enter Italy gendered four different files The files comprises off a CSS and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.960
HTML,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.950
a Esther Spectacor and then your actual component court.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.580
Now,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.790
if you don't want respect,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.630
for example,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.200
you can always say cash respect equals two funds.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.610
You don't get this file it up.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.720
You can also verify that the file after model tortillas has been updated with you can see

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.830
that it has added after their component to our applications.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.250
That's really need,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.480
because otherwise I have to keep track of adding each one up there.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.030
Now if I go there if I control click this particular fight on DSI.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.930
What is there in that?

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.430
You can see that it has added a perfect AB dash to our application,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.420
which doesn't look nice.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.340
I'm gonna remove that.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.510
I'm gonna leave it us at header on golf course.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.810
That's just a header over here.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.210
So there's nothing in this,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:08.290
and it's only a new company announced on your return date here on NGC on this time,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.810
it's a component slash footer.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.710
Angular has a few recommendations as how the naming convention should be followed.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.340
So they say use a perfect so it is not going toe collide with any of the building.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
HTML tags are some other frameworks stack,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.800
so it's always better to specify your free mood specific Perfect.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.890
Over here on this time out,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.650
so say that's just spec equals two falls that's just prefix equals to an empty string.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.420
If you don't give an empty string.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.540
Then,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.810
of course,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.290
it's going to take up cash.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.320
So this time you'll see that there are only three felt that get generated.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.080
Andi,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.560
there is update,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.090
of course,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.020
in the model DS on.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.480
Also,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.980
just to make sure that we have got the generator,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.220
you can see the app footer the component.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.700
If you look at the component to ts you see that it is now need.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.070
It's not ab Dash and Dash would just abduct shooter.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.450
So let's have one more component.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.980
And this time I'm gonna just you than a paddle on.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.130
Then I'm gonna say,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.050
uh,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.330
counter.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.520
And then,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.000
of course,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.520
we have a counter component as well.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.010
So in already used them.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.860
This is the selector that has to be used.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.320
So I have your a counter header at footer.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.020
So I go to the at Don't component html,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.590
get it off everything here and then I can say here I headed You can see it's gonna help me

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.450
with this.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:51.690
I heard it and then I can say act ash counter slash counter off course a footer slash

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.020
footer as another service and go back to the browser.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.970
I should see that the three components placed there,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.760
but all it does it,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.510
it is apt.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.800
Header works at counter works up foot or works.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.610
Of course,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.230
we This is an auto generated court for every component.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.490
Look at that components slash up header.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.780
There is the HTML part of it,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.100
and it Simples is up.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.110
Heather words.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.420
You know,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.400
we can get it off this and then put it it on.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.460
Probably inside that I can say h one.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.120
Welcome to the colander,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.330
Andi.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.870
I can add a CSS class name here by saying something like Alert honor,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.310
Dash in four separate Onda.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.730
We should see a beautiful header off course in the Footer works.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.120
Let's have a basic copyright kind of information.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.870
So let's go with a footer for the HTML.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.870
I'm going to get it off this app for their works.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.320
Of course,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.550
we can say be extra center.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.830
That's like the extra center line.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.410
And then,

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.420
of course I can see here that all rights why,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.320
that's a https.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.680
We know that on this ender that's gonna be the food are supposed to be a sender lined.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.450
Andi begin sits there now,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.000
of course,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.500
the counter at counter works.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.850
And that's what I believe you want to create
