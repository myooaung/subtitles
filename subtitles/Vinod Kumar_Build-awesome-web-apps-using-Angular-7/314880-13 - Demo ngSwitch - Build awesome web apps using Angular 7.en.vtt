00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's work on another example to understand Engy,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.240
Switch and Ng's which case.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.980
So first I go toe the line front gender,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.650
a new component called N g Storage.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.140
And since we want to see this on or quote screen,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.570
will goto SRC up at component HTML and we want to include the newly generated Engy switch

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.290
them also,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:35.120
I will commit this on behavior after sh n g switched him as a dyer.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.250
Save it.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.160
Let's go back to the problems er on dsi that it says Engy switch demo works.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.730
So which means our newly red component is available here.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.550
Let's go to the HTML off the new component.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.250
Get it off this That's at a history will say Engy switch.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.330
Don't that are four buttons,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.900
porton dot feet,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.090
Ian Thorpe et and Primary.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.380
We want four off them and then we want to have a caption button dollar that you that's put

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.610
in one button toe.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.310
It's a draft,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.850
so we have four buttons.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.360
We'll also are four deals corresponding toe each one of them.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.560
So I'm gonna have here.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.270
That's it.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.020
This is Dave number dollar,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.750
and I'm gonna get four days just like that.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.550
Let's assume that each of these deals correspond to each of the buttons.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.380
When I click on the button one I want this to to be with visible on when I kick on the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.100
button to only you two should appear on when I click on the tree.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.450
Only did three should appear and so on.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.420
Now for this to work,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.410
let's go to the years corresponding.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.050
Today's declare a variable called choice on Let's give a default value off 12 the same.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.390
We read a function called SEC Choice,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.940
which receives a choice and then assigns toe distort charge.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.050
Save it.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.840
Let's go back over here,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.830
Andi,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.430
we'll call that function through this one.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:18.880
Some will say here on flick it wants toe set choice off one on the same thing.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.980
I'm gonna copy and paste for the others by changing the value off this.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.100
So by clicking on any off,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.090
these buttons were actually calling dysfunction,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.650
which changes the value off this choice.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.240
Na Mikel control the appearance of each of the deal because the Chinese is changing based

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.950
on the click that you have done.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.980
So the first thing that we're gonna do is tow type deal on that day is gonna convince on

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.150
these four days.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.180
I would like your NGO switch equals two choice on Don't make that.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.550
This is an expression.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.280
We will add a square bracket.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.460
So the Ng's,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.710
which now checks the value off Childs with an expression that I'm gonna be here in each of

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.170
the deal.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.930
Now,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.750
this is the structural directive that controls the appearance off each off this deal.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.040
So that structural do here would be star NJ switch kids equals toe.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.380
I can see you that if it's one,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.100
then this is the one to be displayed.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.300
If this is too,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.280
then this is the one.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.450
So I'm gonna copy this being stupid and make the necessary changes.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.110
Save the file.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.940
If I go back to the Rosell,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.600
I see four buttons.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.610
But it says this is due number one.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.490
I changed 04 And it is This is to number four,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.480
but I do.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.150
I click.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.950
It says this is the number two and number treats each one of them work just like that.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.610
Now,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.820
just to make sure that this looks better.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.810
So what we can do is we can add some content.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.680
Let's say I want our here.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.450
I had a row with two calls.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.250
Andi in each one of them in our own image.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.190
Let the first burden corresponds to Tiger.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.240
Andi,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.500
I want to get some information about Tiger from the key.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.000
Piteous.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.850
I'll goto Wiki.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.170
Very good.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.740
On opened the first ling,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.950
That is this image I'm gonna copy the plant on and based here.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.640
And then I copied the first paragraph on then paste here as well.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.580
So we have the 1st 1 And likewise,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.260
I'm gonna do the same thing for the other views as well.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.560
So copy for four of them,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.420
Four different types of images and content.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.650
So the 2nd 1 is lion.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.950
3rd 1 is cheetah.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.050
And for this eagle,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.540
save it.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.200
Go back to the browser on and check without Tiger Lion,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.230
Cheetah Eagle Clicking on that I get the respective details Now.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.570
Sometimes this might look like a cab,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.370
so that's what we want to achieve.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.460
So instead of but in primary I can change is too important Link on now.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.030
Of course,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.650
it will look nicer.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.040
So take a lion,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.840
cheetah and eagle.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.120
We can also have a default option in case if I have one more right now.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.370
Let's say copy this whole thing and then paste it on.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.250
Let's it.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.750
This is the child's timber.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.440
Fine.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.680
And I type your something called five,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.590
which I don't have.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.490
So when I click on bite on,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.450
nothing appears over here.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:57.160
So we can also add another deal and say that this particular deal is a default.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.050
So the NGO switch default.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.130
Andi,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.870
you don't have to give anything for that.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.160
And then you can type your no content our level for this election.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.730
Sorry,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.750
insurance.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.960
Save it.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.680
Go back.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.240
So now I take on eagle,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.070
I get the output and I click on this.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.360
It is no content available for selection.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.790
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.320
So off course I can go back now.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320
One problem is that if I select cheetah here and then if I refresh the page,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.130
you'll see that it resets toe the 1st 1 Because in the component you can see the choice

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.110
equals to one Is the tea for value.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.270
So every time you refresh,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.590
the component is reloaded and the choices reset to one.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.710
What we would like to do here is that we want toe a sign that previously made choice to

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.620
this variable.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.060
But we have to store it somewhere else because when the browser is refreshed,

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.280
we lost that data,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.100
so we have to store it somewhere else.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.450
And where we can stories is something called session storage.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.160
I can add a key here called as for example,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.840
they use a child's equals.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.380
Two.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.150
I can say choice,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.440
Andi,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.840
When you say NGO on,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.600
it'd check if the value is present.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.510
If their values present Ussing,

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.630
toe this choice so I can see here.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.160
Give this value is available.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.720
Then you can say you're destruct.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.340
Choice equals toe.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.420
Get the value from session stories to save this.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.380
Go back to the browser.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.610
Now I goto cheetah and I refresh the browser on.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.420
You can see that it should still come back to Cheetah Goto Eagle.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.310
And then I reflect this page.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.610
It should still come back toe the eagle.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.500
If a good developer tools look at the application,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.020
there is a local storage and station storage and in the station storage for this particular

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.550
domain.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.770
We have a value called user choice for so each time I click on an option,

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:08.610
you can see that the value is changing and this will be kept in decision storage as long as

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.090
the brother is open.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.830
For example,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.280
right now I clicked on Cheetah,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.650
so the value is three.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.350
I exit the bro's along on,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.950
then again come back.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.870
You can see that when I come back,

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.370
it comes to Tiger,

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.040
mainly because the data was dead in the session storage.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.930
There is no more data because it was lost when the brother was closed.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.100
So ultimately,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.980
we can also keep it in the local storage.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.140
Right now we don't have,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.950
but we can keep it in the local storage so that it will be persistent if I go back to this

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.050
and change from section storage,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:49.360
toe local storage and then refresh the browser once it's close.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.660
This time I select lion and then close the browser,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.900
exit the closer,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.690
and then I check once more local host for two double zero.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.280
You can see that it shows the lion by select eagle.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:12.570
I exit the closer and then open chrome once more and then I go toe locals for two double

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.060
zero.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.090
You can see it remembers the previous child,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.050
even if the browser has been close to
