X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
the leader for this particular page here is hardcore Did in the component itself injured on

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.900
the date of what this should be fetched from a remote server are from kind of a web service

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.900
.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.990
This can be done right here itself.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.450
So it's not a good practice.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.620
It would be good to create a reusable class card as a service class on,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.790
then put all your business logic our data access logic in the service plants and use them

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.350
in multiple places are multiple components.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.930
Now,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.580
to do this,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.310
we have to create a service class.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.380
Let's go back to the command prompt on.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.570
Let me clear this.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.170
And then I'm gonna use N g g.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.090
And then I can say s for service.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.340
Or you can say in degenerate surveys.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.300
And then I give your folder where I want to create my services.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.780
I can give service our services and then I will give what in the name of the service I can

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.530
call it as a phone book.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.320
Now it's gonna clear the phone book surveys dot ts plus it also going to give me test cases

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.320
,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.840
which I don't want on spectacles to farts.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.740
It's gonna cleared one single typescript plants,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.650
no update toe the at model ts.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.420
Now let's go back and open the same thing.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.650
So we're gonna go here.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.310
Uh,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.270
look at the a slash service slash phone books in his 30 s that has created a classical

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.360
phonebook service.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.650
But for now,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.380
we want to have a function here that can give you contact details I'm gonna give here.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.150
Get contact Details are something like that,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.490
which takes an i d.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.610
Off number type.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.450
So it's supposed to take an idee.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.060
And according to the idea to postulate undervalued.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.500
So what is it supposed to return?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.700
It's supposed to return a single contact object.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.120
Of course.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.950
Your import that on then here is where you create the object and returned the same thing.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.710
Now,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.410
I really This is supposed to make a request toe.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.350
Http Web salaries.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.870
What?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.240
We will do that a bit later.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.750
So I'm extract this court from here on.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.130
Then put that in this particular service now.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.020
So in love,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.890
contact our i d equals toe one I would like to say I need that is suffered by the user.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.110
Now it says here that distort contacted secretaries in other because we don't have any

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.870
member available.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.810
Call contact here.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.730
So what I do that this kid up on these things start somebody who's commanding on Mac

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.400
control the on windows and select all of them.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.350
And then believe that,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.130
of course,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.080
one last thing is I'm going to find a local variable called Contact.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.060
So let contact.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.730
It goes to a new contract object,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.650
and then I'm sending all these values.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.750
On day one,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.320
they ascend all these values.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.590
I may have to return that.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.050
So let's do a return contact as well.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.040
So now we have a function that's gonna written an object of contact type with all these

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.630
values.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.540
Now,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.170
here,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.770
we need to receive that.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.500
The question is,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.300
how do I get that function here?

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.470
So one way you can do is you can always create an object off this clans phone book series,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.310
for example.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.200
You can say left service people's toe,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
new phone book,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.720
Soviet like this.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.260
And then you can see here they start contact equals tow service.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.870
Start,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.270
get contact details,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.640
right.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.000
And of course,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.030
I need to supply an idea.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.440
Let's apply ideas One.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.000
Now,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.340
if you go back to a brother,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.760
you should see the output without any problem.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.670
So we get that Hollywood.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.810
This is not the way you should be doing,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.660
mainly because the phone book service class itself may have some dependencies on another,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.650
literally or another service subject.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.650
For example,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.250
if we want to make a request to and it's TDP Webster reason point,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.000
we would be using something called Hits TTP Client,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.010
which is from angular.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.420
So now we don't know how to create an object off that.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.410
So we want angular to give me that object as well.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.010
So obviously doing this has lots and lots off drawbacks.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.670
In this particular case,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.310
it worked.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.360
I showed that.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.200
But it's not the right way to do the right way to do that would be toe Ask angular to

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.180
create an object off this phone book service and inject that to me so that when you do is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.050
you define on.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.680
Your dependence is in the constructor.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.260
Now you should know that we never created an object off this contact details component.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.550
It is angular,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.560
which is creating an object off this class.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.150
Now,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.180
obviously angular,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.470
is supposed to call this particular constructor on at that is when.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.390
If we define a variable here,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.570
let's call it a service Onda.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.370
We defined their data type of this called as phonebook saris.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.350
Now angular knows that it has to create an object off this phone book service.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.120
Now,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.700
at this time,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.250
where angular does this angular is going to look into the positive way.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.150
Do we already have an object off phone book surveys?

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.160
If the answer is yes,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.610
it's gonna inject that here.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.100
But if the object has not been created yet,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.840
it's gonna be creating one object and then passing that to me here,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.620
right,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.190
so that's called as a singleton.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.900
That means that at any point in time,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.360
you will have a single instance off phone books or risk class so on when angular created

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.440
that class.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.630
So if there is any dependencies mentioned over here,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.380
angular would also inject.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.450
Those dependence is because it's now angular responsibility to create the object.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.250
So now that we have received that object overhears,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.950
this variable becomes local to this particular curly bracket pair,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.900
which means I have to create a member variable here on.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.020
Then I have to assign that local variable to the member variable and so on.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.120
But typescript has a fantastic feature here.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.080
I can declare this constructor argument to be high rate our public are protected and they

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.800
automatically make this as a member.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.460
Variable now,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.390
right?

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.350
So obviously in our taxes that over here I now have to say this starts that we start get

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.970
contacted off one.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.830
And if you go back to the browser and you can see that the output also is coming here,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.430
we'll also add one more small details here.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.560
So let's add a contact art picture equals two.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.260
I'm gonna add a You are today's.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.290
This is an external link,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.550
so I'll save this.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.950
We're not used to this picture anywhere.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.100
So let's go to the contact details component html Probably right below the HR.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.050
So it's island.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.510
I am G on.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.870
Now we have to take SRC equals two.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.430
Now the question is how do I mean With the picture now,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.120
very simple.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.460
I can always use your contact our picture like this which is an expression that expression

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.400
will be resolved.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.550
The value of the picture will be ascent to the SRC.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:51.190
Let me also add a bit off styling so that's not a strain equals two height off that there

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.220
won 50 picks up on that.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.010
Save this.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.260
I go back to the browser and I should see a picture along with this.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.950
Now,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.830
this is not any special,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.770
but if you're designing an attribute,

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.990
an expression this can be awarded in another.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.210
Wait.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.390
So,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.990
for example,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.270
if I remove this here,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.780
then it will assume that this is the actual value.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.530
That means it's looking for a picture whose name is contact our picture,

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.460
which is wrong.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.270
So obviously you're gonna get an error,

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.030
are you?

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:28.530
Make it a broken picture plus an error saying that it's looking for local host for two

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.620
double zero stretch.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.060
Contact that picture.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.360
Now we want to tell angular that this is not a string value.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.220
It is an expression onda.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.540
One way of doing being seen already by using a calibrated.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.390
The other way of doing is by surrounding this SNC with a square bracket.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.740
So we say now that this brandy,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.070
what we're assigning is an expression,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.540
not actual hard core values.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.700
So when I say this the issue see the same picture coming back again
