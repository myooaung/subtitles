00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
In the previous video,

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.140
we saw the software center required for working with an angular project be built,

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.100
an angular project using the N.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.080
G or angular CLN.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320
We made some changes in our applications.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.700
So how the whole thing works on this particular model,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.050
I want to show you as what is an angular component.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.690
What is a module?

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.610
And how do you boot stop that component?

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.140
Everything from the scratch.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.150
So for this and you use the same project that we used in the previous video.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.290
But I'm gonna delete all things that are 100 It,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.390
especially the up part of it.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.160
So I'm gonna select a lot these fines here.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.210
And if I select on delete,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.040
you should see that there will be editors project.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.620
So if I say view developer on developer tools are Charles kept concern,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.370
which is,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.870
Ah,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.110
command ship J Control Shivji.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.780
So this is where you're going to see others liken talk this on the right side so we can see

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.450
the page as well as this.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.750
So if I go here and delete these files,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.380
you would see that it's gonna cause a and a bunch of adults in a minute because the final

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.670
story exists it street compiling,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.010
and it's coming back with thing that hey failed the Lord.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.190
We don't even have an at module on.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.880
And that's kind of that's That's an other coming because our main Doherty s which is the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.850
entry point now,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.800
where is that mentioned as an entry point in angular Jason?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.040
We saw that the main five is nothing but SRC dot Main doctor.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.510
Yes.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.180
If ago domaine dot ds,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.730
you'll see that it refers toe app module which just know be deleted.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.950
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get it off all these things at an import.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.440
So let's say import our dog slash ab slash Let's hear,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.570
for example,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.740
my example,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.650
uh,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.840
as a samadi,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.500
as you know,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.800
that it doesn't exist.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.130
That's created one here,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:13.420
So I'm gonna go go to the app andan I'll say new fine car mind example APD RTs And if I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.900
sell it?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.850
If it simply taken so long,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.930
Andi then I take your say so from my example Savage.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.340
Let's go see what happens when really fresh.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.160
Let me restart the several Angie So?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.680
So there is no address we could go back to the browser.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.520
You'll see that hello from my example app.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.790
The output comes,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.290
but at this point in time,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.850
it's no longer an angular application because there's no angular inward.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.430
So the only thing that is in order is that your backpack looks at the main door,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280
tears on imports this file,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.080
and in that file,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.530
all I have got to the console dot log.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.450
There's no angular inward here.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.050
So this is where we wanted to get an angular application.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.190
So I'm gonna go and clear that class.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.500
So it's a class.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.280
Let's say it's called Hello,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.950
world component.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.140
Andi,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.340
nothing there.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.940
I'm gonna give you a message for further timing.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.310
Anything.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.980
I'm just gonna have a class.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.940
But this class becomes a component by adding at component to your plus.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.360
I know that because this is an angular project.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.070
Lot off angular support is provided by via score,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.260
and it's also automatically give me auto import from angular core on.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.030
When I do that,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.380
it comes up at decorator in typescript is always given with curly bracket and a bunch of

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.570
options on.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.930
The only option that I'm looking at right now is going to be a selector.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.310
And since our selector waas already and uproot in index edged human probably can see that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.280
in index HTM and we have this approach slash uproot.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.810
I'm gonna just use the same selector off course.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.560
If I make some changes over here,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.210
I may have to do the same thing in index start.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.460
It's human as well.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.140
And one more thing that I want to give here is a template.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.730
I can either give a template,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.860
which is a hard border html content here or I can't refer to an externally steam and file.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.950
So for the time being,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.960
I'm gonna give template and I'm going to use this template string,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.880
which is called Ptolemy Type multiple lines.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.120
So I'm gonna stay pure.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.790
It's one and then they would slash edge one on oppressed ender.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.410
That staple paragraph on a PR a message from you know,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.010
slash B on.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.010
That's my output for the components.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.780
Wherever this component uproot stash approaches there,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.230
I want this particular message to appear so at this time we have created a class on the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.690
class is a component,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.540
but we have to give this toe angular on Say that Hey,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.950
inject this in this particular location.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.180
And to do that,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.080
you have to make a component part off a model.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.870
And a model is nothing but plants.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.070
Let's call it us after what you are.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.730
Any name off our choice.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.850
My model,

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.670
for example.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.770
But it's just that plants just like how this is a regular class converted into confident.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.910
Using this decorator,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.760
we have to use that engine module once again.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.440
Auto import from that angular slash court.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.190
Andi,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.720
this is where you say that.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.000
Hey,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600
we have to bootstrap this particular component,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.250
sometimes a booster on Don't say that Hello were component.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.500
But right now,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.380
the whole oral component is not part of this model.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.320
And in order to say that this is going to be part of the model we say here declarations.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.170
Andi,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.570
in the declarations were going to say a list off all components that you're gonna have here

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.570
.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.370
Part of this model will be listed over here,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.300
but bootstrap is only the one that are going to be used in the index.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.930
It's human.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.410
So this is where I say hello.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.630
World component is one of my component now,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.500
one minimum requirement here is that the browser support because ultimately we want angular

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.540
toe modify that dome so they don't.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.140
Manipulations are done by using a module which is called as a browser module.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.550
Okay,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.770
so it doesn't appear able to sit in automatically come.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.550
No problem.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:41.500
We can always imported import off from you can say at angular slash browser off from closer

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.780
on the day you can see that there is one called a frozen module.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.970
That is what we want to you know,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.060
including our application that is come now that we have got a component,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.860
a component this part of the angular module called at Marty.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.870
You see,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.140
they're still there is no all put its refreshed,

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.160
but there is no awkward.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.170
That's mainly because we never told so vacated angular models.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.950
We can clear a number off angular models,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.590
but we never said that.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.950
Use this model and bootstrap that,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.200
and this is where we need a function.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.710
Call on.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.340
This is the last part of the puzzle.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.120
So I say,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.400
import from at angular slash platform browser dynamic.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.450
This provides a function.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.920
It's use that that from grows a dynamic that's a function.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.590
So we're gonna use this function.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.210
Andi call this and then returns on object.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.010
And we said that Hey,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.270
boost up the model for at market.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.980
So if I go here and then say,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.380
which is the models?

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.740
It's called at module.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.800
And now if I save this,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.210
you should see that we get our component.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.960
They can see that big our hello world message from we know Black form Brother Dynamic is

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.170
the one that's doing the job.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.060
So this one basically dynamically scans your index edged demons.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.180
Why is that Index html looked in?

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.910
If you look at the angular door Jason,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.530
we said that,

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:07.960
Hey,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.940
this is a file that that's supposed to be bootstrapped.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.120
So when you say platform browser dynamic dot bootstrap model,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.110
it's going to take this model and finds out the bootstrap component.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.440
And it is a hello world company.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.510
The hollow earth component is identified as a tag called Uproot,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.230
and it's gonna look in the index html for this particular aboot.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.480
If it is found,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.860
then this is where it's going.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.250
Toe inject at this particular content is gonna be placed in the location where Absolute

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.470
Slash approved instead.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.910
And that's what is happening right now it's It's even the recorded that component first and

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.840
then it on,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.680
then maybe does a part of a module.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.190
But Angulo starts the work once this is given,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.160
so it's going to look for a model.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.350
And that model has a bootstrap component,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.470
and that component is status.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.040
So the question is,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.210
Can I have multiple components?

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.100
In an HTML?

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.960
For example,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.600
can I save your Let's go toe index html?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:14.190
Let me hear a welcome slash at welcome withered to produce any all put as such.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.620
There is no errors,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.800
and there's no nothing is happening at this point in time.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:25.070
But can I clear another component here and make it part of the same model on it is possible

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.070
.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.600
For example,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.750
I can say your class welcome component,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.730
Andi.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.740
I just say here,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:36.610
complainant a component and I have to give minimum selector in a template.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.220
I'll give your a selector is ab welcome.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.210
That's what we used just now in the index html here and then I would say the template for

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.550
that is a simple H one or H three.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.430
Welcome to angular.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.640
So in training slash extreme,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.990
I save it.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.930
I have created a component.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.000
It's not gonna appear mainly because it's not part of this particular model.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.890
So in order to make it part of the model,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.930
I have to say that it's a welcome component.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.580
Now you see that I have made it as part of this,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.250
but in index html,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.150
it is there.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:23.310
It doesn't appear here mainly because we have so say that it has to be one of the bootstrap

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.580
company on.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:24.960
Now,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.860
If I were welcome,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.490
component stated,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.360
hopefully I should see a welcome message.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.460
Also So bootstrap component is the one that is gonna be looking index.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:36.990
It's German.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.160
So if I don't do that over here on,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.880
let me get it off that from the index,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.760
it's demon on.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:50.570
So now I can still make this component presented to the user by making this component part

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.160
of the hello world components as have no,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.780
you can see that it is not included in my foot.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.630
But I can go to my hello component on in the helo component.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.990
I can always provide.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.270
Here we are.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.700
I don't know.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.110
Maybe also because anyway,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.630
it's gonna print extreme.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.170
So I'll say here,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.760
ak tash,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.640
Welcome slash.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.670
So as you can see that now.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.800
I don't need that to be a part of the bootstrap list here because it's not going to be

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.110
looked in the index HTM.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.590
But instead,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.130
it's going to be part off another component.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:26.460
Hello,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:26.540
er,

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.090
components.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.560
So as a matter saved right now,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.360
it is not there.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.180
If I save it and if I come back over here,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.480
you should see that.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.870
Welcome.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.940
Triangular seven training comes up on.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.650
So So this is how you can create a component,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.380
make it part of a N G module.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.960
In our case,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.360
it's the APP model and then bootstrap,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.030
that s o that Apple is actually going to be injected.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.540
The components are going to be injected.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.380
Tau our index html.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.350
Of course,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.330
a lot of things can be reflected over here.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.000
For example,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.370
it's not a good idea to keep all these classes in one place.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.240
It's a good idea to keep this in one job aspect or typescript.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.110
Module exported.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.990
Export This one on here.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.510
All right.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.910
Another model where you import everything and then start using that.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.950
So that's what we would be doing essentially.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:22.190
But just toe make you understand in an actual the basically on engine module is the one

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:28.150
that is bootstrapped by angular engine model has on the bunch of components that it refers

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.450
to Andi.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.650
Then it picks up one of the component to be looping in the index.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:34.180
It's team,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.990
that's what it's actually doing.
