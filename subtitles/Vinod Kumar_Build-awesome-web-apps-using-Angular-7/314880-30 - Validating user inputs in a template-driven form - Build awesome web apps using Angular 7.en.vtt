WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
so using the conduct form,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.840
we were able to add a new contact details.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.450
Andi,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.930
let's go back over there.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.890
So for thing is,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.900
let's get off this part which is given in the HTML.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
So we have this be with Jason,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.250
so we don't need that.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.220
Let's go back and see that that just under the nexus.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.450
No.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.530
But one thing is that without typing any first name,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.190
last name,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.690
email or phone number,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.250
I am still able to add a new contract.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.120
And that comes with a new idea.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.650
Also,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.370
there is no first name last name.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.080
None of these details exist.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.730
Of course,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.820
we don't want such details to be accepted It all.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.350
Let's delete this and see how this can be handled.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.650
So in the ad conduct form,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.980
first thing is,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.120
if the minimum mandatory fields are not endured,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.390
I don't want this person to be enabled at all,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.650
so users cannot accidentally take that.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.860
Plus,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.810
let's assume that the first name is mandatory on minimum that three letters must be there

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.850
and maximum 15 letters.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.850
Similarly,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.070
I want tohave Ah,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.380
restriction that email is a mandatory field phone number must be ender,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.160
and it has to be a 10 digit numerical well and so on and so forth.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.230
So if I want to provide such validations,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.140
how did we do that?

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.330
To understand how the form medication euston First,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.890
let's have a look at the documentation.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:36.630
So goto angular dot io that is docks fundamentals forms on.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.120
You can see that there is something called form brandish.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.940
And they have explained here how the phone validation is done in both Templin driven as a

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.350
less reactive forms.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.630
But if he scrawled on here So basically what they say here is that you have to define a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.360
variable,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.430
which is the template variable here.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.460
Hash name.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310
You can give anything here.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.300
For example,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.800
in our case,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.950
this could be hash first name and equals toe engine More.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.240
Now with this,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.790
what happens that angular creates an object corresponding toe the field.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.020
We can access that using this particular hash name,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.840
for example,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.050
there.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.950
Given here something like if name corresponds toe engine model than you can say named,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.640
are invalid or named are dirty etcetera.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.770
So we'll have a look into this.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.150
That's how this can be done.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.310
So the first thing that we want to do is tow Goto,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.770
one of the fields hash first mean equals toe energy model that also are a few other basic

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.460
validations.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.210
For example,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.800
I can say that this field is a required feet.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.360
Mainland equals to treat in excellent equals to 15 for example Steve it on.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.210
If you go back to the browser,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.050
we see the farm.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.520
Let's go and have a look at this particular field.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.830
So I select this pattern here and then choose my first name feed on.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.790
When I select this,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.610
I get the actual generated input element.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.800
While we have given few attributes here like type class Islay Editor,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.330
you can see that there is an additional attributes also,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.100
one of them is the class.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.450
Of course,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.520
we have given the class but you can see we have given only farm control.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.800
But now we have additional Engy untouched Engy pristine N G invalid thes CSS classes are

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.400
added based on the stage off this particular extracts.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.750
Since we said that this textbook swelling is required on we have not entered.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.600
It says here it is invalid and that class name has been applied Similarly,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.100
the engine pristine CSS last name is a play because we have not made any changes to that.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.560
The moment I make some changes to this and even if I bring it back to its original state,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.100
it will no longer be considered as pristine.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.580
But it will be considered as dirty.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.360
For example,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.090
if I go and I fear X on,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.950
then it is that you can see that now has the CSS class name here saying that form control

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.580
which is what we have given it,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.250
says Engy invalid because there's no value in that.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.590
It now says NJ dirty instead off n g pristine Similarly,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.840
there waas earlier Engy untouched.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.350
Now it is engine touched and this would be useful for mobile devices.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.320
So the Engy invalid CSS data but will be removed automatically as soon as a satisfied the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.240
field requirements.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.840
For example,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.660
if I type here,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.330
we know as you can see that I have made sure that the values entered so required is taken,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.800
get up,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.180
also have entered five letters,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.740
So mainland property also has been taken.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.870
Get off because originally,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.610
if you see the CSS class name,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.830
it is your Engy valued.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.640
Of course,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.750
if I bring this back toe,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.840
say two letters you can see now it is n g invalid because now it's not satisfying the field

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.570
requirement.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.150
So this is a CSS class that helps us understand what is the state off this particular field

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.870
Now,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.480
along with the CSS class names like here,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.970
we also have properties so we can make use off these properties like pristine,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.320
valid invalid editor off a particular field to deter mine whether to display an error

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.720
message.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.770
Here are not also notice that the extra bucks here is part of a form.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.670
And if you go to the form element over here,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.170
you can see that the form also is considered as invalid as soon as they types on meaningful

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.780
information.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.490
Over here,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.860
you can see that the form itself is now considers value.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.730
Of course,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.030
if I refresh,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.850
the form is now in the pristine state,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.700
so you could go back to the form again.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.790
You can see that a form is in the pristine state and it is invalid because one off the text

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.910
boxes is invalid,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:00.790
right?

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.840
So we can now leverage this property and say that disabled this Wharton are changed the

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.280
color toe red eso when the form is invalid.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280
So how do we do this?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.070
Let's go and check that out first.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.660
So now that I've given your basic requirement here,

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.370
required mainland and maximum let's go to the button and we will are a disabled property

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.070
over here.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.350
If the form is invalid,

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.300
The first thing is we had to give hash some form name that's called us F one equals tow N G

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.920
form.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.610
Once we give this now,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.730
we can access the entire form on the farms estate using this F one so I can come down to my

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.320
partner and I can adhere that disabled actually route.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.590
Not that the straight record indicates what were we are ascending is an expression.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.460
So I can say a form dot Invalid.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.210
So ass in a serious.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.700
And if you go back to the plaza,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.980
you can see that the form is in an invalid state.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.550
On I have the button being disabled so I can click this now.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.140
Right?

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.550
So if I come down to the button,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.020
you can see that the disabled attribute has been added over here.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.760
Of course,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.080
if I type here some first name,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.890
let's type here we Not.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.120
If I come down now,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.410
we can see that the pattern is enable I should be able to add a new contact with only the

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.010
first name.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.350
We can also change the color off this by changing this particular property.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:35.780
Not that this is a string here and we can substitute this primary with danger in gated,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.950
the farmers invalid.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.930
So how do we do this?

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.360
Let's get off this for a minute and we'll put a double curly bracket toe.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.880
Indicate that you're gonna put an expression with the F one dot invalid.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.350
Is that true?

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:56.790
So I can put a question mark if it's invited with on a danger and otherwise will say here

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.770
that it's private.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.630
So since initially the form is invalid,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.130
it will be Bt in cash danger.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.860
Once I enter some values in the textbooks,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.540
you will see that this becomes BT and Dash Primary.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:14.850
So let's go back to the browser on the form is already split and you can see at the bottom

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:14.850
.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.830
The button is disabled and it's in red color.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.370
As in other types and names like the note,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.780
you can see that now we have the blue color button,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.380
which is also a neighbor on the same lines.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.740
Let's also are a couple of other violations.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.520
For example,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:37.910
I also want the email to be mandatory so I can type your hash.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.740
Email equals two n g.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.950
Modern and then I can see it quiet.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.550
So you're a couple of things like hash phone P equals two N g.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.040
Modern.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.930
This'd is required because we're dealing with contacted.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.790
It's at equals.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.050
Toe slash de four digit.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.350
This is the typical regular expression,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:05.420
but I also want to say a minimum off tender digits and a maximum off 12 digits to this

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.440
particular phone number.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.790
So let's save this.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.700
Andi,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.060
go back to the Frozen.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.580
We'll see that the farmers in the disabled state that's going under first name,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.230
I'm you can see there's still disabled.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:25.060
That center email that said at example dot com so but it is still disabled.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.860
Phone number I under some numbers.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.330
Now we can see it is still disabled,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.080
but as soon as they enter the 10 to the judge,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.540
you can say it is enable now.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.870
But if I enter 11 still okay,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.570
12.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.530
It is okay,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.500
but 30 letter not Okay,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.870
So this is how you will be able to use certain patterns also in your validations.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.280
So now that we have enabled or disabled,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.850
But based on the validation,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.830
we also have to tell the user that why this particular button is disabled in case if you

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.010
make some mistakes like for example,

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.510
I removed the first name,

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.260
it should tell me here that the first name is mandated.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:09.090
So let's go back to our core on add a couple of days to display other messages.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.930
Now number one error message would be that the first name field is mandatory,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.690
and that should appear only if the user has not entered anything yet.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.710
The 2nd 1 would be Milland equals toe three.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.000
That means we have to tell the user that a minimum feeler does you must up line and that I

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.410
don't leave.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.630
The user has not yet done so.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.380
And of course,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.230
the 3rd 1 We don't need to respect,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.710
because if you have a Max land property,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.430
the browses don't allow you to type more than 15 characters at all.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.150
So that's gonna add a couple of deals.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:45.250
So I have a parent deal on day two Children deals forward here.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.140
The 1st 1 would probably say that forced mean these require on mandatory on the second

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.450
error message would be like,

00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:01.180
um so please enter cased three letters for first name.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.600
I see this.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.300
Go back to the browser and you'll see that we have no displayed these two other messages.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.130
So we can also add some styling to this,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.520
such as,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.390
for example,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.270
it has to be in a little red color.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.530
It has to be a bit smaller than the rest of the labels as well.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.680
You may say it has to be italicized to do that.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.530
We have Odysseus this class.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.350
Let's call this as a class for ER of plastic costume.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.030
Jara.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.860
And we don't have this particular CSS class.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.070
So let's add one.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:44.590
So I'm gonna open that CSS fine corresponding toe are contact component.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.920
CIA says that they thought ER,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.510
which creates a new class,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.770
has given color offer it foreign stayed.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.600
Let's give italics on.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:02.530
We want to reduce the fun size to around 80% off its original saves forgiving 800.8 p.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:02.890
M.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.000
So if I save this and if you go back to the browser I should see that the other messages

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.450
are as expected.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.490
The only thing that we don't want this is we don't want to scare the user by displaying all

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.170
the pregnancy.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.260
Justin Edwards.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.980
So what we want to do is we have to ensure that the user has started typing in the first

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.420
name,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.460
and then he has not typed enough.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.520
Characters are,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.750
if he decides and erases everything,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.290
the first name is required.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.650
Ademas featured appear.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.120
So to do that,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.290
that's at an if condition over here.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.990
So we're gonna add a directive.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.430
Col.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.920
N g Give equals toe.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.560
We say that first name,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.950
which is this particular variable,

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:49.760
is dirty as the last first name is invited.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.830
So show this only if it's dirty.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.750
That means something has been changed in the next ones as well as it's invalid.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.530
Now,

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.020
if I go back over here,

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.920
you'll see that it's not disturbing at once because it's in the pristine state.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.090
And if I type here something like this and you can see now it's coming as soon as a diaper

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.000
valid value,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.680
you'll see that the elements is have gone because we have ensure that it's going to be

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.410
displayed only if it's invalid.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.410
And of course,

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.600
if I make a mistake,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.500
you'll see that both of them appear on the same logic.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.450
We can also are.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.200
If conditions over here,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.930
for example,

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.700
I can say,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.860
star Angie,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.460
if if we're still forced leave,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.510
don't Errors first named are arrested,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.170
an object representing on the others.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.350
If they exist,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.610
I'm gonna say,

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.550
if one of the other is called choir,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.170
then we want this to be displayed.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.720
So we say that sure,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.750
this particular message only if the errors collection contains required.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:55.170
So the same thing we're gonna copy and paste for the next one make a bit of changes.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.500
So basically,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.310
we want to say this should display only if the mainland validation is failing.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.490
Copy this and based over here now I saved this.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.750
I go back to the browser,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.180
you'll see that there's no other message.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.670
As soon as I start typing a single letter,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.950
you can see that it says please under at least three letters for first name.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.250
I ender more than trees.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.420
No problem now,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.200
So if I start raising,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.260
you'll see that the other message appears back less.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.460
If it completely it is this you will see that it is.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.700
First name is required.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.640
So this is how you can add customized error messages on.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.180
So So let's go back.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.920
Copy this on paste for email.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.180
So email has only one valuation,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:46.010
which is it's required some paste over here and say that this is basically email on this is

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.740
email.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:52.560
Hasn't errors called required will display that email address is required?

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.760
We don't have the mainland validation for this,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.850
so we'll get up this.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.640
Let's copy the same thing for four.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.300
Number on phone number has two elevations this time,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.060
so one is a required.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.130
So just like that.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:12.540
So I'm gonna say you're because this for so phone is dirty as a less phone is invalid as a

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.060
last phone has an editor score required.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:16.610
And,

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.930
of course,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.410
the message should say phone number is required.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.550
Andi,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.700
I'm gonna copy this.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.750
Tasted phone has an editor called Pattern.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.500
We can give customers mrs saying that pleasing Bush.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:40.460
Maybe you can say 10 to 12 digits for for save it on.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.450
Let's go back to the browser toe Full refresh once.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.810
Andi,

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.080
let's see if we can do some valuation violations.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.180
So I'm gonna go type my name and free.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.450
But if I started raising there is an editor.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.080
If I completely remove this,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.390
there is an error similarly going here.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.940
I do not actually know about CO,

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.080
no problem.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.420
But if I start raising completely,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.080
you will see that it says the militants is required.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.850
Similarly,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.100
if I got a phone number,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.580
if I type even a single digits,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.830
it says that place import 10 to 12.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.520
It is for four number.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.320
So I started taping some random phone numbers.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.420
Now fastener that at the 10 digit you'll see that the other messages gone.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.200
11.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.010
No problem.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:27.460
12.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.050
No problem.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.330
But protect the 13th 1 You get that,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.180
Ademas it again.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.470
Now,

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.470
if you it is this completely,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.210
you will see that it still says for numbers required.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:41.550
So this is how you should be able to add custom validations for your form,

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.960
such that invalid data is not entered into your database
