WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
So we have built on angular service,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.200
which is injectable,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.680
and currently it is giving me one single contact object.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.480
Now,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.690
in order for us to work with money,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.310
people contact objects and understand how to fetch the data from a remote Web service

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.150
endpoint.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.150
Let's first build a Web service endpoint itself.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.440
So to this end,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.750
let's go back to a command count and I want to install something called Jason Server on.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.170
It is a very simple and sophisticated rest a service provider.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.990
Let's try installing that.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.650
So npm I for install on a life You're Jason Server.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.950
So the decent Suroor depends on age is on file,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.090
which you can keep it anywhere within your project.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.450
A tree on asylum can be anything.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.060
In fact,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.090
the later can also be served from a Jobs could file.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.350
But for now,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.140
we're gonna create a folder in our application to victory.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.400
Let's go toe thistles my application directory.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.830
So I'm gonna create a new folder here on a file inside that,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.850
Let's call it us baby slash data Jason.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.910
And this is a fight that we're gonna create Onda that fine is going to be an object.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.720
It's gonna at the Jason is going to represent an object,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.390
Onda.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.540
Each end point is represented using a key value.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.300
For example,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.160
I can pay pure contacts,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.270
which is a key,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030
and the value would be an ari.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.830
And this would be one single contact object,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.400
for example.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.660
I can say I d is one on that.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.050
I can say first name.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.590
Of course,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.940
on this being j fun,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.760
it has to be a very strict syntax.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.530
I have to say in court one on double course,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.390
First name on.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.750
Let's have you my name.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.220
Likewise,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.810
I'm gonna give the rest of the D days.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.700
So we have got first name,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.780
last name gender.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.170
He made phone City,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.540
state,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.220
country.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.240
I believe those are the values.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.550
Did I miss anything?

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.640
Yeah,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.190
date off.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.800
But so that's kind of a date of birth.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.000
So which is the will be on 1974 01 to 0.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.640
That is my first object.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.920
I can have another object just to make sure that it worked.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.250
Finds a copy of this section for the comma and taste it.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.750
So we have to conduct objects right now.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.260
Of course,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.950
as we give an i d Let's give it us,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.210
say John Doe are Let's make it as gentle on that's gonna be a female.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.690
Let's say this is an example so I can have Jane Doe at Hexham without phone.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.560
Let's put some of the phone number for every five by 897 some number.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.870
So that said,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.860
I last Texas and let's make it s U S.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.180
A.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.920
On.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.050
Let's make it us our C 85.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.450
Some other dude.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.420
Okay?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.170
And we need some image.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.590
And if I don't want to get any image,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.290
I can leave this blank,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.360
or I can even specify that this is no,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.590
because we don't have this value so we can just erase everything and then make it s no,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.250
because right now I don't have any made for that.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.220
Now let's go and check if we can work with this right now,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.280
you can see that the Jasons are what has Bean installed.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.050
I'll also go toe packaged or Jason for making an entry to start the server.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.250
So we'll go here and cleared an entry so the entry would be that's colored eyes,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.150
Jason their server.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.850
Or you can call it the rest of server anything you want,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.220
what the value for this is Jason,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.120
their server.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.290
And then you can specify the port if you want Test export by default rate starts with,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.800
I believe,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.520
3000.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.380
So let's not give that 4200 is where my angular is running.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.350
Let's give it at 4300 on.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.440
We cannot just specify that it has to watch for any changes done directly to the fine.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.270
So that is OK.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.760
And then finally with their db slash ater Jason.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.920
And that's the fight that it has supposed to start now that we have created an option here

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.920
,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.080
let's go on and run day.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.980
So in order on this you say npm Iran followed by whatever that be given here,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.010
this could be anything.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.390
I'm gonna die pure Jason Dash said,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.700
Left on If everything is ok,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.320
you should see that It says resources http locals Food three double zero slash contact.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.990
So if opened this in a browser are in a two leg postman,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.150
I should be able to see that there are two contacts.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.140
What it also allows me to do is to search my i d.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.640
For example,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.940
if It's a slash one.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.360
I should see one contact object.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.710
If I said slash two,

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.290
which is the i.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.700
D.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.820
It is actually going to search automatically in idea and use you this.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.810
This also has not seen lots of features like a pagination and so on,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.490
so we can get the data from here.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.720
Now we have to contacts here,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.410
so let's go and check that DB slash data are Jason.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.730
We have to conduct.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.230
Now.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.010
If I want more contacts like this,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.710
we can get more data from a backside called mockery dot com on.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.360
And what we have to do is to specify what other fields we want.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.130
What other data types we want Onda.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.990
Then we can get it in the form off CS three,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.320
Jason and so on.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.690
Now,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.870
what I will do is I'm gonna go specify that my field ideas find Terra number.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.920
This is gonna be a first name on the type first name last me email.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.350
Fine.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.690
Gender is also fine.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.000
I don't need an i p address,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.950
but I need for And if I click on the little,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.870
give me one of the feet.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.450
The types you want a concert for?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.430
For I add phone that's going at this type.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.070
We need a d will be which is a dead off.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.840
But let's go on a date.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.880
So the dates between what?

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.430
I'm gonna go give something like 01 2019 74 to,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.870
let's say some random date.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.050
03 23 I left in 98.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.180
I don't want in this form that I wanted in my eso format.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.480
So which is what we have used in our age pipe.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.200
We want our one more feel that city off type city.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.150
We want a state off state.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.620
One more country.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.750
Of course I want the country.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.600
Andi,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.050
I also want the picture.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.770
So picture is basically right.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.210
Now let me give it as black.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.940
But I am going to add an expression here.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.500
The expression is gonna gender the value based on the I d on the gender.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.850
So let me based it over here.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.970
So basically I'm building a string concatenation which is actually going to get from one of

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.000
my website in majors.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.680
Andi,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.510
if the gender is male,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.870
then men slash women on,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.610
then a slash and in the id slash store chip it So when I say apply,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.060
we do get basically an expression there.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.000
So we have first name last name,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.380
email,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.840
gender,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.350
phone.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.830
If you want to change the sequence,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.790
you can change the sequence like this dragon Drop on.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.470
I think it should.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.150
People think we have the date of World City State country picture.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.760
So we want only 100 records.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.560
We don't want too many of them.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.710
And we want toe.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.460
Get them in Jason format.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.970
Now you can download this or you can preview this.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.130
It's going to show you something like this.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.300
So we do how we can actually copy everything from here so I can press control.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.750
OK,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:53.030
copy and then come back Toe my data that Jason removed this Ari Andi pieced the other that

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.100
I just don't luggage,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.290
I guess.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.840
Our shift after format court Now I have 100 contact details with random data.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.860
I can go on very for the same thing by looking at local host for three double zero slash

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.630
contacts,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.230
slash say,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.890
for example,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.870
88 that the person on it is a valid picture as well.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.300
So if I copy this and opened this in and you Dad,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.140
you can see that the value picture which we can use.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.890
So now if I go back on,

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.090
make some changes to my salary is such that it is going toe frets the reader from the

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.170
remote endpoint that we just know created.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.170
We should be able to see somebody answers data over here.
