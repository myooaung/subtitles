00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
in this video.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.050
I'm going to show you how to use this zip find that you have done about it.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.760
So I have to off them here,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.050
counter actors it and phonebook abducts it.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.280
The first thing you have to do is tow unzip.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.220
In my case,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.750
I can just double click that and it is extracted right here itself.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.690
So I open a command front on this particular folder.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.320
So I'm opening it.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.990
Tell me none.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.650
See the best talk and then come down up.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.970
If you see the contents of this,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.250
you will see that there is a very core packaged or Jason,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.400
which has many dependent,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.050
is listed,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.390
installed the differences in the packaged or Jason you have to take in the command and b m

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.050
in stop.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:01:00.250
Once the installation is completed,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.220
you can bend a command.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.850
Ng's served dash full.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.390
This will run the developments.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.600
There were and opens the application in your default frozen.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:23.350
The application is running.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.450
I can click the increment are determined buttons to test the application.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.980
Maybe close the browser.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.480
That's control.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:42.220
See on the Civil War to stop this to run the phone book application Once again,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.990
I'm gonna go under the same and open a new 10 minutes.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:01.840
So the city into the application folder and under command NPM feel stop to install all the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.650
differences.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.960
I know that the installation is really let's see how to run this.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.820
Unlike the previous application,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.150
this one depends on a rest endpoint,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.940
which,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.570
if you check the package torches on there is a command.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.100
Corn Jason,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.330
Sir,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.350
were added,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.650
which starts a Jason's.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.750
There were at 43 double zero Port Number,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.550
which reads the data from DB slash later Jason.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.340
So the way you can done this is by any PM run Jason Server,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.160
and this will run the restaurant point at this particular Yuanan.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.350
And now I can open another command front or I can open in your town by prison community.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.440
And then I can say in geezer Dash full,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:10.160
No,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.420
the application is running.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.050
I can be the contact list.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550
I can click on any particular contact person,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.630
and it are.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.600
I can goto our new contact and try adding in your contact person as well
