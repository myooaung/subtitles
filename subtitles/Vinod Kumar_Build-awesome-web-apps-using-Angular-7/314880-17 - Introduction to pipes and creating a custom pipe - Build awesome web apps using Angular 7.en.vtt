00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
in angular.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.920
So we have something called pipe,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.930
which can transform a value in tow.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.030
Another value.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.870
For example,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.710
If you want to convert this into an upper case,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.540
then we do have a building pipe called upper case,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.550
so I can go to my HTML here.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.500
Onda.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.990
We do have the city so I can use a literally a pipe symbol.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.460
And then I can say your upper case,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.310
and you will see that the outcome off this would be city in upper case right?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.670
It's as simple as that.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.360
So you just have to feed in this value Onda.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.040
Then the transformation will be done by this uppercase pipe behind the scene.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.160
This a per case is an alias for a typescript,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.950
plants that has a function and that function called transform.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.680
It's this particular input as an argument and then returns as substitution value for this

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.700
entire expression.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.270
And that's what it's gonna happen.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.960
So angler has few building pipes.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.610
For example,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.650
if I goto angular Io and then goto dogs and you have this aviator French on,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.460
did you can look for Let's say,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.260
I'm looking only for pipes,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.440
and these are some of the commonly used pipes,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.760
and I can see that there is an uppercase pipe.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.640
That's the actual typescript class.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.310
Now let's say we can use the same concept.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.740
Onda convert this,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.780
enter contact object into a fulling.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.630
So,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.490
for example,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.190
it would be much easier for us to write this whole expression.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.430
So let me get it off this in their expression,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.450
and then type here something like contact.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.960
Let's feel that in tow.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.720
A pipe car that's a full name.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.090
So if I save this now,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.160
it's already giving me another here because typescript is ableto recognize that this is not

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.370
an angular building like as well as you don't have a pipe off this time.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.930
So if you go back to the browser,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.670
you'll see that there is no or put.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.550
But if I goto view,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.690
then definable JavaScript console,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.580
you should see an editor.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.470
Let's talk this under right and you can see that it gives an error.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.160
The pipe full name could not be found on its giving another right here,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.850
so the contact bite full name,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.050
and this is where we can create our own right?

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.880
So let's do that by going toe the client prompt just like how we generated components this

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.470
time a military n G generate fight soapy for pipe here.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.690
And then you can specify fives.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.370
That's gonna be my folder name.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.380
And what is the name of the bite you want?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.250
So I'm gonna call this ass for me.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.170
It's gonna clear a couple of files Number one would be a pipe itself.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.730
A second would be a speck.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.940
So I don't want to create any test cases at this time.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.170
So let's try down spectacles to forms onder.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.230
If a press enter,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.150
it's gonna create one single file on updates the module file as well.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.030
So that's because just like how you have a component to be part of a module,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.240
even pipes also are supposed to be part of MRT.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.350
So now that we have done that,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.850
let's go back and check.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.220
Is there any change?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.970
You can see that there's no editor,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.500
but we don't have an output.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.650
Also here on the reason for that is very simple.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.450
So let's go check it out.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.060
Let me close on the fines on de minimis goto SRC ab,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.980
and you see that there is spite and full name dark type tortillas is a new friend that got

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.650
generated and that is a class with a function called as a transform.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.050
It receives value as some arguments and doesn't return anything at this point in time

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.510
because it is not returning anything.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.460
It's actually on empty string that we get.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.180
You can also see that the class is decorated with pipe on that has a name and the name is

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.680
fully This is the name that we defined in the command prompt Andi.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.750
It comes with a class called full name pipe Implement type transform.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.320
Now,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.630
this is the function that we would like to use so that maybe have been using this somewhere

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.350
is like we said that in biblical record with it contact life,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.020
full me So which means that I'm expecting the left turns it off this pipe to be an object.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.110
So what we're receiving here is that object here.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.010
So I can it literally say you're that this is gonna take an argument off type.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.280
Let's call it us contact off type of contact.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.360
That means you must to supply an object itself if its supply anything else that's going to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.670
be an error during usage and it is going to return a string.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.990
So between the ricin type off this dress string on,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.340
Of course,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.690
we have to return something.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.790
Now we can rate,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.150
um,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.200
conditions over here,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.690
saying that if there is nothing being supplied that's return an empty string.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.740
So I can say here,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.100
if not contact on,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.140
then I can say your return.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.550
I can supply an empty string.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.260
For if contact is an actual object,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.990
it will be off this type that people and Children.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.980
It is an object of class contact.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.850
And now I can see here something like Contact Door forced me.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.510
Plus a space one space plus contact or last name Good.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.360
A closer again,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.090
you can see that I get the first name and last name here.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.090
But what if I also want to include the tighter like Mr and Mrs and so on?

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:42.980
So let's define available card Title equals toe contact our gender two particles to men and

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.470
then I say fashion mark.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.620
Then I call it as Mr Otherwise,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.810
it's gonna be missed on.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.400
Now we can combine that with debts of title plus.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.400
So if I save it and go back to the browser,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.930
it should not see that it is Mr.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.260
We know.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.730
Come on,
