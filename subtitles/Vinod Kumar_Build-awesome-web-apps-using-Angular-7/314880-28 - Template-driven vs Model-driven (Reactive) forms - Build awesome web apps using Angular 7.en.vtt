00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
in the applications.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.700
User inputs are handled by Alphonse.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.980
A farm is a logical grouping off input elements such as text boxes,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.760
radio buttons,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.620
check boxes dropped on sup,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.790
importance and so on.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.530
Angular perverts,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.720
two different approaches to handle user inputs through forms,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.530
reactive and templates.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.050
Both of these can capture you their input from the view,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.200
validate the user input heretofore model on data model,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.350
topped it and provide every toe track changes.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.700
However,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.350
both these a protest process and manage the form data differently and offer different

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.210
advantages.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.840
In general,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.110
reactive forms are more robust.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.490
They're more scalable,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.210
reusable and testable.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.900
If forms are a keeper of your application or you are already using reactive patterns for

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.150
building your applications,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.280
then use reactive forms.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.410
Individual forms,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.270
on the other hand,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.640
are useful for adding a simple form to an app such as a user sign up form that easy toe to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.950
another,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.390
but they don't scale like really two forms.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.780
If you have a basic form,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.770
requirements and logic that can be completely managed in the template.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.850
