00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
in this video,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.110
I'm going to show you the basic set of required for getting started with an angular

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.750
application.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.280
First,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.550
we require Norges that's head towards North Chester org and we see a couple of options here

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.550
.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.790
There is a ideas.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.180
Long term support end out for dinner or two on the current Levin Dirt fight or zero Onda.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.170
During installation,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.750
you might find something on your washing here,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.880
so click on this to download.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me see.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.650
We don't mind this stock and open that which begins the installation process.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.250
This installation is produce straight forward.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.750
It's good to the default options,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.750
okay?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.730
And thats done.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.370
No very far I can go toe terminal are Windows Command Brunt,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.870
Andi,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.550
look for Northern Test Affliction and that's his 11.5 point zero.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.960
By insulting Norges,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.270
we would have also got NPM using which we can install the necessary the angular framework

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.350
and its dependencies on NPM destined wash and also make sure you something like this.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.750
6.4 point one.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.070
You can update the NPM toe new Russian by typing NPM update that g n,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.920
p m and on Mac computers.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.350
You may want toe use Sudo which might ask the administrator password on Windows in B m of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.950
the desk.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.750
G indium is good enough.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.470
This will actually don't let the latest Russian off npm from Internet Onda makes that as

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.250
your cook global installation.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.090
This may take a few seconds,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.350
and once it is done,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.780
once again,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.230
we can check El Bien de stash Russian.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.920
Andi should see 6.550 now.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.540
India Minutes North Package Manager used for installation off global packages,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.990
frameworks and project dependencies to the second aspect off for projects that would be to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.380
install angular.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.790
Now when is the angular angular is actually a bunch of flight release,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.650
But in order to get started with an angular project,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.250
we have few options.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.500
Number one,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.300
if a good resources here I have few ID's that can be used for creating an angular project

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.530
on,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.190
and the ideas will take care of all those things.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.470
We will be using Visual studio court,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.300
but which is more like an extra litter,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.840
But it's a very good tool for working with angular.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.080
But there is a doing to put for angular ceiling is the command line interface,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.640
which allows us to create angular products quickly.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.260
Andi also has lots and lots off options for US toe generate few JavaScript or texted core

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.960
plus build and deploy applications as well.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.640
So we'll be using this.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.800
And for this purpose,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.570
we need to go back to the command front and install the angular see light.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.490
And to do that,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.200
I'll die every being deaf.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.280
G you can say installed.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.590
Jack.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.730
Tachy are Daddy G.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.970
Instant doesn't matter.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.950
And then I did at Angulo.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.920
It's last year.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.280
Life.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.340
Andi.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.200
If you want to specify a particular Washington,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.460
you can say at by default,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.600
it is pointing toe at latest and again,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.050
I'm a required to use.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.250
So because of the Dash G installation for a regular installation,

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.290
you don't need the pseudo option.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.350
And this time it doesn't not the buster,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.350
because it just ask previously.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.970
And this angular Seelye eyes a very useful tool,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.930
like a mention that it perverts lots and lots of option.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.880
To start with,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.050
it has an option to create a new project.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.820
It has an option to start a development Web server and so on.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.690
So very fine.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.820
If things are done,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.700
we can type n g death stash Washington in GE is the command that got installed when we did

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.350
the angular CLI installation.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.430
And here it is angular CIA,

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.260
like Washington,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.970
7.1 point four,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.400
nor Jay's Question,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.070
11 point by 11.0.0 and few other basic washing is listed over here,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.110
which is what we would be using.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.940
While there are many ideas available,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.520
one off the moster,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.990
probably powerful ideas are the Web stone,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.480
which is a commercial one.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.750
There is if there is also intelligent idea,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.070
which is primarily men for job,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.150
but it is also used for developing JavaScript applications.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.800
There is one angular idly by.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.610
Babic lives,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.470
so people were familiar with the eclipse that this is on i d build on top of a clips.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.990
So which is also very nice one.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.740
But the most commonly used one is visual studio Core,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.230
which different tastic XT editor for kidding for working with the job script Industrial

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.740
applications on that this is the one that we would be using.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.320
It is from Microsoft based Off Atom,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.580
so you can visit court dot visual studio dot com.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.910
Onda decided before is your lawyers and list out download beings,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.760
so I already have this.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.820
It's a straightforward installation.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.980
Just download this.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.830
It's a ZIP file,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.630
unzipped it and start using that.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.850
So as simple as that.
