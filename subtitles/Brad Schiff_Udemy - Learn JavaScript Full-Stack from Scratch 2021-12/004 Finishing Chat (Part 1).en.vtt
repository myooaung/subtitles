00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.690
In this lesson, we're going to work on finishing our chat feature, so in our previous lesson, we

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.740
set things up so that you can click on this icon to open the chat box.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.970
And then if you type a message into this field, hey, hello, and push enter.

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.490
Not only does your message show up in this annoying alert box, but your message is also getting broadcasted

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.760
to any and all other connected Web browsers.

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.840
OK, so for our first task in this lesson, instead of showing the message in this alert pop up, let's

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.090
instead show it within this chat log area.

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.770
Let me show you how I would set this up.

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.860
So in your text, Ed, I want you to jump in to chat.

11
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.180
J.S., this file lives within your front end JavaScript folder and then within the modules subfolder

12
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.790
up at the top of the file, within our constructor below the this dot inject html line lets out a property

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.360
that selects this div, write the div that we would want to append messages to.

14
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.460
So to do that, I would create a new property, let's say this dot chat log equals, and then document

15
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.260
dot query, selector quotes, hash tag and that div has an idea of simply chat.

16
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.410
OK, next, let's scroll down and find our open connection method.

17
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.510
So for me it's a round line number 43 and we don't actually want to show an annoying alert pop up message.

18
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.590
So let's do this within the body of our function, get rid of the alert line and instead let's call

19
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.840
a method that doesn't exist yet, but a method that we can create in just a moment.

20
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:05.010
So let's say this DOT and then call a method named display message from server parentheses to call that.

21
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.220
And within these parentheses, we would just want to pass in the data that the server is sending over.

22
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.910
Now in order for the this keyword to still be pointing towards our overall object, let's convert this

23
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.430
function into an arrow function so we can just get rid of the word function here.

24
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.540
And then after the parentheses, just include the arrow symbol.

25
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.830
Cool.

26
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.930
Now we can go create a method with this matching name.

27
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:40.740
So maybe write down here, just say display message from server parentheses, curly brackets within

28
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.530
these parentheses.

29
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.100
Be sure to include a parameter, let's say data.

30
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.790
And now within this method, this is where we would want to select this div and then append a bit of

31
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.470
new HTML onto it.

32
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.950
Technically, we could have written this code right within this area, but I like to separate it out

33
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.830
into its own separate function.

34
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:13.650
So within our new method, let's say this dot chat log dot insert adjacent HTML in parentheses, the

35
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.750
call that we give this insert adjacent HTML method to arguments.

36
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.800
So Eikon will be the first argument is where you want to insert this HTML.

37
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.660
So instead of the placeholder I would say quotes and then before and so right before the end of this

38
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.680
element or this div and then the second argument instead of the B placeholder, this is the HTML that

39
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.770
you want to insert into that element.

40
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.960
So instead of the B, I would just have back Tick's.

41
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.280
And for now, just as a simple test, let's just create a paragraph element to opening and closing paragraph

42
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.170
and then to do something dynamic in this template, literal right within the back text, we can just

43
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.660
say dollar sign curly brackets and then let's just say DataDot message.

44
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.640
Let's go ahead and save this and test it out, so back in the browser, be sure to refresh.

45
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.650
I will also refresh in this window where I'm logged in with barks a lot.

46
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.180
And if I open up the chat in this window and then also open up the chat and this window and say hello

47
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.770
there, you can see it appears there and also for this user.

48
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.260
Perfect.

49
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.090
And then within the barks a lot screen, I could say, hey, I'm a dog.

50
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.490
And you can see it appears in the window where I'm logged in with Brad.

51
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.360
This is great.

52
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.110
Except instead of just a simple paragraph with the chat message, we'd probably also want to show the

53
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.070
person's username and avatar who wrote each message.

54
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.630
Now, instead of having you write a ton of HTML by hand to set up that formatting, let's just copy

55
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.270
and paste a bit of code from our GitHub repo.

56
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.220
So from the same repository we've been using in this course, just dig in to the O2 complex app folder

57
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.620
and then the O1 HTML templates folder and we are interested in the chat.

58
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.310
Dasch visible the HTML file within that file.

59
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.260
I want you to look for line number seventy three.

60
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.940
You'll see a comment that says template for messages from others.

61
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.330
And here we can see a comment where it says and template.

62
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.230
So I want you to select these seven lines of code.

63
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:44.750
So let's copy these seven lines into our clipboard and then back in our text editor within our display

64
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.400
message from Server Method.

65
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.850
Let's get rid of the simple P tag.

66
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.100
So now we just have an empty pair of back ticks within the back ticks.

67
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.210
You can drop downs or on a separate line and paste in your clipboard.

68
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.040
For now, we can leave the example hardcoded avatar of barks a lot and we can also leave the hardcoded

69
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.590
username of barks a lot Colen.

70
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.920
But let's at least swap out the message text.

71
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.660
So let's delete this.

72
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.770
I am doing well.

73
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.820
How about you?

74
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.910
And in its place, let's say dollar sign curly brackets and then just say data dot message.

75
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.680
OK, let's go ahead and save this and let's test it out.

76
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.300
So refresh in both of your windows if you have multiple windows open.

77
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:46.110
And I'll open up the chat again in both browsers, and now if I say hello there and jump over to this

78
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.510
window, there's that message.

79
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.950
I can say hi, how are you?

80
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.080
You get the idea.

81
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.980
So now what we need to do, though, is instead of having hard coded photos of everyone in the world

82
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.760
looking like barks a lot with their username and avatar, we need to actually pull in based on the current

83
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.540
user session data, the relevant or current user name and avatar for that individual message.

84
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.060
Let me show you how I would begin to set that up back in our text.

85
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.950
Ed, I want you to jump in to our app.

86
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.330
Just file down towards the bottom of Apgar's.

87
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:31.710
We see this socket IO code that we wrote and write below this line where we say const IO equals and

88
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.160
then we require in and IO right below that line.

89
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.340
Let's add a new line.

90
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.170
Now the next 60 seconds or so are not going to be very educational.

91
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.020
So this code is not worth memorizing.

92
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:51.270
This is just the result of me researching through the documentation for the express session package

93
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.960
and learning how to integrate it with the socket IO package.

94
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.040
So let's do this.

95
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.630
Let's say I o dot use and that's a method.

96
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:06.450
So it gets parentheses and now we're going to give it a function that it will run any time there's a

97
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:14.130
new transfer of data function, parentheses, curly brackets within the parentheses for this function,

98
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.600
let's give it to parameters.

99
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.320
We could name them anything but let's name them socket comma and then let's name the second parameter

100
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.460
next.

101
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:33.750
OK, now within the body of this function, let's say session options parentheses, you might remember

102
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.660
that this is something we set up towards the top of this file.

103
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.580
But within these parentheses, we're going to give it three arguments.

104
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:50.330
So socket dot request, comma, socket dot request dot, RSS, comma.

105
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.760
And then finally next again, this code is not worth memorizing.

106
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.750
Essentially, it's just making our express session data available from within the context of socket

107
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.240
IO.

108
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.000
So now check this out.

109
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:13.020
This is how we're going to leverage this within this area where we say Io dot on Conexion.

110
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.820
I actually want you to cut these three lines of code into your clipboard.

111
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.510
So I'm going to begin selecting this line that says socket dot on chat message from browser and just

112
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.240
select these three lines like this again.

113
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.010
Be sure to cut that into your clipboard instead of just outright deleting it.

114
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.710
We're going to want to paste it in again in just a moment.

115
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.020
What I want to do here is create an if statement.

116
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:45.750
So if parentheses, curly brackets and for the condition, I want to say only if you're logged in.

117
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.700
Right.

118
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:53.550
Only if the Web browser that has opened a socket connection, only if they are actually logged in.

119
00:09:54.150 --> 00:10:02.370
So within these if parentheses, we can just say socket dot request dot session dot user.

120
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.480
Now within the if curly brackets, this is where we are safe to paste back in our clipboard.

121
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:09.990
Cool.

122
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.560
So now the only way we are actually going to acknowledge a chat message being sent from a browser is

123
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.650
if it's coming from a browser with logged in user session data.

124
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.840
Perfect.

125
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.810
Now let's take things one step further within this.

126
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.160
If block right above this socket online, let's add a new line.

127
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.970
Let's create a variable that will save us a bit of typing.

128
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:43.760
Let's say let user equal socket dot request, dot session dot user.

129
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:50.310
So remember, whatever a user logs in, we're storing basic things in session data, things like their

130
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.980
user name, their user ID and their avatar.

131
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.380
So check this out.

132
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.860
Look how we can leverage this.

133
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:02.280
Now, when a chat message comes in from the browser, then we are sending it out to any and all other

134
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.570
connected browsers.

135
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.550
At the moment, we're just sending an object with one property of message.

136
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.700
But check this out right after data dot message.

137
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.680
Let's add a comma and let's add another property named username.

138
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.660
So username Colen.

139
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.070
And then we can just leverage this piece of session data.

140
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.580
So we named it user.

141
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.280
So username, Kolan user dot username.

142
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.070
Let's also add another property that will contain their avatar.

143
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.470
So Kharma Avatar, Kolan User Dot Avan.

144
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:44.000
Ah, so now when we're broadcasting this data out to any and all browsers, not only does it include

145
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.620
the message, but it has the relevant username and avatar.

146
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.880
Let's go ahead and save this.

147
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:55.600
And now let's leverage those username and avatar values within our front end JavaScript.

148
00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:02.600
So jump back into Chat Jass and within our display message from server method.

149
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.230
Remember, this is the HTML template we paste it in.

150
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:11.160
Well, now we can get rid of the hardcoded avatar and username.

151
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.820
Let's start with the avatar.

152
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.430
So here we see image with a class of Avatar tiny.

153
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.660
Let's hollow out the source attributes value.

154
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.770
So just get rid of this https until the closing quote.

155
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:32.810
So now within the quotes we can just say dollar sign, curly brackets, data dot avatar.

156
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.210
OK then let's also hollow out this hardcoded username.

157
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:46.300
So keep the colon but get rid of Bachs a lot and say dollar sign curly brackets data dot username.

158
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.770
Cool.

159
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.570
Let's go ahead and save this and test it out.

160
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:57.750
So be sure to refresh any and all connected browsers and then I will also reopen the chat feature.
