00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.570
Hello, everyone, in this lesson, we are going to begin working on our chat feature, let's jump right

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.470
into the action.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.030
When I logged in user clicks on this chat icon up in the header bar, I would want to display a chat

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.120
box down in the bottom right corner of the screen.

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.800
Now, we can actually break this chat feature up into two parts.

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.840
Part one is just user experience and visual design.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.680
Right.

8
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.140
We just need to respond to the click event of this icon and then show the HTML and success that will

9
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.390
build the chat box interface.

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.170
That's what we're going to focus on in this first part of the lesson in the next video, we can work

11
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.150
on the actual technology that will allow for two way communication of data in real time.

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.610
OK, but right now, let's begin working on the user experience aspect.

13
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.950
Let me show you where I would begin.

14
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:09.060
So in your text editor, within your views folder, I want you to look in the includes subfolder and

15
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.960
I want you to jump into footer SJS right below the closing footer tag.

16
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.530
And right above all these scripts, I want you to add a new line and let's write an if statement to

17
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.750
see if the current visitor is logged in.

18
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.560
Right.

19
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.750
Because we only want the chat feature to be available if you are logged in.

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.920
So to begin, let's drop in to SJS and let's say if parentheses, curly brackets and for the condition

21
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.710
in the parentheses, we can just say user.

22
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.890
Now, within the if block, we'd want to include a bit of HTML for the chat feature.

23
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.190
So at the end of this line, let's be sure to drop out of Ejaz.

24
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.450
And then at the start of this line, let's jump back into SJS.

25
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.070
And now on this line, we are free to include a bit of HTML.

26
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.910
Let's create a div.

27
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.760
So opening and closing div tag and on the opening tag, let's give it an I.D. So ID equals quotes of

28
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.590
chat Dasch wrapper.

29
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.980
OK, and then for styling or design reasons, let's also give it a few classes.

30
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.110
So class equals quotes and then type these classes out with me.

31
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.830
So chat Dasch wrapper space.

32
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.880
Shadow space border.

33
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.800
Top space border left space border.

34
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.370
Right.

35
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.410
OK, and that's it.

36
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.000
There is no actual content in between the opening and closing div tags.

37
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.740
We can add that on the fly a bit later with browser based JavaScript.

38
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.510
For now, let's go ahead and save this file and now let's go create a new browser based JavaScript file

39
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.760
that is dedicated to the chat feature.

40
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.390
We already have a dedicated folder where we can do this.

41
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.590
So from the root of your project, look for the folder that is named Front End Dash G.S. and then look

42
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.480
within the modules folder.

43
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.310
You should see that this is where we already have created search dogs.

44
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.000
So let's just create another new file in this modules folder.

45
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.570
So if I.

46
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.740
Right.

47
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.510
Click on modules, choose new file, I will name the new file chat JS within this brand new file.

48
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.310
Let's set up a general skeleton.

49
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.490
So we'd want to export something so that this code is available from our main JavaScript file.

50
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:48.360
So let's say export default class and then let's say uppercase chat and then curly brackets within these

51
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.110
curly brackets.

52
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.090
Let's include a constructor.

53
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.340
So constructor parentheses, curly brackets for now in the constructor.

54
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.610
Let's just include an annoying alert pop up that says chat feature is loading.

55
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.780
OK, now below the constructor, but still within the overall curly bracket for the class.

56
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.470
Let's include a comment and say events so we can just create a method with the name of event.

57
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.330
So events, parentheses, curly brackets and then below events.

58
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.300
Let's also include a comment that says methods.

59
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.460
OK, before we save this, let's be sure to call the events method within the constructor.

60
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.150
So in the constructor, I would just add a line and say this dot events parentheses to call it cool.

61
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.130
Let's go ahead and save this file.

62
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.220
And now let's jump into our main JS file and import this file.

63
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:52.290
So look within your front end dash JS folder and not inside the modules folder, but just inside front

64
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.920
SJS.

65
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.070
We see a file named Main JD.

66
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.250
Let's jump into that up at the very top.

67
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.470
Let's import in that new chat file.

68
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:11.180
So import uppercase chat from and then we just give it a file path, so quotes and then dot slash module's

69
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.740
slash chat.

70
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.800
OK, now down here, let's write an if statement to only leverage this if that Chhatrapati exists in

71
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.390
the footer or page template.

72
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.140
Right.

73
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.020
That if statement that we just set up in the footer this way we only bother executing the chat JavaScript

74
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.690
if a visitor is logged in.

75
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.830
So I would just write an if statement.

76
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:43.850
So if parentheses curly brackets for the condition I would just say if document dot query selector that

77
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:51.950
gets its own set of parentheses and then quotes and then to look for an idea, just say hash tag chadash

78
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.560
wrapper.

79
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.380
So this will only evaluate to true if that element exists.

80
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.680
OK, and then in the curly brackets for the if block I would just say let's create a new instance of

81
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.870
uppercase chat.

82
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.110
Cool.

83
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.940
Let's go ahead and give this a save.

84
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.130
And now as long as your NPM run watch task is running, that should automatically create a new updated

85
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.760
bundle JavaScript file.

86
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.090
So back in the browser, if I refresh, I should see that annoying alert.

87
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.880
Yep.

88
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.710
Chat feature is loading.

89
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.970
Perfect.

90
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.980
Next, let's use browser based JavaScript to add a bit of HTML into that empty chat div that lives in

91
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.450
the footer.

92
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.810
Let me show you what I mean.

93
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.740
So within our footrot file, remember, if the users logged in there is a div, but for the time being

94
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.970
it's completely empty.

95
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.750
There's nothing in between the opening and closing div tags.

96
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.230
So let's do this within our new chat JS file within the constructor.

97
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.570
Let's get rid of this test alert message and instead let's create a property.

98
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.890
Let's say this dot chat wrapper equals and then let's select that empty div.

99
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:15.260
So document query selector quotes and then hash tag chat wrapper.

100
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.150
Remember hash tag is how you can select an element based on its IDE, whereas a dot is how you can select

101
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.770
element based on its class.

102
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.960
OK, now right below this line, let's call a method that doesn't exist yet, but we can create it in

103
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.920
just a minute or two.

104
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.420
So let's say this dot inject each HTML.

105
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:42.380
OK, now down in our methods area, let's just create a method with that matching name so we can just

106
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:49.610
say inject html parentheses, curly brackets within the body of this method.

107
00:07:49.610 --> 00:08:02.000
Let's just say this dot chat wrapper dot inor each html equals and then let's include back ticks within

108
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.870
the two back ticks.

109
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.800
You're free to drop down and I'll push enter once again.

110
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.270
So we have an empty line here.

111
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.350
All right.

112
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:15.770
And now instead of typing out a bunch of HTML with you, let's actually just copy and paste a bit from

113
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.180
a file up on GitHub.

114
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.070
So within the same repository that we've been working with throughout this course.

115
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.580
Right.

116
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:31.820
GitHub, dotcom, slash, learn web code, slash JavaScript, dig into the O2 complex app folder and

117
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.150
then go into the O1 HTML templates folder.

118
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.840
And right now the file that we're interested in is Chat Dasch Visible HTML.

119
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:50.180
From here you can click on the raw button to see just the text for this file and then we want to scroll

120
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.320
down towards the bottom.

121
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.380
So here we see an HTML comment that reads Chat feature begins.

122
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.880
We already have this div with an idea of chat wrapper, but look right below that line of code here

123
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.390
we see a div with the class of chat title bar and then it says chat and it has a span.

124
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:17.750
I want you to select this entire line into your clipboard, so let me copy that.

125
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.450
And then for your reference, if I go back a page.

126
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.880
Within this view of GitHub, you can see the line that I'm referring to is line number fifty nine.

127
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.020
That's what I want you to copy into your clipboard, OK?

128
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:38.090
And then back in our text editor within the two back ticks, let's just paste in our clipboard.

129
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.710
OK, now, below this.

130
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:45.130
I do want you to include a few more lines of HTML, so manually type this out with me.

131
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:53.330
Let's say div opening and closing div tag, and I want you to give the opening tag an idea of simply

132
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.080
chat.

133
00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:00.000
And then I also want you to give it a class of Chadash log.

134
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.770
So this is where all the actual chat messages will get added.

135
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.610
OK, now below this div let's add a form.

136
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:14.750
So this will include the text field that you actually type your messages into the form contains a decent

137
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.740
bit of HTML.

138
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.820
So instead of typing this out by hand, let's actually dig back into that file and GitHub.

139
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:29.420
So within this template on GitHub, if you look around line number five, you will see an opening form

140
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.730
element and it goes from eighty five down to line number eighty seven.

141
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.990
So I just want you to select those three lines of code into your clipboard.

142
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.660
Go ahead and copy that back in your text editor.

143
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.680
Go ahead and paste.

144
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.850
Cool.

145
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.560
If you need to pause the video for a moment just to make sure that your HTML looks like this, that's

146
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.040
OK.

147
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.090
But at this point, let's go ahead and save this file and reload in the Web browser.

148
00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:02.630
So refresh now we do not see the chat box visually yet, but if you write, click anywhere on the Web

149
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:10.220
page and choose, inspect and then in your developer tools, look for the footer element right below

150
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.120
the footer element.

151
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.390
We see a div with an idea of chat wrapper.

152
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:22.610
Now, just as a test, if I double click on the value for its class attributes and then at the start

153
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:30.190
of this value, if I give it a class of maybe chat dash dash visible and then push enter.

154
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:31.750
Well look at that.

155
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.350
Now the chat is visible.

156
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:39.440
Now, obviously we don't expect the visitors of our website to manually go into their web dev tools

157
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.060
and add a class like that.

158
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:46.850
But we now have an idea of what we can do when the user clicks on this chat icon in the header.

159
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.180
So let me refresh again to hide the chat box.

160
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:56.300
So let's jump back into our JavaScript file and set things up so that when the user clicks on this chat

161
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.960
icon, we add that visible class to the chat wrapper.

162
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:07.700
So back in our text editor within Chat JS, let's scroll up to the very top and within our constructor,

163
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.610
let's select that icon up in the header.

164
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:22.400
So I will say this dot open icon and set that equal and then document dot query selector and it has

165
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:29.000
a class so dot it has a class of header dash chadash icon.

166
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:37.190
OK, now within our events area, let's just set up a listener that listens for that icon getting clicked

167
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.460
on.

168
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:47.390
So within our events method we can just say this dot open icon dot add event listener.

169
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.430
This takes two arguments.

170
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:55.100
So Akama be the first argument instead of this, a placeholder would be the event that we are listening

171
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.520
for.

172
00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:02.210
In this case, it's a click event and then instead of the B placeholder, this is a function that we

173
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.830
would want to run in response.

174
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.470
So let's get rid of this placeholder B and let's actually begin with an arrow function.

175
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.140
So parentheses arrow symbol.

176
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.630
And if we're on the same line, we don't need curly brackets and this method doesn't exist yet, but

177
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.190
we can create it in just a moment.

178
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:27.590
So let's call this dot show chat parentheses to actually call that method OK.

179
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:32.840
And now down in our methods area, let's create a method with this name show chat.

180
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.450
So down here I would just say show chat, parentheses, curly brackets.

181
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:49.940
And within the body of this method, I'd just say this dot chat wrapper, dot class list, dot add and

182
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.700
I'd give it a class of chat, dash dash visible.

183
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.680
So that's two dashes.

184
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.070
Let's give this a save and go test it out.

185
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.860
So back in the browser be sure to refresh.

186
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.950
And now when I click the chat icon up in the header perfect.

187
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.540
It opens the chat box.

188
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:19.700
Next lets set things up so that when I click on this x right here it closes or hides the chat box.

189
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.230
So back in our.

190
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:28.910
Ed, up at the very top of this file within our constructor, let's create a property for that close

191
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.440
icon.

192
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:36.650
So this dot close icon equals document dot query selector.

193
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:45.320
And I can let you know that it has a class of so dot to select the class and its chat dash title.

194
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.590
Dash Bardash close.

195
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.490
OK, now let's set up an event listener for that element.

196
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.250
So within our events area, let's add a new line.

197
00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:00.500
Let's say this dot close icon dot add event listener.

198
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.330
We're going to give it to arguments.

199
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:08.480
The first argument is the event that we're listening for, which is click and then the second argument

200
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.230
is a function.

201
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:15.230
Now to recap the reason I'm going to use an arrow function here is because I do not want to modify that

202
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.100
this keyword.

203
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.650
I still want this to point towards our object, not the element that got clicked on.

204
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.660
And remember, an arrow function does not modify that this keyword.

205
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:31.160
So let's get rid of the placeholder, provide an arrow function, and then this method doesn't exist

206
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.370
yet.

207
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:38.400
But let's call this dot hyd chat parentheses to actually call that method OK.

208
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:44.630
Then down within our methods area, let's just create a new method to give it a name of hide chat,

209
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.930
parentheses, curly brackets, and then you can actually just copy and paste this line of code.

210
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.290
So select that copy, paste it here.

211
00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:01.190
The only difference is instead of adding that class so we want to change add to remove, we want to

212
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.180
get rid of that class that makes it visible.

213
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.290
Let's give this a save and then test it out.

214
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:12.080
So back in the browser, if I refresh, I can click this to open the chat and then I should be able

215
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.140
to click the X icon to hide the chat.

216
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.640
It's not working.

217
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.270
I think I know what the issue is back up at the very top of our chat JS file on this line of code within

218
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.420
the constructor when I'm trying to select that close icon.

219
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:33.890
Well, when this line of code runs, this element doesn't even exist yet because this method is what

220
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.810
injects that HTML.

221
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.250
So we just need to cut and paste this line to live below this line.

222
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:48.050
So cut the this close icon line into your clipboard and then just paste it right below.

223
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.230
When we call this dot inject HTML.

224
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.420
So new line and then just paste right here.

225
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.140
OK, let's give this save and test it out again.

226
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.800
So if I refresh the front end I can open the chat.

227
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.980
If I click this I can close the chat.

228
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:11.090
Now in our next video, we are going to work on the actual technology that will power the communication

229
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.350
of data for the chat.

230
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.120
But before we get to that, there's one more thing I want to do in this part of the lesson.

231
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:23.870
Let's set things up so that the first time the user opens the chat, a special function runs that can

232
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.580
open a connection to the server.

233
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:32.060
But then if a user just started spamming, closing and opening and closing and opening the chat, we

234
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.800
wouldn't want to create a new connection.

235
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:40.160
Each time the chat was opened, we'd only want to run that open connection function the first time they

236
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.060
open the chat.

237
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.390
Let me show you what I'm getting at and how I would set that up.

238
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:51.170
So in our text editor within our constructor, I would just create a property, maybe name it, this

239
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.750
dot opened yet and by default, let's set this to false.

240
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.860
OK, then let's find our show chat method.

241
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.830
And then within this method, let's write an if statement.

242
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.250
Let's say if parentheses curly brackets for the condition.

243
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:14.960
We can just say if this dot opened yet, let's check for the opposite of that.

244
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.230
So only if it's set to false would we want to do something in this case, let's call a method that doesn't

245
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.920
exist yet.

246
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.940
But let's say this dot open connection.

247
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:34.550
OK, then after the if block, let's add a new line and just set this dot opened yet to equal.

248
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:34.940
True.

249
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.080
So as soon as the chat is opened, this property is set to true.

250
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.940
But the very first time you open it, it will be set to false.

251
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.240
So this will actually run.

252
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.680
And then just as a test, we can create a method with this name of open connection.

253
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:54.950
So maybe down here let's create a brand new method, open connection, parentheses, curly brackets,

254
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.120
just as a test.

255
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.160
Let's create an alert pop up that says opening a connection.

256
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.540
Cool.

257
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.880
Let's go ahead and save this and test it out.

258
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:13.430
So if I refresh the very first time I open the chat box, I do see that annoying alert opening up connection.

259
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.580
But if I close the chat and then reopen it again, I do not see that alert each time.

260
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.840
Perfect.

261
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.830
This sets the stage for the next part of this lesson where we will open a connection to the server to

262
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.380
allow for two way communication of data.

263
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.650
This is going to be a lot of fun to set up.

264
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.250
So let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
