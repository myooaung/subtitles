00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,820
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,540
In this lesson, we are going to complete our live search feature without further ado, let's jump right

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,020
into it.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:18,930
OK, so at this point, a user can click on the search icon, search for a phrase, and currently we're

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,450
simply logging the results to the console.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,760
So our goal in this lesson is to use this resulting raw data and generate the appropriate HTML to actually

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,620
show results visually.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:38,310
Right here to get started, let's adjust our send request method so that once it receives its response

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,890
from the server, instead of just logging the data to the console, it can call a separate method that's

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,710
responsible for generating and rendering HTML.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,600
So in our text editor within Search Dogs, let's find our send request method.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,790
So here it is.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,220
Send a request and right below this console dot log, let's just add a new line.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,650
And we haven't created this method yet, but we will create it in about 20 seconds from now.

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:16,410
But let's just call this DOT Renderer results, html parentheses to call it.

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,240
And let's also pass into it response dot data.

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:20,960
Right.

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,560
That array of raw JSON data.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,450
Cool.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,630
Now we better go create a method with this matching name.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,180
So maybe right below our send request method we can just create a new one and say render results.

22
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,650
HTML parentheses, curly brackets within the parentheses less include a parameter, let's call it posts.

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,690
Right, because it's going to be an array representing one or multiple posts.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,920
Or if the array is empty, that means there are no results or no posts within this new method.

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,660
Let's begin with an if statement.

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,390
So if parentheses curly brackets, let's also include in the else block for the condition within these

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,080
parentheses.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:12,810
Let's just say posts dot length, meaning if the array has any items, even just one item, we would

29
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:20,610
want to display it or else that means there were zero results in either case within the if or the else,

30
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,620
we would want to manipulate the HTML for the results area div.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,310
So we've already created a property that points towards that div.

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:39,810
So we can just say this dot results area and then just look inside it for a property named inner HTML

33
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,210
and then we can set that to equal something.

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
For now, let's just include a placeholder X and we can circle back to this.

35
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,080
Let's do the same thing.

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,610
So just copy and paste that into the else block.

37
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,200
OK, now let's do this.

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,630
Let's scroll down into the HTML template for the search overlay.

39
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,440
So this is within our inject HTML method and we see two chunks of HTML separated by this line break

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:12,720
in the second chunk, about three lines down we see a div with a class of live Dasch search results.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,610
Let's go ahead and do this.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,830
Let's hollow out this div.

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,260
But before we just delete its contents right now, let's first copy them to our clipboard.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:30,930
So I want you to begin selecting from this div with the class of list dash group and shadow dash s.m.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,560
Begin selecting there and then scroll down.

46
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,820
You'll see several elements after the final AI.

47
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,690
Also select one of the closing div tags like this.

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,060
Go ahead and copy that into your clipboard and then you're free to delete it here.

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,710
OK, just to keep this a bit cleaner, we can move the closing div tag for this live search results

50
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,380
to sit on the same line as the opening tag.

51
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,710
So just delete this empty space.

52
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,760
Cool.

53
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,240
Now let's use our JavaScript to add appropriate HTML into this results div.

54
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,490
So let's scroll back up to our render results HTML method.

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,410
We just created this a moment ago, remember, it has the if and else if this is true, then there are

56
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,690
results to display.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,130
So we would just want to set the HTML for that results area to the code that's in our clipboard.

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,910
So get rid of the placeholder X in its place, include two back ticks and in between the two back sticks,

59
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,320
just paste in your clipboard, OK, within the else block.

60
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,850
If this is true, we'd want to set the HTML for that area.

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,620
Let's get rid of the X Factor X.

62
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,290
We want to set it to a paragraph element.

63
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:58,260
So opening and closing P tags and then let's just say sorry, we could not find any results for that

64
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,050
search just for style reasons.

65
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:11,080
On the opening P tag, let's give it an attribute named class and set its value to alert and alert Dasch

66
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,710
danger and text Dasch Center and maybe Shadow Daxam.

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,640
OK, now after the else block, but still within the overall closing curly brackets for this method.

68
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,460
So right here, let's do this.

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,690
Let's hide that spinning loader icon, right.

70
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,630
Because we have HTML that we're ready to show instead of the waiting icon.

71
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,420
So we can just say this dot hide loader icon parentheses to call that we have not actually created this

72
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,050
method yet.

73
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,880
We can create it in just a moment.

74
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,240
OK, and then right below that, let's reveal or show the results area, because until this code runs,

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,700
that div is set to be hidden or invisible.

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,450
But now that we've populated it with either the results HTML or the sorry message, it's ready to be

77
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,020
displayed.

78
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,080
So we can just say this dot show results area.

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,050
OK, now let's go set these two methods up.

80
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,090
So just a little bit below this, we see a method named Show Load or icon.

81
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:22,440
Let's just copy these same three lines of code to save typing and turn the new copy into Hyd Loader

82
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,480
Icon instead of show load or icon.

83
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,060
So take these three lines, duplicate them.

84
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,170
It's name this new one hyd loader icon.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:40,140
All we need to change is class list instead of add should be dot remove the class that makes it visible

86
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,490
right below this.

87
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,230
Let's also create methods that hide and show the results area respectively.

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,990
So let's say show results, area parentheses, curly brackets.

89
00:06:52,530 --> 00:07:03,420
So just be this dot results area dot class list and give it a class of live Dasch search dash results.

90
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,610
Dash dash visible.

91
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,730
OK, then to create the hide version of this we could just copy these three lines right below that,

92
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:21,210
paste it, change this new copy to B hide results area and then just change class list from dot add

93
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,340
to remove.

94
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,360
OK, before we save this and test it out, let's scroll up to our key press handler to make sure that

95
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,090
the right events are taking place at the right time.

96
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,720
So remember, towards the top of our methods area, we have a method named QI Press Handler.

97
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,850
Now if a user performs one search and the results appear and then they begin typing to perform a new

98
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:51,240
search, well, we not only want to show the loader icon again, but we also want to hide the results

99
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,170
area once again.

100
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,800
So this does not hide results area.

101
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,380
OK, and one last detail.

102
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,720
What if someone performs a search and then empties out the text field entirely?

103
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:04,860
Sure.

104
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,110
That changed the value of this field, but we wouldn't actually want to start running a search or showing

105
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,190
this loading icon.

106
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,030
We want to hide the icon and hide the results area.

107
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:22,170
So within key press handler right above this if statement, let's just set up another if statement and

108
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:30,060
say if parentheses curly brackets for the condition if value equals nothing.

109
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,680
If this is the case, let's clear or reset our timer.

110
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,420
So clear.

111
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,580
Time out, time out.

112
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,820
We want to clear is this not typing.

113
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,530
Wait timer.

114
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,480
After that we'd want to hide both the lower icon and the results.

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:57,630
So this dot hide loader icon and this dot hide results area.

116
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,740
OK, let's go ahead and save this and test it out.

117
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,500
So in the browser, be sure to refresh.

118
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,030
All right.

119
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,240
And if I perform a search for JavaScript.

120
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,230
Cool, obviously, we still need to make this dynamic content instead of the static HTML.

121
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,080
Don't worry, we'll get to that soon.

122
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,140
But if I start hitting backspace, you see the loading icon.

123
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,980
But if I get to an empty string of text, the loader icon goes away.

124
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm free to perform another search.

125
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,880
So success.

126
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,540
Cool, so things are working as expected, we just need to do two things.

127
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,230
Number one, let's set it so the delay is no longer three thousand milliseconds.

128
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,220
Let's set the delay to maybe seven hundred and fifty milliseconds, OK?

129
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,380
And then after that, let's adjust this so that it uses the raw data instead of this hard coded static

130
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,340
HTML for each link back in our text editor.
