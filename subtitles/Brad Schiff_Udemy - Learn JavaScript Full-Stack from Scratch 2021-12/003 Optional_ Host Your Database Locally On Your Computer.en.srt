00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,600
Right away, I want to emphasize that this video is optional.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,110
If you don't consider yourself an intermediate to advanced student, I recommend skipping this video.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,640
However, some of you may not want to sign up for the free MongoDB Atlas Cloud account that we set up

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,760
in the previous video, and you would rather host your database locally on your own computer.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,820
Now that does mean that you won't be able to push your applications up onto the web to share with your

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,870
friends and family.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,600
So if you do want to be able to share your apps, be sure that you use the Atlas Cloud approach from

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,560
the previous video.

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,590
So this video represents an alternate path.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,520
If you are OK with your apps in this course, just being for your own personal experiments and you're

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,980
the only one that can view them if you're OK with that and you would prefer to host your databases locally.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,680
Well, then this video will show you how to do that.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,860
To get started, we need to make sure that we have something called Docker installed on our computer,

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,980
so you can visit the official website Docker dot com, and in particular, we're looking for something

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,500
called Docker Desktop.

17
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,960
So if you look under products, here it is Docker desktop.

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,370
You click on that it is completely free to download and use.

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,370
So just choose the appropriate version for your computer.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,400
All of the default options should be great, so you can just click next next next through the installation

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,780
once your download finishes.

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:38,380
So feel free to pause this video lesson right now while you go and install Docker on your computer.

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,420
OK, but once you resume the video at this point, I'm going to assume that everyone now has Docker

24
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,740
installed on their computer.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,890
So up next in Udemy, you'll find a downloadable file for this video lesson called host Mongo locally

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,940
dot zip.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,600
So I want you to pause the video, go ahead and download the zip file.

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,520
When you extract it, you'll get a folder and it has just two files inside it.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,760
This Docker composed why HTML file?

30
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,910
This will configure Docker perfectly to spin up a MongoDB instance.

31
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,400
And then this other file connections drinker?

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,660
Well, we will need the value inside this file in just a minute.

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,930
But for now, we don't need to pay attention to either of these files.

34
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,500
What you need to do is point a command line towards this new folder that you extracted from the ZIP.

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,710
So you can see I have this folder open in vs code.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,600
So if you open your terminal well, then your command line will be pointing towards that folder.

37
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,510
And now you just need to run this one command with me.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,990
Docker compose up.

39
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,970
Go ahead and press enter.

40
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,700
And assuming that Docker is installed and up and running on your computer, that's really all we need

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,120
to do.

42
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,780
Now you will need to wait here, perhaps a minute or two.

43
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:03,130
I believe the download size is about 700 megabytes for the MongoDB image, but you'll know that things

44
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,510
are ready when you stop seeing a new constant stream of text in the command line.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,460
Cool.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,780
So this means that Docker is now hosting MongoDB locally on our computer.

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,160
Now the question becomes How do we actually connect to it or view it?

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,400
Well, there is an excellent free tool officially from MongoDB called Compass.

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,180
So from the MongoDB website, or, you know, you can just perform a Google search for MongoDB Compass.

50
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,150
Go ahead and download now it's a free download and then come back and resume this video.

51
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,320
Once you have MongoDB Compass installed, when you open MongoDB Compass, the application will look

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,710
something like this and you can see here to connect to a database, you provide a connection stream.

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,320
Now this is that text file that I provided for you in the folder.

54
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,980
So remember when we downloaded that zip a couple of minutes ago?

55
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:07,390
If you jump into the connections, drinks, text file, just select this value control or command.

56
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,650
Select the entire thing.

57
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,510
Copy it into your clipboard.

58
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,050
And then back in MongoDB Compass.

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,860
In this field, just paste in your clipboard and click Connect.

60
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,450
From this screen, let's use the Green Create database button.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,270
So we've connected to a database server, but you can have as many databases on that server as you want.

62
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,530
So maybe let's name this database example and let's have a collection name of items.

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,150
And then down at the very bottom, it's falling off the edge of my screen, but there's a green create

64
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,930
database button.

65
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,620
You can click that cool and now you see example database from here.

66
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:55,180
This interface is almost identical to the MongoDB Atlas Cloud account screens that you'll see throughout

67
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,960
the videos.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,320
In other words, if you click on this collection of items.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,090
Well, this screen is going to look.

70
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,490
Virtually identical to these screens throughout the course when you see me working with a database in

71
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,600
my web browser.

72
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,690
So you should be able to follow along quite nicely.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,670
Now when it comes to connecting a node J.S. application to this database.

74
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,820
Well, again, that's what your connection string is for.

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,440
So if you take a look at your connection string after the root root, local host and the port number

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,160
and then a slash, you see this your name here, you would simply change that to the specific database

77
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,170
that you want to work with.

78
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,210
So we just created a database called example.

79
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,270
So you would change this to be example, and then you would use this entire connection string within

80
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,600
your Node.js code files to connect to the database.

81
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,380
However, don't worry about getting too many steps ahead of yourself.

82
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:57,220
For now, you have a MongoDB database up and running locally, and that's really all we need to accomplish

83
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,120
in this video.

84
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,400
So now you can continue to follow the course step by step.

85
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:08,380
Only in a future VIDEO When I say, you know, use your MongoDB Atlas Cloud account connection string.

86
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,600
Well, obviously instead, you would use this as your connection stream really quick.

87
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,660
Let's talk a little bit more about Docker.

88
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,800
So in the command line, if you click down there, you can press control, see, and that will stop

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,780
your Docker container from running.

90
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,930
Now, if you want to start it up again, you use a different command.

91
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,420
So we used Docker compose up.

92
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:34,750
That's just what you run the very first time to sort of create things, but you only run it that one

93
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,590
time initially.

94
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,950
So now to start your database server up again, it's Docker compose start.

95
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,660
Go ahead and press enter.

96
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,630
And now it's just running in the background.

97
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,970
So Control C wouldn't stop it.

98
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,110
Now, if you wanted to stop it, you would say Docker compose stop.

99
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,120
Now those commands are the same thing as just going into your Docker desktop application.

100
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,310
Here you can see host Mongo locally, and instead of saying Docker compose start, you can just click

101
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,050
this play or start button.

102
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,570
OK, and then once it's running instead of Docker Compose Stop, you can just click this button.

103
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:12,870
Cool.

104
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,330
That is going to bring this video to a close.

105
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,040
Let's keep our momentum rolling.

106
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,750
And I'll see you in the next one.
