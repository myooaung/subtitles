00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.850
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.150
In this lesson, we are going to talk about where we go from here or what's next.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.250
So we just completed our to do application and it was a lot of fun to put together it.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.760
Let us practice sewing the three big JavaScript environments together, the browser, the server and

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.660
the database.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.480
But no example project is perfect.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.440
So right now I want to talk about the three biggest things that this application is missing that we

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.830
still need to learn about.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.160
Number one is organization number two is unique data per user and number three is attention to detail.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.980
Now, don't worry, we're going to go through each of these one by one and explain what I mean.

11
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.730
Let's start with number one organization.

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.210
So our to do app project had zero organization.

13
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.680
It really only had two files, right?

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860
Server, J.S. and browser.

15
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.830
Yes.

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.310
And our server JS file was a complete mess.

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.270
Just within this one file, we had our basic server set up.

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.810
We had our git and post routes, we had our HTML template, we had our database code.

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.710
And all of these things were just messily squished into this one unruly file.

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.860
Now, we were able to get away with this unorganized approach because our to do app was a very small

21
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.390
and simple application.

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.130
However, once an app has any sort of complexity to it, we really need to start organizing and splitting

23
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.900
each task or responsibility into its own separate file.

24
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.470
Otherwise, our project will turn into a mess of tangled up spaghetti code and we'll end up with something

25
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.050
that is almost impossible to maintain.

26
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.610
So we definitely still need to learn about code organization.

27
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.050
Let's move on to number two unique data per user.

28
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.400
So this is referring to the fact that in order to do application, we only had one user account, right?

29
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.300
We set up that basic password protection feature.

30
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.060
However, anyone who actually accesses this application is working with the same data.

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.140
It's almost like you're all sharing one account.

32
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.610
This was fine just for a bit of practice.

33
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.540
But in the real world, you'll want to let visitors register for their own account and you'll want to

34
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
let them create data that is unique to their account.

35
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.370
Right.

36
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.310
And then when they log in, they would only see items or data from their account.

37
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.280
So we absolutely still need to learn how to set up unique data per user.

38
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.240
All right.

39
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.320
And number three is attention to detail.

40
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.380
This could refer to many things, but primarily what I'm talking about is having complex logic based

41
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.860
on user input, meaning if the user type something in, we want to be able to decide if they typed too

42
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.940
little or too much or if we ask them for an email address.

43
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.770
Was it a valid email address?

44
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.510
When they choose a password, can we make sure that their password contains enough characters?

45
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.360
Can we send back the appropriate messages to the browser user so they can see what mistakes they made,

46
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.920
so on and so forth?

47
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.250
Basically what I mean by attention to detail is when you're developing an application, you need to

48
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.370
think of every possible thing that could go wrong and then you need to prepare for that.

49
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.670
Your application should be able to withstand that.

50
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.660
So my attention to detail, I mean, data validation, showing the user validation, error messages,

51
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.630
general security, so on and so forth.

52
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.500
OK, so those are the three biggest things that are to do.

53
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.580
App was missing.

54
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.860
You might be thinking to yourself, if the to do app was missing all of these important things, why

55
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.910
did we even bother building it at all?

56
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.680
Well, it's simple because now none of the following things are completely brand new are terrifying

57
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.220
to us.

58
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.190
So thanks to our to do app, we are now at least a little bit familiar with using the Web browser to

59
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:23.070
send requests to a server using Express to create a server that listens for incoming requests and performing

60
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.140
CRUD actions on a database.

61
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.950
So now we can learn about new technologies and concepts without overloading our brains with too many

62
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.210
new things at once.

63
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.270
Right, because these three things are no longer new to us, because when it comes to the three big

64
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.940
things that we still need to learn, what these three things have in common is that they can be incredibly

65
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.300
frustrating when you're still trying to learn the absolute basics of the browser, the server and a

66
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.050
database.

67
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.740
Right.

68
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.260
When you just want to see how the big JavaScript environments work together, the last thing you want

69
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.350
to be doing is creating thirty different separate file.

70
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.600
In the name of organization or when you just want to learn how to save user input data into a database,

71
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.710
the last thing you want to have to worry about is sessions and cookies or JSON Web tokens and hashing

72
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.970
passwords or when you just want to actually finish an application that the general public will never

73
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.030
actually visit.

74
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.690
The last thing you want to have to worry about is thinking of every possible way they could fill out

75
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.230
the form incorrectly or try to take advantage of your app.

76
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.770
Now, all of these things that I just mentioned are necessary, but can be very frustrating if you try

77
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.510
to learn them too early on.

78
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.890
So hopefully app no one prepared us with the basics.

79
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.130
So now we can avoid some of the common frustration of tackling these topics.

80
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.070
In other words, now that we are familiar with these things, we can now burden ourselves with these

81
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.680
things.

82
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.550
So back to the real question of this lesson.

83
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.050
What's next?

84
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.380
Well, the answer is app number two.

85
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.310
App number two is much more complex than our to do app.

86
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.550
And it does cover the three big things that our first app was missing.

87
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.730
So it's definitely organized.

88
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.060
We will learn how to split our code up into separate files so that each file only really has one main

89
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.080
responsibility.

90
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.190
App number two also has unique data per user.

91
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.030
So you see here you can register for a new account up here.

92
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.610
You can log in or out of an existing account.

93
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.390
Once you are logged in, you are presented with a unique feed of posts from the people that you follow

94
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:47.360
or the accounts that you follow, or you can visit your profile to see all of the posts that you have

95
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.410
created so far.

96
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.420
So that's unique data per user.

97
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.820
And finally, this application also has attention to detail.

98
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.520
For an example, back to user registration.

99
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.730
If you try to choose a username that is already in use, you'll see a validation message.

100
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.640
That username is already taken.

101
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.490
If you try to type in an email address that is not a valid email, you see another validation message.

102
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.760
So the idea is that anywhere on this website where we are receiving user input, we are going to validate

103
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.370
that input both from a commonsense standpoint and from a security standpoint.

104
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.300
All right.

105
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.230
So big picture, app number two absolutely includes those three big things that we still need to learn

106
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.560
about.

107
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:40.460
And in our very next lesson, we are going to begin work on this brand new project together.

108
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.550
This is going to be a lot of fun because this is where all of our preparation and practice really comes

109
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.250
together into a real world project.

110
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.830
Throughout the course of building this app together, I think you're going to have many different aha

111
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.520
moments.

112
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.650
So let's keep our momentum rolling.

113
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.350
I'm so excited to start this new project with you and I will see you in the next lesson.
