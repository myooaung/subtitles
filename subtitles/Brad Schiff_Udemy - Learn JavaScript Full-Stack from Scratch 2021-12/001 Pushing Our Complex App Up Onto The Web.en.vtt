00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.050
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.930
In this lesson, we are going to push our complex app up onto the web.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.600
Now you might remember way back when we created our simple To-Do app that we used a platform named Heroku

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.730
to host our application.

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.660
So that's exactly what we're going to do again with our complex app, right?

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.160
So instead of our application only living on local host, on our personal computer, we want to deploy

7
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.430
it or push it up publicly so that our friends and family can visit it from where you are at.

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.130
So go ahead and visit Heroku dot com.

9
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.280
You might still be logged in or if it's been enough days or weeks since you completed the simple to

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.230
do app, just go ahead and log in once again to you or Heroku account.

11
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.340
OK, but once you are logged in to your Heroku account, you should see a dashboard that looks something

12
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.090
like this.

13
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.460
In my case, here, I can see the simple To-Do app that we created earlier in the course.

14
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.980
And right now, we just want to create a brand new project or app within Heroku.

15
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.160
So towards the top right corner of this screen, we see this new menu item.

16
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.420
If I click on that, we can then choose Create New App.

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.800
So go ahead and do this with me right now.

18
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.750
Create new app.

19
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.740
Choose a name for your app and remember this name is unique.

20
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.810
So if I choose something super generic like my app, you can see that that is not available, so you

21
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.010
need to come up with the unique name that no one on Heroku has ever used before.

22
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.400
So maybe I'll try complex app.

23
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.900
Cool.

24
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.130
That's available now.

25
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350
You'll need to come up with something slightly different.

26
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.630
Feel free to choose any name you want.

27
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.950
The name does not matter.

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.250
Choose your region and then let's click Create app.

29
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.210
OK, at this point, go ahead and leave this browser tab open.

30
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.390
But for now, we're going to switch over to our text editor.

31
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.590
You might remember when we pushed our simple to do app up to Heroku that we used a technology named

32
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.140
Gitte to transfer the files.

33
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.870
Well, as you might have guessed, we're going to use Git once again for this app or for this project.

34
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.330
Now, before we jump into the command line and create a git repo and commit our changes and push them

35
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.420
up to Heroku, we need to do a few things first.

36
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.220
So right now, I want to draw your attention to our Dot EMV file.

37
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.620
Go ahead and click on EMV.

38
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.340
So right now, this contains a few things.

39
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.440
It contains our connection string with a username and password for the MongoDB Atlas user.

40
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.220
It contains which port number we want to run on, and it contains our JSON web token secret.

41
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.740
Now, clearly, these values are vital to our application running successfully.

42
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.170
However, I absolutely do not want to send this file along with our other files to Heroku, right?

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.300
Because the whole point of environment variables is that they are unique, or at least they have the

44
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.090
chance to be unique for each environment.

45
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.070
Right.

46
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.740
So maybe on local host, yes, I want to run on Port three thousand, but on Heroku, I want our application

47
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.590
to use whatever port number Heroku wants to use.

48
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.390
So here's what I'm going to do.

49
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.690
I am specifically not going to include this dot EMV file in my git repository.

50
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.170
Instead, I'm going to go into the Heroku dashboard and manually add the environment variables that

51
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.340
we actually need.

52
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.430
So, for example, let's start with connection stream.

53
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.610
I want you to select your connection string value into your clipboard, so go ahead and copy it.

54
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.970
So that's just right after this equals sign.

55
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.610
So then begin selecting there and then select all the way to the end of the line and copy that into

56
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.360
your clipboard.

57
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.920
OK, now I want you to jump back to the Heroku dashboard and for the new project or app that you just

58
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.130
created, I want you to look for the Settings link.

59
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.010
So as of today, Settings is on the far right.

60
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.420
Go ahead and click on Settings and then from the Settings screen.

61
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.840
The second section here is named Config VARs.

62
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.550
Go ahead and click on this button that says Reveal config VARs.

63
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.780
OK.

64
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.330
Currently, we have not created any yet, but here you see fields for key and value.

65
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.100
So in this key field, I want you to type in in all capital letters, connection string.

66
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.900
And as you might have guessed in the value field, just paste in your clipboard.

67
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.750
OK, then go ahead and click Add.

68
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.640
Cool.

69
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.430
Now let's add another one for our JWT secret.

70
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.850
So back in our text editor, we don't need to move over.

71
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.680
Port equals three thousand.

72
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.640
We want our app to use whatever port number Heroku wants to use, but we do want to move over our JWT

73
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.210
secret.

74
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.880
So right after the equal sign for that, just copy your entire value into your clipboard.

75
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:19.670
Back in Heroku for the key type in all capitals JWT secret for the value.

76
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.780
Just paste in your clipboard and be sure to click Add.

77
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.860
Cool.

78
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.440
Now I do also want to mention that this is a great way to use different databases.

79
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.950
One for your local development copy and then a different database for your real production copy.

80
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.820
Cool.

81
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.250
At this point, let's jump back into our text editor.

82
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.630
And up next, before we create a git repo within our project directory, I first want to create a git

83
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.850
ignore file and tell our repo to ignore our Dot EMV file.

84
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.400
So within the root of the project, just right click and choose new file.

85
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.290
The name of this file needs to be exact.

86
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.940
So it begins with a dot and then it's Git and that's git with an eye as in the version control system.

87
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.090
So git and then ignore within this new Dot Get Ignore file.

88
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.370
Let's begin by saying Dot EMV lets drop down.

89
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.610
I also do not want to include the node modules folder within our repo that would just be a waste of

90
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.870
bandwidth in space.

91
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.930
So let's say node underscore modules.

92
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.020
There's no need to keep this folder in your repo because as long as you have your packaged JSON file,

93
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.390
well, remember, that's sort of your recipe, right?

94
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.440
It keeps a running list of all the packages or ingredients that you need.

95
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.220
Now, every time you push to Heroku, the Heroku service is going to look within our packaged JSON file

96
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.680
and automatically download and install all of our packages or dependencies.

97
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.890
So we definitely don't need to include them in the repo.

98
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.770
OK, let's go ahead and save this doc.

99
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.910
Get Ignore file.

100
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.190
And now we just have one more step.

101
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.680
Before we are ready to send our files over, we need to make sure that Heroku knows how to initially

102
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.170
start or launch our application.

103
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.310
To do that, we just jump in to our packaged JSON file.

104
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.220
And in this scrips area, we need to make sure that we have a script or task named Start.

105
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.590
It needs to be that exact name.

106
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.560
So right about here I would just say quotes start colon quotes.

107
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.340
Be sure to include a comma at the end.

108
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.950
And then what do we want to include for the actual command?

109
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.410
Well, we don't want to use Node Mod. We don't want the server randomly restarting, so we would just

110
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.030
use node itself.

111
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.780
So node space and then the file that we launch is debugging.

112
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.280
Yes.

113
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.620
Let's give this file a save.

114
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.640
OK, and next, we want to push our files up onto the web, but not to Heroku directly.

115
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.120
While you can do that using Roku's CLI tool.

116
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.750
It's a lot more complicated than just pushing our files to GitHub and then connecting your GitHub account

117
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.070
to your Heroku account.

118
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.330
If you don't know how to push your files to a GitHub repo, that's OK.

119
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:16.940
Back in our simple crud application chapter of this course, we walked through how to use GitHub desktop.

120
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.220
Step by step.

121
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.590
So if you need to, you can go back and watch that video from that earlier chapter, or you can use

122
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.980
command line git whatever you're comfortable with.

123
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.980
But essentially you just want to push these files to a new private GitHub repository.

124
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.940
So feel free to pause this video lesson while you go and set that up.

125
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.880
For example, off camera.

126
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.890
I just set up this private repo called complex app, so these are all the same files we've been working

127
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.780
on and creating together.

128
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.270
They exist on my GitHub account.

129
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.610
So now you just want to go back into Heroku from this Heroku project you set up at the start of this

130
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:54.940
video.

131
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.500
Let's click on Deploy.

132
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:02.350
If we scroll down just a little bit, we want to use this option here where it says deployment method.

133
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.540
We want to connect to GitHub.

134
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.260
If you're clicking this for the very first time on this Heroku account, GitHub will need your permission

135
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.450
in order to let Heroku access it.

136
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.260
So be on the lookout for that potential pop up.

137
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.410
Do you give it permission?

138
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.720
And then down here you can just search for whatever you named your GitHub repository.

139
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.690
In my case, I named it complex app.

140
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.310
So if I search for that, yep, that's the one I'm interested in.

141
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.280
So once you find your GitHub repo, just click Connect.

142
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.160
Cool from here.

143
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.690
Just scroll down a little bit.

144
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:44.170
I'm going to enable automatic deploys, so I'll click that and then finally, scroll down and we want

145
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.830
to perform this initial first time deploy manually.

146
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.560
So in the future, you don't need to ever click deploy again any time you push changes to your master

147
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.550
or main branch.

148
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.160
It will just automatically get redeployed.

149
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.090
But for this very first time, let's click Deploy Branch.

150
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.950
If you scroll down a little bit, you can see real time progress updates on what Heroku is doing, right,

151
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.870
so it's using your packaged JSON file to install all of the npm dependencies.

152
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.550
Cool, so it finishes.

153
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.800
Now you can use this view button right here, or you can always scroll back up to the top of this page

154
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.440
and use this open app link.

155
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.660
Go ahead and click on Open App.

156
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.280
Awesome.

157
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.590
Now, obviously your URL is going to be different than mine, so it's your unique app name and then

158
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.080
dot Heroku app dot com.

159
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.250
I strongly encourage you to share your URL with your friends and family after all of the hard work you've

160
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.630
put into this application.

161
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.560
There's no better feeling than sharing it with the people you care about.

162
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.580
Trust me, it'll make the accomplishment feel ten times more meaningful.

163
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.070
Encourage them to sign up for an account and even join you in the live chat feature.

164
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.330
So really quick just to test that everything's working, I will log in with my brand account.

165
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.190
OK, and then maybe in Mozilla Firefox, I'll log in with my barks a lot account.

166
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.230
Barks a lot.

167
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.520
And if I open up the chat in both Windows Hello.

168
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.690
Hi, I'm a dog.

169
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.980
Cool.

170
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.260
Everything is working perfectly.

171
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:33.090
If you made it this far in the course, congratulations, you have launched your first meaningful full

172
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.530
stack application.

173
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:41.370
The number of different technologies that you stitched together to create this experience is definitely

174
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.900
something that's worth celebrating.

175
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:50.730
And at the heart of all of this is the JavaScript language itself, which you now speak fluently.

176
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.270
Now there are a few additional lessons or videos in the course.

177
00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.090
But before we move on to those, I do encourage you to go celebrate a bit with the amount of time,

178
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.210
effort and attention to detail that you just put into this app.

179
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.950
You deserve a small break.

180
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.810
Savor this moment.

181
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.280
This is a big milestone.

182
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:14.880
Now coming up next, there's going to be one super quick video on how you would send e-mail from one

183
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.050
of your applications.

184
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.480
And then after that, there will be a quick video on next steps to take.

185
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.350
What should you learn next?

186
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.610
And also maybe a few quick career tips or just words of advice.

187
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.550
I'm so excited you made it this far, and I'm even more excited to see you in the next several lessons.

188
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.430
So let's keep things rolling, and I'll see you then.
