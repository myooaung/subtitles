00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,600
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:10,460
In this lesson, we are going to get started with Noad J.S. However, before we download and install

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,610
Node onto our computers, let's first ask ourselves what exactly is node?

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,210
So very early in the course, we learn that there are multiple environments in which we can speak the

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:30,830
JavaScript language, and each environment has its own unique made up words or slang or lingo that relate

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,010
to its super powers or abilities.

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,790
So the Web browser is a JavaScript environment and its special abilities include viewing web pages and

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,970
responding to user events like clicks and keyboard presses, so on and so forth.

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,510
Well, node is another JavaScript environment and its special abilities include things like being able

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,080
to create new files and folders on your computer, hard drive, being able to listen for incoming network

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,830
requests and much, much more.

12
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:11,540
In other words, the Web browser can do web browser ish things, whereas node is more open ended, node

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,270
can do general computer ish things.

14
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,540
For now, that's all we need to know about node.

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,610
So that's enough talk for now.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,910
Let's get to the action right now.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,760
Let's go ahead and download and install node onto our computers so we can get started using it.

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,680
So follow along with me.

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,010
Here is the official node web website.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,320
It's no just dot org.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,610
I will include a link to this website in the resources for this lesson.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,700
Or you can just perform a Google search for node J.S..

23
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,720
OK, from the website, we want to download it.

24
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,250
In my case it says download for Mac OS.

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,970
In your case it might say download for Windows or something similar.

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,290
Now the version numbers that you see in this video are going to be different when you actually visit

27
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:06,740
the website yourself, because Node is constantly releasing new updated versions of the software.

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,870
That's OK.

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,600
Your version number does not need to exactly match my version.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,010
No.

31
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,110
Now, there are two different download options that we see here, one with the absolute newest, latest

32
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,430
and greatest features and another one that is slightly older but is super reliable and stable and dependable.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,100
Either download link will work just fine.

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,380
You can't go wrong, but personally I usually recommend the long term support version.

35
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,380
So go ahead and click on that to begin the download.

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,040
Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, it could take a while.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,160
But once the download finishes, go into your computer's downloads folder and open up the install file,

38
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,720
all of the default options in the automated installer are OK.

39
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,270
So you should be able to just click next, next, next without any trouble.

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,740
So at this point, I'd recommend you pause the video lesson while you go and install node.

41
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,050
And once the installer is complete, you can come back and resume the video.

42
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,090
OK, our next step is to make sure that node was successfully installed.

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,950
To do this, we want to open up a command line on our computer.

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,200
If you have no idea what a command line is and what you're looking at right now on your screen, don't

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,500
worry.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,310
Don't panic.

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,120
That's OK.

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,700
I know from firsthand experience that when you first see a command line, it can be terrifying.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,770
But if someone's guiding you through things and holding your hand, it really doesn't need to be scary

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,480
whether we like it or not.

51
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:42,290
If we want to become a full stack developer, we absolutely need to use a command line.

52
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,210
There's just no getting around it.

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,400
So the question is, how do you open up a command line on your computer?

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,690
Well, it's going to be different depending on whether you're using Windows or Mac.

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,470
OK, so on Windows, you can open up the start menu and then just start typing on your keyboard, start

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,420
typing command prompt.

57
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,010
It should show up in the list of programs or applications, so go ahead and open it.

58
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,310
Or another way to get to the command line on Windows is to just hold down the windows, key on your

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,340
keyboard and simultaneously press the ARCHEY.

60
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:24,980
This will open up a run prompt and click into the run prompt field and type C and D and then push enter.

61
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,900
OK, so that takes care of windows.

62
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,310
If you're on Mac, simply look in your applications folder for another folder named Utilities.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,050
Inside the utilities folder, you will see an app named Terminal.

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,700
Terminal is the command line on Mac, so go ahead and open that up.

65
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,360
OK, at this point everyone should have a command line open.

66
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:55,610
Now I want you to type this in node and then a space and then dash or the minus sign.

67
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:55,910
Right.

68
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,040
And then V so node space dash V go ahead and push.

69
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:08,610
Enter and in response, your computer should output a version number of node, if you see something

70
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,160
similar to this, even if your numbers are different, that means you have successfully installed node.

71
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,360
Give ourselves a pat on the back if you do not see a version number after running node space dashboard

72
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,850
and instead you see something like unknown command or command not found.

73
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,870
That means there was a problem when you tried to install node.

74
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:37,530
If that's the case, you can try restarting your computer and then opening up the command line and trying

75
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,130
this again.

76
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,120
Or you could try running through the node installer file again.

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,890
Or you might need to do a bit of personal Google research.

78
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:54,510
I'd recommend searching for install node problem blank where blank is your operating system, because

79
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:01,500
there are unique potential issues that are slightly different for Windows seven, Windows eight, Windows

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,940
10, as well as the different versions of Mac OS.

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,060
There's also a lot of different personal variables as to why Node did not successfully install, such

82
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,700
as the antivirus software that you have running in the background or different security settings that

83
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,810
you have enabled on your computer, so on and so forth.

84
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:28,470
So unfortunately, there's no way for me to preemptively list solutions to all of the possible reasons

85
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,790
as to why Node didn't successfully install.

86
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,500
However, I will say this learning how to Google and perform research is a huge part of becoming a developer.

87
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,380
So if you were not able to install Node successfully on your first try, don't worry, you're not alone.

88
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,210
Whatever issue you're running into, someone else has already ran into that issue.

89
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,860
And that's the beauty of Google.

90
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,860
And as you're digging through Google results, I want you to be on the lookout for any stack overflow

91
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,210
dotcom results.

92
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,600
A common joke in the programming world is that developers get paid to Google and find answers to their

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,550
problems on stack overflow.

94
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:11,130
OK, now, at this point in the lesson, I'm going to assume that everyone has successfully installed

95
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,600
node if you're moving forward.

96
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,060
So let's get our hands dirty and get our first taste of node in the command line.

97
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,420
I want you to simply type node, no space, nothing else, just the word node and then push, enter

98
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,080
or return.

99
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,180
By doing that, we have now entered into an interactive node environment.

100
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,770
In other words, we can start speaking the JavaScript language and our computer will understand us so

101
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,010
we can say two plus two and push enter.

102
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,480
We see four.

103
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,780
This is very similar to earlier in the course when we first started to experiment with the Web browsers

104
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,500
console.

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,950
Basically right now we are in the node console, so we are free to speak the JavaScript language.

106
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:05,010
We could create a variable, say, let my favorite number equal ten push enter that gets stored in the

107
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,980
memory and then I can say seven plus my favorite number.

108
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,420
Push, enter.

109
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,010
We see seventeen.

110
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,240
Now what if instead of just simple JavaScript language features like this, we wanted to leverage nodes,

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,550
unique abilities and super powers.

112
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:30,300
For example, what if we want to create a server and listen for incoming network requests?

113
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,540
Well, doing that with node is relatively easy, but it's going to take more than just a single line

114
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,920
of code like this.

115
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,590
And if we're going to be writing more than just single line code examples, we really should be doing

116
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,930
our typing in a dedicated text editing program instead of the command line.

117
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,130
Just like earlier in the course when we moved from the Web browsers console into code pen so we could

118
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,530
write multiple lines of code easily.

119
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:05,580
Right now we are going to move from our command line into a text editing program.

120
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:12,690
Ultimately, the reason we are doing this is so we can begin to do actually interesting and complex

121
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,770
things with Nog.

122
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,980
If you're scratching your head right now and still not really seeing the point of node and you're not

123
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,060
sure what the goal of all of this is and why node is necessary, don't worry.

124
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,590
That's to be expected.

125
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,920
I think the bigger picture of what's going on is going to come into focus and become very clear over

126
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
the next several lessons.

127
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,930
Trust me, when we finally do something interesting with Node and we see how that can interact with

128
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,980
the Web browser and how the puzzle pieces fit together, you are going to have an unbelievable aha moment.

129
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,870
So let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.

130
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:59,400
Just a super quick note at the end here to exit the interactive node environment in your command line,

131
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,480
you can just press.

132
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:09,240
Control see twice, or if I jump back into the node console, another way of exiting node is just a

133
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,910
type dot exit.

134
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,860
It's not the end of the world if you don't exit node like this, but it should make closing your command

135
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,330
line window a bit easier.

136
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,230
All right.

137
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,420
I will see you in the next lesson.
