00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,710
In this lesson, we are going to get started learning about databases, we have two primary goals in

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,400
this lesson.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,270
Number one is to get our first look at a database.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,340
During this part of the lesson, I want you to relax and take your hands off the keyboard and mouse

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,430
and just observe, OK?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,650
Then after that, goal number two is for you to create your own new database.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,020
This goal is very hands on.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,590
And I will want you to follow along with me.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,700
But for right now, let's begin with goal number one and have our first look at a database.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,520
OK, so here is a database that I created off camera prior to filming this lesson.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,960
And let's use our imagination to picture that this database powers a pet adoption website or app.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,770
So naturally, this pets portion of the database stores all of the data about the different pets.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,400
So down here we can see that each white rectangle.

15
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,570
So here's one and here's another represents a pet.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,430
So this first pet has a name of fuzzy IT species is a cat and it's spayed or neutered.

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,660
Value is set to true.

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,300
If we look at the next pet in the database, we can see that its name is purs loud.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,370
It's also a cat, but it's spayed or neutered.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,810
Value is set to false.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,350
You can see the next one is a dog with the name of cuddles.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,270
And then a dog named Bella, so on and so forth, you get the idea.

23
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,600
Now, I only created eight pets in this simple example database, but you could imagine that a real

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,770
pet adoption website could have hundreds or even thousands of pets or animals.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,520
And this brings us to the other main point of having a database in the first place.

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,210
Not only does a database let you permanently store data like this, but once you start to have a lot

27
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:05,470
of data, it becomes super important to be able to dig through that data or work with the data in a

28
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,490
meaningful way.

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,170
Let me show you what I mean.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,360
So let's imagine that I only want to see the dogs in the database.

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,010
Now, do not worry about fully understanding what I'm about to type in.

32
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,810
You will learn about this later.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:28,840
But just as a quick example, I could say that the species should be set to dog and then if I run this

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,380
query.

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:38,630
Now, in the results area, we only see dogs, so you can start to imagine how this would be very useful

36
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,380
for a pet adoption website or application, right.

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,890
Someone opens up your app and says, I'm only interested in adopting a dog.

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,600
No other types of animal.

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,570
Or imagine if someone wanted to adopt the cat that's already been spayed or neutered.

40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,290
So behind the scenes, we can talk to our database and say that the species should be set to cat.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,550
And then also the spayed or neutered property should be set to true.

42
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,300
And then if I run that query.

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,950
You can see we only received two pet documents, right, Fuzzy, the cat that has been spayed or neutered

44
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,380
and whiskers the cat that has been spayed or neutered.

45
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,540
Now, neither of the last two examples have been very impressive because there's only eight total pets

46
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,380
in our database.

47
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,460
But imagine if our database had five hundred thousand pets.

48
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,270
In that case, being able to run queries like this and dig through the data is incredibly powerful and

49
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,860
valuable.

50
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,600
Now, in terms of our first goal for this lesson, getting a quick look at a database, that's really

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,450
all I need you to absorb right now, that we can use a database to permanently store data and that a

52
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,990
database also makes it very easy to stay organized and work with that data, if that makes even a little

53
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,530
bit of sense than we are ready to move on to goal number two.

54
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,930
And this is where you're going to roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty, and create your very

55
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,960
own new database that you are in control of.

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,460
Let's get started.

57
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:14,810
The first step is to open a new tab in your Web browser and visit Mongo DB dot com.

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,980
Or you can just perform a Google search for Mongo DB.

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,590
And this website should be the first result.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,100
Now the question becomes, what in the world is Mongu GB?

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,910
Well, Mongo DB is just one of many different database systems.

62
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:42,560
You might have heard of other database systems such as MySQL or SQL Server or Oracle or Maria DB or

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
many, many others.

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,070
Now, these different database systems have different philosophies and different features.

65
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,630
But at the end of the day, all databases are used to store data and to make that data easy to work

66
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,800
with and dig through.

67
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,330
Now, the reason that I chose Mongo DB as our database solution for this course, aside from its tremendous

68
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,260
popularity, is because it does not require us to learn a new language aside from JavaScript.

69
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,440
So I am not saying that Mongo DB is the quote, best database system, nor am I saying that it's the

70
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,260
right choice for every type of application.

71
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:28,610
But what I am saying is that given the focus of this course JavaScript, I do think that Mongo DB is

72
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,540
the simplest and most logical choice for our database needs.

73
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,170
OK, so at this point the question becomes how do we get started using Mongo DB?

74
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,100
Well, from the Mongo DB website.

75
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,350
We want to go ahead and sign up for a free account at the time that I'm recording this on the homepage

76
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,380
of Mongo DB.

77
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,740
There's a sign up form right at the top, but if that's no longer there in the future, when you're

78
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:02,060
watching this video, you can also use the try free button up in the header or you can also look through

79
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,560
the navigation under products and look for Mongo DB Atlas, big picture.

80
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,040
We just want to sign up for a free Mongo DB Atlus account.

81
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,880
So go ahead and sign up by entering your email address.

82
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,490
Aside from your email address, you should just need to enter a first name, last name and choose a

83
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,150
password.

84
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,990
And what's nice is that this account is truly free.

85
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,310
You do not even need to enter a credit card or any type of payment info.

86
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,600
So once you fill in your basic data, go ahead and submit the form.

87
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,460
The page might go blank for a couple of seconds and then redirect you a few times, but you should end

88
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,400
up with a page that looks like this.

89
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,660
So it gives you a bit of a welcome message.

90
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,400
And then it says that you can get started by building your first cluster.

91
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,880
And that's exactly what I want you to do.

92
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,250
I want you to click the build my first cluster button.

93
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,320
If you don't see this exact pop up welcome message, that's OK.

94
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,420
Just look for a create cluster button somewhere.

95
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,090
OK, so I will click build my first cluster.

96
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,990
OK, and then we just need to choose a few options, so the first thing is that we need to choose our

97
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,020
cloud provider and region for cloud provider.

98
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,180
I'm going to choose HWC, which is Amazon Web Services.

99
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,630
Basically, this is just choosing which big, huge company is going to store or save our data.

100
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,000
If Amazon can host all of the data to power the world's most popular shopping website, I think they

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,170
can host the data for a simple to do list app without breaking a sweat.

102
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,560
OK, let's scroll down a bit for the region.

103
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm going to choose North America.

104
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,720
Feel free to choose whichever location is closest to where you live in the world, but you will want

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,160
to choose between the options that include the phrase free tier available.

106
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,970
Right, because we don't want to spend any money on this example project.

107
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,800
OK, I've selected my region.

108
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,730
Let's scroll down.

109
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,240
All of these default options should be OK, you can go ahead and leave your cluster names at two cluster

110
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,750
zero.

111
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,930
That's not important.

112
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,320
And finally, let's click this button down towards the bottom right that says create cluster.

113
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,830
We can see different messages appearing up here with the status of our cluster that's being created

114
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,510
and this could take a few minutes.

115
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,360
So be patient down here in this area that I've highlighted, you can see that it reads your cluster

116
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,390
is being created and it could be up to seven or ten minutes before the Mongo DB service is completed,

117
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,500
creating your cluster.

118
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,810
But eventually the process will complete and that message will go away and that part of the screen will

119
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,860
then look like this.

120
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,320
So you might want to pause this video and go get a snack while you wait for your cluster to finish creating.

121
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,390
But once it is created, the question becomes, what in the world is a cluster, right?

122
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,100
What did we just do or what did we just sign up for and create?

123
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
Well, let me answer a question with another question.

124
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:10,060
When we need to store data for an application that we're going to build, where do we want to store

125
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,660
that data?

126
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,900
We know that we'll want to store the data in a database.

127
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,260
But what I'm getting at is where should that database live?

128
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,540
For example, we could save the database on our own physical personal computer, right on your computer,

129
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,380
hard drive.

130
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,710
But then you would be the only person in the world that could access the data.

131
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,880
Now, that is what many developers do while they are creating or testing an app, because in that case,

132
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,300
they're the only person in the world that needs to be able to use the app.

133
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,960
But eventually you're going to want to push your app and its data up onto the Internet.

134
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,010
So it's accessible to friends, family and other people.

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,530
So instead of saving your database locally on your computer's physical hard drive and then having to

136
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,560
worry about moving the database onto the Internet later on, we're just going to skip that complication

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,890
and mess entirely because we are going to create a database that lives in the cloud from the very start.

138
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,960
So for the purposes of this course, we don't really need to worry about what a cluster is.

139
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,870
All you really need to know is that we just created a place on the Internet or up in the cloud where

140
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,550
our database can live.

141
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:28,690
And in our very next lesson, we are going to create a new database in this area so that you can begin

142
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,590
adding a few sample items in the database just for fun and just for practice, similar to my pet adoption

143
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,500
database that we saw at the beginning of this lesson.

144
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,770
Or in other words, in our next lesson, we are going to learn about the most essential acronym when

145
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,220
it comes to working with databases, and that is crud.

146
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,410
So let's keep our momentum rolling.

147
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,610
And most importantly, let's find out what in the world crud means.
