00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.030
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.190
In this lesson, we are going to finish our user profile screen, so from the home page if I visit my

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.940
profile.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.390
So from this screen, I can see any posts created by this user, but I should also be able to click

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.190
on this follower's link to see a list of anyone who follows this user.

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.940
And I should also be able to click on this link to see a list of who this user is following.

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.180
Now, at the moment, clicking on either of these two links does nothing.

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.930
So to get started in this lesson, let's jump into this template and change the ATF values for these

9
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.690
two links within your text editor in your views folder.

10
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.780
I want you to open up profile dot Ejaz on a round line.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.380
Number twenty two, we see several elements.

12
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.910
So these are those three links that say posts, followers and following.

13
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.560
Let's go ahead and update the atrip value for all three of these.

14
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.970
So first, for the posts link that should be slash profile slash username only.

15
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.080
We want the user name to be dynamic.

16
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:27.190
So let's drop in to SJS and say profile user name to save a bit of typing.

17
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.050
Let's just copy and paste this entire value.

18
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.100
So right after the opening address, quote, all the way to right before the closing quote.

19
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.590
Copy that.

20
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.750
Let's pasted in for this link.

21
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.860
Now, remember, the second link is to view the followers of this user.

22
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.250
So at the end of this, let's just add another slash and say followers, let's do the same thing for

23
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.360
the following link.

24
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.800
Paste this in and at the very end, slash following.

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.890
OK, now this file that we're in right now profile SJS.

26
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.120
This powers The Post's view for a profile.

27
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.180
But you can imagine that when someone actually clicks on the followers or following link, those would

28
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.170
be powered by their own separate SJS templates.

29
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.070
However, for all three of these pages, this top portion that I'm selecting here would be identical.

30
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.330
So in order to save a bunch of duplicated code, why don't we create a shared include file that can

31
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.610
store all of this HTML?

32
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.980
Let me show you what I have in mind.

33
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.940
So back in our text editor, if we scroll up to the top of this profile template, let's begin selecting

34
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.900
right after we include the reusable flash file.

35
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.220
So we begin with this heading level two and then just select all the way down to include those three

36
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.940
elements we just set up and then stop selecting right before this div with the class of list group.

37
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.720
OK, so with all of this in our clipboard, let's cut.

38
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.420
For now, you can just place a placeholder X here and let's go create a reusable shared include file.

39
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.110
So to do that within our views folder, within the subfolder named includes, I'll just write, click

40
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.260
and choose new file.

41
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.160
Let's name the file profile shared dot SJS within the new file.

42
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.750
Just paste in your clipboard.

43
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.370
OK, let's go ahead and save that and then jump back into a profile that SJS now instead of this placeholder

44
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.390
X, we can just say opening stack.

45
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.300
Let's use a dash, not an equal sign.

46
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.910
An equal sign would escape the output.

47
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.910
But this is HTML that you and I, the developer, just wrote so we can trust it.

48
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.160
Let's say just dash to output it without escaping.

49
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.840
Close that SJS tag and let's say include give it a file path in the includes folder.

50
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.140
File is named Profile Shared.

51
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.540
Cool, let's go ahead and save this, and if we refresh the profile screen, everything should work

52
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.830
exactly the same way.

53
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.510
Cool at this point.

54
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.160
Let's set up new routes so that we can actually click on these followers or following link without receiving

55
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.880
a cannot get message right.

56
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.570
Express can't read our minds.

57
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.750
It's not sure what to display for a profile username slash followers.

58
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.320
So let's go set up those routes right now within the route of our project folder.

59
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:57.110
Jump into Rouda J.S. Here I see a comment profile related routes in order to save a bit of typing,

60
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.180
we can just duplicate this line, right?

61
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.380
This is for the profile slash username Routt.

62
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.880
So just select that entire line.

63
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.670
Copy it right below it.

64
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.580
Paste it in the new copy at the end of the route, right after username.

65
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.580
Just add slash followers.

66
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.450
OK, we still want to begin this route by calling our if user exists, right.

67
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.540
If the username portion of the URL is made up and doesn't exist, we do want to redirect them to a 404

68
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.920
error.

69
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.740
We also still want to keep our shared profile data function.

70
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.060
However, for the third function, we no longer want to call profile posts screen.

71
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.620
So let's change this to instead profile follower's screen.

72
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.140
OK, let's go ahead and save this.

73
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.900
And now we better go into our user controller and create a function with this matching name.

74
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.190
So in our controllers folder, let's dig into user controller Dot J.S..

75
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.040
We want to create a new function.

76
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:15.650
Let's go ahead and scroll down to the very bottom of this file and we can say exports, dot profile,

77
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:25.430
follower's screen, set this to equal a function and make sure that it has parameters of request and

78
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.240
response.

79
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.800
OK, now within the body of this function, let's create a variable.

80
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:38.000
Let's name followers and we can set this to equal and then just use our follow model.

81
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.630
And we haven't created this method yet inside the follow model.

82
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:49.700
But we can very shortly, let's say, follow dot, get followers by IDE.

83
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.220
As you can tell by its name.

84
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.520
The only thing this function would need to do its job is a user ID that you want to look up the followers

85
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.850
for.

86
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.650
So in the parentheses, just say request dot profile user dot underscore id.

87
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.440
OK, now in a minute from now, when we set this method up, we can have it return a promise.

88
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.460
So right before it we would want to include a awaked.

89
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.050
Since we're using a wait, let's be sure to make this an async function.

90
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.540
So include async right here.

91
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.160
Cool.

92
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:31.100
Now once we have our follower's variable ready and this would be an array of users that are following

93
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.970
the current user, well, then we'd be ready to render our template.

94
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:42.290
So on a new line response dot render the template we'd want to render doesn't exist yet.

95
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:48.860
But when we create it a bit later on in the lesson, you can imagine that it would be named profile

96
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.260
dash follower's.

97
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.890
OK, for the second argument, in terms of the data we'd want to pass into this template, let's just

98
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:06.170
say comma and then curly brackets for an object of data and then in order to save a bit of typing,

99
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.770
we can just use this as a reference, right?

100
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.680
When we are rendering the basic profile screen, we wouldn't need posts in this case, but we can just

101
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.720
begin selecting from profile username all the way down to is visitors profile.

102
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:28.370
So just select those four lines of code, copy them down in our new function within this object, just

103
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.240
paste them in.

104
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:38.330
Also, we don't need posts, but let's be sure to include a properly named follow orders and set that

105
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.220
to follow orders.

106
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.820
Sure.

107
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.370
To include a comma here as well.

108
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.400
Cool.

109
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.950
Now, this is also a great moment for me to say.

110
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.200
Do as I say, not as I do.

111
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.810
What I mean is throughout the course when I've been using the await feature, I have not been perfectly

112
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.170
diligent about wrapping it inside a try block.

113
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.580
Let me show you what I mean.

114
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:05.870
We'd actually want to cut all of this from let followers down to the end of our render line, cut that

115
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:12.410
into your clipboard and we'd want to say try curly brackets and then right after them.

116
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.620
Curly brackets within the tri block, we could just paste back in our code.

117
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.870
And then within the catch block, this would run if there were any errors during any of this code,

118
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:34.120
essentially in situations where you're using a weight instead of DOT, then catch.

119
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:41.610
Well, you do want to be sure to set up try blocks and catch blocks right after the word catch here.

120
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:47.340
You can include parentheses and a parameter to catch whatever value one of your promises would reject

121
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:47.670
with.

122
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.860
But in this case, we don't even need that.

123
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:57.960
We can just do something super generic in the catch block, like maybe rendering our 404 template this

124
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.070
way in case something unexpected happens and there's an error in your code.

125
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.930
Your server doesn't just blow up.

126
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.400
Right.

127
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.510
It handles the situation gracefully.

128
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.420
Cool at this point.

129
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.710
Let's go ahead and save this file.

130
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.550
And now we better go into our follow model and set up a method named Git Follower's by IDE.
