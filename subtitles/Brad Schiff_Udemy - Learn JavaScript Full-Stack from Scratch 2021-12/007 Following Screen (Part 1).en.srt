00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:10,710
In this lesson, we are going to finish our user profile screen, so in our previous lesson, we set

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,580
things up so that from a user's profile, you can click on followers to see a list of who is following

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,150
this user.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,650
However, if I click on this following link, we see an error message.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,400
So right now, let's just jump into our router and set up a route that would match this Eurail pattern.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,080
Let me show you what I mean.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:41,790
So in our text, Ed, I want you to open up router J.S. here we see a comment profile related routes,

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,350
and we can actually just duplicate this line, the line with the route of profile and then username

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,000
and then slash followers.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,250
Let's just copy and paste or duplicate that entire line.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,240
And then on the new duplicated copy, just change the closing forward slash followers into forward slash

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,620
following.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,120
OK, now for this following route, we still want to begin by checking to see if this user exists and

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,540
we'd still want to call our shared profile data function.

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,800
But the final and third function should no longer be profile follower's screen.

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,090
Let's instead change this to profile following screen, right.

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,280
If someone comes to this route, they want to know who that user is following.

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,030
Now let's go ahead and save this file.

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,860
And now we better jump in to our user controller and create a function with this matching name.

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,720
So within our controllers folder, jump in to user controller Dot J.S..

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,540
If we scroll down to the very bottom, we should see a line that begins with exports dot profile, follower's

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,020
screen.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,320
We can actually just duplicate this function and then adjust the new copy.

25
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,080
So select this entire function, copy that into your clipboard and then right at the very bottom of

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,370
this file, just paste it in on this new duplicate copy.

27
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,040
Let's change the name to profile following scre.

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,040
OK then on this line when we create a variable and say let follower's equal, let's change this from

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,650
followers to following.

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,470
And then in terms of what that should equal, we still want to use our follow model.

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,090
But instead of calling a function named git followers by ID, let's change followers so that the function

32
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,810
is named git following by ID.

33
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,320
OK, and then when it comes time to actually render a template, you can imagine that we have a new

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,340
template file named Profile Following instead of followers.

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,570
Let's adjust the name of the template to profile Dasch following and then the data that we're passing

36
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,410
into the template.

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,270
All of these properties can stay the same, but let's change followers into following, right?

38
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,930
This should be a list of the users that this user is following.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,070
Cool.

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,970
At this point.

41
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,070
Let's go ahead and save this file.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,700
And now we better go into our follow model and make sure that it has a function with this matching name.

43
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,700
Right git following by ID.

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,490
So in our models folder, let's jump into follow dot J.S..

45
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,640
OK, down towards the bottom of this file, we're looking for a line that begins with follow dot get

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,500
follower's by IDE.

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,400
Let's go ahead and duplicate this entire function.

48
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,080
So begin selecting.

49
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,430
Go ahead and copy that into your clipboard and then right below it, just paste it in in this new copy,

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:09,260
let's change it to follow DOT get following by I.D., OK?

51
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
It should still return a promise.

52
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,600
The first thing we need to actually change is the match aggregate operator.

53
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:24,230
So instead of looking for documents where the followed ID matches the current ID, we'd instead want

54
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,280
to perform the match.

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,470
Where the Let's change this to author ID field matches this ID just a quick typo.

56
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,220
The D should be lowercase here, so it should be lowercase author and then uppercase AI and then lowercase

57
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,540
D..

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,370
So author id just like this.

59
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,360
OK, so that will find documents in the follow collection where the author ID matches the current profile

60
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,900
user.

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,260
But remember, a follow document only contains the I.D. of the two user.

62
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,000
It doesn't contain their user name and gravitons, which is what we would actually need to display on

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,130
the front end of the site.

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,320
So that's why we have this Look-Up aggregate operation.

65
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:17,750
Only this time, instead of the local field being authorized, let's change the local field to be followed

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,080
I.D. So we're finding follow documents where the current user is the creator of that follow.

67
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:30,830
And then we want to look up information about the document in the user's collection that they are following.

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Right.

69
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,530
Because we want to show a list of the users this person is following.

70
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,140
Now, technically, we could go ahead and update this to say let following instead of let followers.

71
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,620
But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter.

72
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:51,320
That would just be for your own organization and attention to detail, because ultimately this promise

73
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:58,280
is going to resolve with a value and our controller isn't going to know or care what we named that data.

74
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,690
Within this function.

75
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,370
All the controller cares about is that it's receiving an array.

76
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,130
So just for our own human purposes, you could go through in anywhere you see follower's change it to

77
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,780
following throughout this code.

78
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,400
But from a computer's perspective, it won't make any difference.

79
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,860
So we're actually safe to go ahead and save this.

80
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,800
And now let's jump back into our user controller to refresh our memory of what we're doing here.

81
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,940
So we now have this variable named following.

82
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,120
And ultimately we just want to show that within an HTML template that we're rendering.

83
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,780
So let's go ahead and create a new Ajay's file named Profile Following, and then we can just loop through

84
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,750
the array named following.

85
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:51,110
So within the root of your project folder, look in the views folder and let's just go ahead and copy

86
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,820
and paste from our profile dash followers dot SJS file.

87
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:02,390
So jump into profile followers, select everything into your clipboard and copy and then we can just

88
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,150
create a brand new file in our views folder.

89
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Let's name it profile dash following SJS in that new file, just paste in your clipboard and then around

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,230
line number nine, instead of calling for each on followers.

91
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,780
Let's change this to following.

92
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,530
And now this code would work at this point, but for our own organization purposes, you could update

93
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,790
the word follower here to be followed user instead.

94
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:43,940
If I select follower here once and then press controlled the on windows or command the on Mac, you

95
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,140
can see that each time I press it, it selects the next instance of that word.

96
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:58,010
So this way I have four instances of it selected at once and I can just begin typing followed user and

97
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,970
you can see it was updated in all four blinking cursor locations.

98
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,050
Cool.

99
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,390
Let's go ahead and save this file.

100
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:13,850
And now back in the browser, if I click on the following link for barks a lot, it makes sense for

101
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,630
this area to be empty because this user is not following anyone.

102
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:25,190
However, if I go to my own profile, I know that my account is following the Bark's line account.

103
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:32,240
So now if I click on following Perfect, you can see that my broad account is following Bachs a lot

104
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,860
at this point.

105
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,750
Let's change gears now.

106
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,880
Let's work on visually selecting or highlighting the actual current page.

107
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,750
What I mean by this is we are currently on the following screen or following you around, but visually

108
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,960
it still looks like the posts link is selected.

109
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,600
Let me show you how I would set things up.

110
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,670
So that the current page will actually appear highlighted back in our text.

111
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:08,680
Ed, I want you to jump in to user controller Dot J.S. within our exports profile following screen area.

112
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,190
When we render our template, let's just give it one additional property that tells it the current page.

113
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,590
So, for example, I'd create a new property.

114
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,230
You could name it whatever you want.

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm going to name it current page and just give it a value of a string of text that says following.

116
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:35,260
Be sure to add a comma at the end of that line and then let's just do this same thing for the followers

117
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,130
and posts screens as well.

118
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,410
So if we just scroll up a little bit within our user controller file, here's the function for the followers

119
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:44,970
screen.

120
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:53,110
So I would just give it a current page property and set it to follower's comma.

121
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,650
And then if we scroll up a little bit further, we should see exports dot profile posts screen.

122
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,480
So again, give it a property.

123
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,950
Let's say current page should be posts include the comma.

124
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,510
Let's go ahead and save this file.

125
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:18,190
And now we just need to dig into the file that outputs this navigation HTML to refresh your memory,

126
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:25,060
to find that we would look inside our views folder and then within the includes subfolder.

127
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:35,110
We're looking for the file that is named Profile Shared SJS towards the bottom around line number 15.

128
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:41,050
We see several links, right posts, followers and following.

129
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,120
Now you'll notice that the first link has a class of active.

130
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,330
This is why the posts link always appears to be selected.

131
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,790
So what we need to do is write a bit of dynamic code to add this class of active to the actually current

132
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,450
page.

133
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,140
Let me show you how I would set this up.

134
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,710
So let's get rid of the word active here and in its place.

135
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:12,850
Let's drop in to SJS instead of an IF statement, we could use a ternary operator.

136
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:20,860
So we first include our condition, let's say current page, if that equals again, double equals sign

137
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,270
to check for equality.

138
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,480
If that equals single quotes, let's say if that equals posts, then we include a question mark and

139
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,330
let's have a placeholder X to say what we would want to do.

140
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:41,440
If this is true, then we include a colon and then I'll have another placeholder X, and this is where

141
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,710
we say what we'd want to do if this evaluates to false.

142
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,220
So for the first placeholder X, if this is true, that's where we could just get rid of the placeholder

143
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:58,660
X have single quotes and just output the phrase active for the second placeholder X..

144
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,990
Let's get rid of that and we can just have an empty pair of quotes.

145
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,850
We don't want to output anything.

146
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,480
OK, now we can just copy and duplicate this ternary operator for the followers and following links

147
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,950
as well.

148
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,110
So begin selecting from the opening tag to the closing of the tag.

149
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,370
Let's copy that.

150
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:24,700
And then on the followers line right before the closing quote for the class value, just paste in your

151
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,390
clipboard.

152
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:34,510
Only this time the condition we check for is if current page equals instead of posts, it would be followers.

153
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,180
Let's do the same thing for the following link.

154
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:44,880
So we'd paste in our clipboard here and then check if current page equals following.

155
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,920
Let's go ahead and give this a save and then test it out.

156
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,410
So back in the browser, I'm currently on the following U.

157
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:01,270
RL and if I refresh perfect, we see that that link is now actually visibly selected.

158
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,550
And if I go to the follower screen, cool, it's selected as well.

159
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,200
Perfect.

160
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,260
Now for our one final task in this lesson.

161
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,520
Let's set things up so that these values or these numbers in these links actually make sense and are

162
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,710
actually pulling in real data.
