1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,140
If I refresh the home page, it's still pulling in my real avatar, and now if I visit the create post

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,170
screen, awesome, it's using that uniform new header file.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,750
Now, another area in our code where we can remove duplication is when we pass session data into the

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,830
current template that we want to render.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,290
What I mean is I think it's safe to assume that for nearly every single template in our app, we are

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:35,790
going to want that template to have access to the current user session data like username and Avatar,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,320
so on and so forth.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,270
Let me show you what I'm getting at.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:47,250
So back in our text, Ed, I want you to jump in to user controller J.S. within user controller, scroll

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,180
down to the bottom.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,570
And we are interested in the home function.

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,080
If a user is logged in, they're going to see the home dashboard and we're going to need to pass that

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,650
template.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,950
A bit of session data, right.

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,660
The user name and the avatar.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:10,660
And we have this exact code that we want to pass into the template in our post controller as well.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,220
So instead of duplicating this highlighted code, whenever we want to render a template with our unique

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,070
header, well, let's save a ton of duplication by creating a middleware function.

19
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,340
Let me show you how we can set this up.

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:34,470
So right now, I want you to jump in to our main app, JS file within our app file, maybe in between

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,740
when we call flash and pull in our router.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:46,080
In between those two lines, let's add a new line and let's say app use within these parentheses.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,370
Let's provide a function.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,280
Within our functions, parentheses, let's include three parameters request response and next.

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,440
OK, and now within the function, I want to let you know that if we say response locals, well, we

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,460
are now working with an object that will be available from within our Ajay's templates so we can add

27
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,570
any objects or properties we want onto this locals object.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:25,290
So let's just say dot user and then let's set that to equal request dot session dot user.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,470
OK, then below this line, let's just be sure to call next.

30
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:38,350
So all together, when we say app dot use, we are telling Express to run this function for every request.

31
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,580
And because we are including this before our router, this means this will run first.

32
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,850
And then since we are calling next, Express will move on to run the actual relevant functions for a

33
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,990
particular route.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,400
OK, but big picture, this means that we now have access to a user property from within any of our

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,930
SJS templates.

36
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,710
So let's go ahead and save this file and then let's jump into our two controller files and remove that

37
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,330
duplicated code where we passan session data to a template.

38
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,930
So first in user controller Gorgias down at the bottom within our home function for this response,

39
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,460
not render home dashboard.

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,950
We can just get rid of this second argument.

41
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,080
Cool.

42
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,830
Let's save that and then we can do the same thing within our post controller in post controller.

43
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,810
When we are rendering the create post template, we can now get rid of this second argument.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,050
Let's go ahead and save that.

45
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:49,390
And now we just need to update our heterozygous and home dashboard SJS templates to pull from that new

46
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,560
user object.

47
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:58,300
Let's first jump into home dash dashboard and on line number five, when we say hello and then their

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,250
username, your feed is empty.

49
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,550
Well, instead of just looking for a properly named username, we would now want to look inside a user

50
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,440
object for that property.

51
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,540
OK, let's go ahead and save that.

52
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:18,040
And then finally, let's jump into our header SJS file and on line number twenty, when we are pulling

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,180
in the gravity image, let's just scroll over to its source.

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,200
And instead of looking for an Avatar property, we'd want to look within our user object for Avatar.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,310
Let's go ahead and save this and test it out.

56
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,650
So back in the browser by refresh the create post screen, everything's still working.

57
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,550
And if I click this to go back to the home page, awesome.

58
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,510
We're still in business.

59
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,850
There's my username and there's my granddaughter.

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,510
Except now we don't have to manually pass in that session.

61
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,520
Data for every template render.

62
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,750
And while we're at it, let's go ahead and get rid of even more duplication.

63
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:04,030
Let's set things up so that our guest homepage template also pulls in our one shared header include

64
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,480
file.

65
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Let me show you how we can set this up back in our text editor within our Views folder.

66
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,280
Let's jump into home dash guest SJS.

67
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:24,130
And before we delete all of this header code, let's first copy the login form into our clipboard.

68
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,050
So around line number seventeen, we see an opening form tag.

69
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,050
Go ahead and begin selecting there and then select down until the closing form tag.

70
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,320
Be sure to copy that into your clipboard.

71
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,670
What we're going to do is move that into our shared header, include file and then just check to see

72
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,370
if there is a user object on the section.

73
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,200
If there's not, then we can show them this form instead of the top right menu.

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,160
OK, with that in your clipboard, go ahead and select from this area that says header ends here and

75
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,220
just delete from there all the way up to the top of this file, OK?

76
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,980
And in its place, let's just say less than percentage dash.

77
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,030
Let's close that out.

78
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,770
Percentage greater than in between.

79
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,410
Let's just say include give it a path.

80
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,080
Look in the includes folder for header.

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,040
All right.

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,540
Let's go ahead and save that.

83
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,660
And now let's jump into that shared header file.

84
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,040
So within our views folder, inside includes there's header.

85
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,330
And I want you to focus on line number sixteen.

86
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,550
That's where we should see an opening H four or heading level for tag.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,360
That H for Element represents our logo or home link in the top left.

88
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,040
Now the code right after that.

89
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,340
So right below sixteen should be different depen.

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,060
On whether you're logged in or not, if you're logged in, we want to show you this menu of options.

91
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,990
If you're not logged in, then right below this age, for we would want to have that log in form.

92
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:09,660
So do this with me right below line 16, add a new line and let's just set up if Elst blocks so in Ejaz

93
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,680
to do something dynamic, less than percentage to close that percentage greater than, let's say, if

94
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:24,510
parentheses curly brackets drop down right below the closing curly brackets for the if, let's say else,

95
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,590
curly brackets.

96
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,290
OK, now for our condition.

97
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,880
In these parentheses, all we have to do is just say user.

98
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,650
Right, because we created that function that's going to run for all requests.

99
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,760
And we said response dot locals, dot user.

100
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,320
Well, if it's able to find any relevant session data, then this would evaluate to true.

101
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,640
But if it's empty or doesn't exist, this will evaluate to false.

102
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,130
Let's start with the else block first.

103
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,300
So this would mean that the user is not logged in.

104
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,730
So within the else block, just paste in your clipboard.

105
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,160
Cool, so non logged in users see the login form for users that are logged in, all we need to do is

106
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,010
scroll down and just move this div with their profile photo and the log out form.

107
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,560
Just move this up into that if block.

108
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:24,660
So begin selecting this div and then select down to the closing log out form tag and then also select

109
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,070
one more closing div, but not two more closing div tags.

110
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,080
So let's cut that into our clipboard and then back within this if block just paste it in.

111
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:43,490
Now before we save this, we do need to pay attention to when we are dropping in and out of our dynamic

112
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,490
SJS mode on this first line with the IF statement after the opening curly bracket, we do want to drop

113
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:58,470
out of dynamic mode so percentage greater than and then on this line with the else at the beginning,

114
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,110
we'd want to drop back into dynamic mode.

115
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,830
So less than percentage at the end of this line drop back out, so percentage greater then.

116
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,480
And then finally on the line where we close the else block should be sure to jump into dynamic mode.

117
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,780
And then at the end we've already jumped out.

118
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,090
So let's go ahead and save this and test it out back in the browser.

119
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,180
If I refresh the homepage while I'm logged in, cool.

120
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,200
We still see the header.

121
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,130
That makes sense.

122
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,850
And if I visit the home page in a browser that's not logged in, if I refresh, we still see the log

123
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,390
in form.

124
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,430
Perfect.

125
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Now let's complete one final super quick task before bringing this lesson to a close.

126
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:48,360
Since we've set up a reusable file for our header, let's go ahead and set up a reusable file for our

127
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,020
footer.

128
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,010
That way, our templates will not have any duplicated code.

129
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:00,360
So to set this up back in our text editor, let's start with our home dash guest SJS template.

130
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,720
Technically, you could start with any of our three main templates, Home Ghast, Home Dashboard or

131
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,650
create post.

132
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,800
But if you scroll down to the very bottom, you'll see this comment that says footer begins.

133
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,620
So just begin selecting right after that comment.

134
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,700
So include the opening footer tag down to the bottom of the file.

135
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,430
Let's copy that into our clipboard.

136
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,300
And now let's go create a separate include file for that.

137
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:36,900
So within our views folder inside includes let's create a new file, let's name it Footer Dot, SJS

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,260
in this new file, just paste in your clipboard and save now back in home, dash guest.

139
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,350
Just delete that code and also delete this comment.

140
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:54,120
Footer begins and let's just pull in that include so less than percentage dash close that tag out and

141
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,720
then just say include give it a path.

142
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,010
Look in the includes folder for footer to save typing.

143
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,520
Let's copy this include command into our clipboard.

144
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:15,230
And now let's just go update Home Dashboard and create post, so in-home dashboard SJS, scroll down

145
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,440
to the bottom where we see this comment footer begin.

146
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,390
Select that down to the very bottom.

147
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,820
Delete paste in your clipboard.

148
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,930
Save that.

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,660
Let's do the same thing for create dash post SJS down at the bottom.

150
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,810
Select from here down, replace it with your clipboard, let's save that looks like I forgot to save

151
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,950
home, Dash guessed, save that.

152
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:47,190
And now, no matter which template we go to homepage, create post or the guest homepage or footer is

153
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
still working and now our templates don't have any duplicated code.

154
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,350
I know this was a long, tedious lesson, but now that we've gotten rid of all that duplicated code

155
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:05,730
in our next lesson, we can actually work on the task of saving a post into the database.

156
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,300
Right.

157
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,940
We can get back to the actual task at hand of letting users create posts.

158
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,090
That should be a lot of fun to set up.

159
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,710
Let's keep things rolling and I'll see you then.
