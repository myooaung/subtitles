Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.880
In this lesson, we are going to learn how to make our title tag have a dynamic value.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:17.080
So as of right now, no matter which page we go to within our application, the title you can see the

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.460
area that I'm selecting in the top left corner, this remains the same.

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.940
Now, ideally, for search engine optimization reasons, we would want this to update depending on the

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.560
page.

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.490
So, for example, if I click on to the Catnip is Delicious post, we'd probably want this title of

8
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.560
Catnip is delicious to appear somewhere in the title.

9
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.650
So our first step towards making the title dynamic would be to find this title tag within our HTML template.

10
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.100
So let me show you where we can find that within your text editor.

11
00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.460
Jump into the views folder and then look within the includes subfolder.

12
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.540
We want to open up header SJS around line number seven.

13
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.820
We should see the title tag.

14
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.840
So at the moment it has a hardcoded value of our app.

15
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.190
Now, since this one file powers the header for every single page in our application, you might be

16
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.840
wondering how we can have this use a dynamic value.

17
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.340
Well, let me show you what I would do.

18
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.080
So let's take an individual post screen as our first example.

19
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.510
So imagine when you're viewing a post.

20
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.980
The title should be the post title and then maybe a dash or a pipe and then our app.

21
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.080
Let me show you how I would set that up.

22
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:52.960
So within your controllers folder, I want you to jump into post controller J.S. I want you to find

23
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.720
the function that is named View Single.

24
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.840
So that line of code begins with exports.

25
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.100
Dot view single.

26
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.010
Well, when we are rendering the template.

27
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.360
So response don't render a single post screen in addition to just giving it a property of post, let's

28
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.250
just give it another property of title.

29
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.530
So right after post column post I would add a comma and then say title colon and then I would just give

30
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.900
it a value of post title.

31
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.250
OK, let's go ahead and save this and then let's jump back into our header file.

32
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.450
So around line number seven, let's get rid of the hardcoded our app value and within the two title

33
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.710
tags, let's drop into SJS to do something dynamic.

34
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.580
So I have an equal sign here because I want to output something.

35
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.920
And then I would just do this, let's say type of parentheses.

36
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.440
Let's give that a value of title.

37
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
And I'm just checking to see if the title property has been set or not.

38
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.090
Right, because we wouldn't want this to blow up or throw an error message on a screen or controller

39
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.210
route where we have not defined a title property.

40
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.230
So let's do this.

41
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's use a ternary operator.

42
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.990
So our condition will be if type of title.

43
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.760
Double equals, sign the check for equality and let's say quotes undefined.

44
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.290
So if this evaluates to true right.

45
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.860
If this is a controller or route that does not have a title property, then we can say questionmark

46
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.620
within a ternary operator to say what we want to do.

47
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.760
If this is true for now, let's just have a placeholder X, then we can have a Colen and another placeholder

48
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040
X, this secondary placeholder will run if this evaluates to false.

49
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.740
So if there is no title property, right, if title is undefined, then instead of this first placeholder

50
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.840
X, I would just have quotes and say our app as a fallback.

51
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.150
But if there is a title property being passed into this template instead of the X placeholder, I would

52
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.920
just have backed X so I can do something dynamic in between the two back dicks.

53
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.300
I would say dollar sign curly brackets and say title and then maybe right after those curly brackets

54
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.100
you could have a dash or a pipe.

55
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.820
It doesn't matter.

56
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.790
It's up to you, just some sort of visual separation.

57
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.490
And then I would also have the name of our application.

58
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.210
OK, so altogether this is what that line of code looks like.

59
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.560
It's just the title tag.

60
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.510
And then if you want to pause the video to type this out, that's OK.

61
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.980
At this point, though, I'm going to save.

62
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.240
And now back on the front end of the website if I refresh.

63
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.500
Cool, you can see for this individual post screen or you URL, the title bar is now Catnip is delicious

64
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.080
and then a vertical pipe and then our app.

65
00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.170
But if I go to any other screen, so if I go back to the homepage or if I go to my profile, notice,

66
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.610
the title is simply our app.

67
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.820
So at this point it's up to you.

68
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.270
You're free to go into any controller and provide a title property when you are rendering a template.

69
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.560
Practice makes perfect, so I'll walk through this with you for one more example, let's assume that

70
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.820
on the main profile screen we would want the title to say profile for and then the username.

71
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.690
Right.

72
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.850
And then our heterozygous would add the vertical pipe and then our app.

73
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.170
So let me show you how I would set that up within our controllers folder.

74
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.290
Let's go into our user controller.

75
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.490
Let's find the function that is named profile posts screen.

76
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.940
For me, it's around line number 96, right, exports, profile posts, screen, and when we render

77
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.560
this template, I would just give it an additional property named title.

78
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.070
So title Colan, be sure to include a comma and then before the comma for the value, I would just have

79
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.940
to back ticks and in between the back takes, I would say profile for and then I would want to do something

80
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.830
dynamic's a dollar sign curly brackets and then to pull in the profile username.

81
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.910
I would just say this.

82
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.660
So request profile user dot username.

83
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.910
Cool, so this will get passed into the template, which will ultimately run our heterozygous file and

84
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.880
it will know what to do.

85
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.850
So let's go ahead and save this.

86
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.430
And then if I refresh the profile for Brad.

87
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.630
You can see up in the title bar profile for Brad Vertical Pipe.

88
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.060
Our app, you get the idea you're free to go through and add custom titles for any template that you're

89
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.600
rendering.

90
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.080
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson.

91
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.230
If I sign out really quick, we are going to add live validation to our registration form.

92
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.520
So, for example, when a new user tries to sign up on the fly, we will let them know if that user

93
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.410
name has already been taken or not.

94
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.620
The same thing with the email.

95
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.700
We will let them know if that's already been used and we will check our other validation rules as well.

96
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.220
So if they type in a user name that has too many characters or not enough characters, we will let them

97
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.370
know what the little red error message in real time.

98
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.040
This way we check for errors before they even ever submit the form to the server.

99
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.490
This should greatly enhance our user experience.

100
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.020
So let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
