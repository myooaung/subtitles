1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Okay,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,370
guys,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,590
um,

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,820
welcome back in this exercise,

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,320
we're going to memorize the 10 Commandments,

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,690
and you're gonna need a route with 10 waypoints.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,420
Given that we will be memorized in the 10 Commandments,

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,050
she may want to consider setting this scene at some suitable location,

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,450
maybe a church.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,400
You can either have your individual locations inside or outside,

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,360
or moving from one to the other,

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,850
as long as you are familiar with the route.

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,440
Now,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,100
be sure that each of the 10 points are distinct and separate from each other on.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,980
Remember your knees.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,120
Call in everything at your imaginative disposal to make each scene unforgettable.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,920
Now,

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,560
remember,

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,600
you don't have to get it word for word.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,720
Just something that you can latch onto to get back to what it is.

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,960
The rest we can fill in as we go.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,750
Now,

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,490
if you need to pause the lecture now,

24
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,630
plan your route.

25
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,620
And when you're ready,

26
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,080
hit,

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,700
Play on.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,650
Let's do this.

29
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,440
I'll give you about 10 seconds between each.

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,890
But if you need a little longer,

31
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,070
just hit.

32
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,770
Pause.

33
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,590
Ready?

34
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,510
Okay.

35
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,750
Number one,

36
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,470
though shalt have no other gods before me,

37
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:28,250
though.

38
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,150
Shalt not worship false idols,

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:47,590
though shall not take the name of the Lord in vain.

40
00:01:47,590 --> 00:02:01,850
Remember the Sabbath?

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:16,680
Only your father and mother.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:31,150
Those shall not kill,

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:44,830
though shall not commit.

44
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,750
Adultery,

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:58,150
though.

46
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,450
Shall not steal,

47
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:15,290
though shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

48
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:29,850
Those shell nook of it.

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:38,380
Okay,

50
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,040
got them.

51
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,690
Okay,

52
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,180
let's do a quick review.

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,050
What was the first,

54
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,090
though,

55
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,340
shall have no the gods before me.

56
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,640
I think of my first location is just having one person in it with a big red rope.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,150
Power in entrance as no one else is allowed in.

58
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,030
Okay.

59
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,050
And number two,

60
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,540
though,

61
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,640
shall not worship false idols here.

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
I just think of Billy Idol.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,650
Maybe you thought of someone you know who is idle,

64
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,780
which is phonetically the same thing.

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,330
Okay.

66
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,910
Said,

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,500
though shall not take the name of the Lord in vain.

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,040
I think of Carly Simon singing your so vain.

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,540
Perhaps you used a weathervane.

70
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,250
Whatever you did is perfectly fine.

71
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,110
Number four.

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,820
Remember the Sabbath here?

73
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,430
I think of Ozzy Osborne,

74
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,240
lead singer of Black Sabbath,

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,790
who was born just up the road from me in Birmingham.

76
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,870
Okay,

77
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,680
we're halfway point now.

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Number five on your father and mother.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,900
I just have my mom and dad here,

80
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,850
nice and simple.

81
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,520
Number six,

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,850
though,

83
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,640
shall not kill here.

84
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,160
I use Max from the eighties TV detective show heart to heart wherever there was a case to

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,700
be solved.

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,350
Maksoud against this being avoid up number seven,

87
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,500
though shall not commit adultery.

88
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,570
You don't need to know how I remember that one.

89
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,300
Number eight,

90
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,450
though,

91
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,800
shall not steal.

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,510
Here.

93
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,100
I have a cartoon thief complete with a striped jumper in a swank bank.

94
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,690
And we're almost there.

95
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,500
Number nine.

96
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,950
Now those shelnut bear false witness against your neighbor.

97
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,440
Or like in any other words for me.

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,040
I use the whole cast of the TV show Silent Witness which gets me back to the witness and

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,650
bearing false witness on the last one.

100
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:48,140
Those shelnut covet yearn to possess something belonging to another.

101
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,530
My buddy has a really nice motorbike,

102
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,570
which I like a lot,

103
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,060
but it spends more time in the carriage than on the road.

104
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,410
Okay,

105
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,960
so how did you do?

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,440
If there were any in there that you struggled with?

107
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,590
Go back and take a look at the association you formed.

108
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,740
Could you add anything to it using your wild imagination that would make it more memorable

109
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:09,740
.

110
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,750
Sometimes just coming back to it a little later can be enough to give you a new flash of

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,710
inspiration.

112
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,560
Okay,

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,850
time for another test,

114
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,050
and I'll see you after that.
