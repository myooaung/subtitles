1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Okay,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,790
guys.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,330
And welcome back.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,220
I never forget a face,

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,080
but in your case,

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,280
I'll make an exception.

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,150
I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,890
Well,

9
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,240
we've all bean there.

10
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,210
You're out shopping or in a restaurant,

11
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,450
and all of a sudden someone walks up to you and say hi.

12
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,020
Fancy seeing you here.

13
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,310
You see the face.

14
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,820
You know that you've met before.

15
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,200
But for the life of you,

16
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,270
you can't recall where or when and their name.

17
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,150
Forget it.

18
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,130
So you respond in the way with socially conditioned to do.

19
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,020
I'm great.

20
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,850
How are you?

21
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,180
Unless the conversation continues,

22
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,340
you rack your brain.

23
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,400
When do I know this person from?

24
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,640
If you could just get to that,

25
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,860
you may be able to get to their name.

26
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,120
You hope that something they say in the conversation will trigger the memory.

27
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,140
And it will all come flooding back.

28
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,950
But no.

29
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,310
And now you're in a bind.

30
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,420
You're a few minutes into the conversation,

31
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,890
and now it's too late to say sorry.

32
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,810
I know we've met,

33
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,150
but who are you again?

34
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,130
If you would just come clean at the start and said remind me of your name.

35
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,650
Everything would have been so much easier.

36
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,030
But Wouldn't it be even better if you have a system for never forgetting a face?

37
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,380
Or,

38
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,670
more importantly,

39
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,210
a name again?

40
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,070
But if you think about it,

41
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,130
we actually have a pretty good natural ability to remember.

42
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,390
Faces were designed that way.

43
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,470
When most people struggle is putting a name to a face on People can be terribly offended if

44
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,300
you can't recall their name when you meet someone for the first time.

45
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,610
The general advice is to immediately use their name back to them in conversation,

46
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,470
in the hope that repetition will make it stick.

47
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:39,980
Now,

48
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,280
sometimes this is useful in the short term,

49
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,370
but next week or next month,

50
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,040
next year not so much.

51
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,880
I want set a meeting with the supplier on the guy.

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,900
I won't name him.

53
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,880
Actually suffix almost every sentence with my name.

54
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,770
Great to meet you,

55
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,140
Alan.

56
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,540
Yes,

57
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,520
I'd love a coffee.

58
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,850
Alan,

59
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,950
Thank you for seeing me,

60
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,350
Alan.

61
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,220
There is a point where it becomes weird on we just don't do that with people we generally

62
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,070
know do way.

63
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,620
So why do we do it with people we've just met?

64
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,820
It's unnatural.

65
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,800
So how do we do it?

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,690
Well,

67
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,100
looking for us we do have any NACE ability to recognize faces,

68
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,380
so we're already halfway there.

69
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,950
All we need to do now is apply a little association,

70
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:28,090
a location on a dose of imagination and permanently link the name to the face on while

71
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,750
we're at it.

72
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,380
For the ultimate flattery.

73
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,110
A few of the details about them,

74
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,550
too.

75
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,930
No names tend to come in pairs,

76
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,270
with the exception of people like Beyonce and Madonna,

77
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,400
Sting and Prince.

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,650
So we have two things to recall.

79
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,050
A thirst name on the last name,

80
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,690
so let's take them in order.

81
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,580
By far the simplest way to recall someone's name is to associate it with something We

82
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,400
already know the K off knees knowledge.

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
If I want to give you a bunch of names,

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,580
you may find that you already know someone with the same name.

85
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,250
Let's try it.

86
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,150
Emma David,

87
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,150
Sally Luca,

88
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,750
Tracy Joe.

89
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,840
Now,

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,310
obviously,

91
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,390
depending on where in the world you are,

92
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,020
you may personally know Farm or Lucas than you do Emma's.

93
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,050
You get the picture.

94
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,670
What about these names Elvis share Clint,

95
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,920
Alanis,

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,880
Keifer,

97
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,560
Charlie's all these and much more unusual,

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,710
but I would be willing to bet that you could probably picture someone with those names some

99
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,210
at least,

100
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,350
if not all.

101
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,270
Now.

102
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,230
I happened upon this method quite by accident when I was in my teens that then I had

103
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,090
trouble with Poles and Johns.

104
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,180
I don't know why,

105
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,050
but whenever I met someone named Paul or John,

106
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,710
it was 50 50 on whether I would call them by their right name,

107
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,370
even after I had known them for months.

108
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,500
The only exception was my cousin Paul.

109
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,320
So that's where I started.

110
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,720
Whenever I met someone named Paul,

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,490
I would instantly transport him in my mind to my cousin Paul's house and have him right

112
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,640
there in the room talking to him.

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,470
This works so well.

114
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,700
I embarked on a campaign of all the John's and Paul's I already knew and surreptitiously

115
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,470
solicited their names from other people.

116
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,380
If needs me and deposited all my polls at my cousins,

117
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,020
have I even dropped all my Paul is in there for good measure.

118
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,050
That's a pretty crowded place now,

119
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,470
now this off my Paul problem,

120
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,280
but not my jump problem.

121
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,690
I didn't know anyone named John well enough to be all the other Jong's Star Trek style to

122
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,400
be with them,

123
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,490
then he don't on me that the only John I was really quite familiar with was the American

124
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,590
term for toilet or bathroom for those in the US So all my johns were immediately and

125
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,350
irrevocably tele ported to the toilet.

126
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,330
Not terribly ceremonious,

127
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,250
but effective.

128
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,170
Now,

129
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,160
like most people,

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,780
I have quite a few people.

131
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,850
I know friends,

132
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,760
family work,

133
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,110
but is and this gave me a veritable treasure trove of hooks I could use whenever I met

134
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,950
someone new.

135
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,150
I just zoom them to the A place that I associate ID with my name alike.

136
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,480
But what if I didn't already personally know someone with that name?

137
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,220
Well,

138
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,850
I just go to the movies or the charts.

139
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,450
I looked for an immediate namesake in someone famous and tie them together that way.

140
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,150
Then we get to the more unusual derivative names.

141
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,840
Paulette,

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,680
for example,

143
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
also lives at my cousin's halves,

144
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,920
but instead of interactive with all my other polls and Paul Er's she's separate from them

145
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,390
loading a washing machine.

146
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,620
Now this reminds me of Lawn Direct,

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,080
and I can successfully reconstruct her name.

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,650
From there,

149
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:53,580
I get the stem Paul issues in my Paul Place but doing the washing gives me the at ending.

150
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,170
In fact,

151
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,450
all my ex do the washing wherever they happen to bay.

152
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,440
Similarly,

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,050
all my ekes drink champagne.

154
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,170
Dominique's Vera leaks Anja leaks all set the finest champagne very elegantly from

155
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,970
beautiful crystal flutes.

156
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,350
Ik just sounds posh to me.

157
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,560
All my l's are ringing bells and I bet you can guess why,

158
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,750
Isabel Mirror,

159
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,660
Bell Brielle.

160
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,150
All my Ellis have umbrellas.

161
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,820
Stella.

162
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,600
Gabriella!

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,450
Antonella.

164
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,820
If I come across the name I've never heard before I look for sound alikes or break it down

165
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,590
fanatically.

166
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,190
Brielle at,

167
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,970
for example,

168
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,300
gives me cheese.

169
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,210
Brie on umbrella.

170
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,900
Enzo makes me think of Ferrari.

171
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,450
Leif gets me to Leaf.

172
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,580
See one associations you can create out of the following names.

173
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,050
Ladies first.

174
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,150
Jessica,

175
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,050
Sarah,

176
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,030
Emily,

177
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,650
Rebecca,

178
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:57,350
Emma on the boys Joshua Daniel,

179
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,150
Matthew,

180
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:08,460
James Thomas Do you already know someone with any of those names or buy a plane?

181
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,540
Your imagination?

182
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,570
Could you make an association hook that could get you back to them in a little while?

183
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,390
I will share with you.

184
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,540
