00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Okay,

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.890
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.300
Location on DSO become to our second key location.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.750
And the chances are if I asked you what you had for breakfast yesterday,

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.370
you would instantly be transported back to your kitchen at home.

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.280
As you recall.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.450
What?

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.600
It was you eight.

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.650
Similarly,

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.420
if I asked you about lunch,

11
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.700
you may find yourself in the canteen at work and dinner.

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.230
Well,

13
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.980
maybe he tried that new Thai place in the high street.

14
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.320
Now the sequence is naturally preserved by the location.

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.090
If you can't instantly recall the meal,

16
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.080
you could think yourself back to the location.

17
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.040
And from there,

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.250
get to what it was that you ate.

19
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.570
Remember the context we learned about in the signs?

20
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.030
A lecture?

21
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.830
If we wanted to memorize the order of the American presidents,

22
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.930
it would be helpful to have a pre defined route where we could go to drop George Washington

23
00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.930
.

24
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.870
That position one.

25
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.750
John Adams at position to Thomas Jefferson at three.

26
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.820
And so one or the key points to a speech you have to give No,

27
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.950
no,

28
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.010
no.

29
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.320
Please.

30
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.910
Location.

31
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.430
A great way to preserve sequence is also useful for grouping things.

32
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.970
We wish to remember it just makes sense.

33
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.590
You probably keep all your knives,

34
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.370
forks and spoons in the same drawer,

35
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.750
right?

36
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.150
If we wanted to memorize all of the American state capitals,

37
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.910
wouldn't it be useful if we had that information all in one place?

38
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.750
That way,

39
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.400
if someone asks What's the capital of Illinois?

40
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.410
You can instantly go to your mental American state capital place on Retrieve the answer.

41
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.310
Springfield.

42
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.750
Now looking for us,

43
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.450
we probably already have a bunch of Germany's stored in our memory.

44
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.750
Even if we hadn't thought of used them for this purpose before,

45
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.790
we certainly can.

46
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.220
Now,

47
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.110
each of those journeys those roots will have distinct and discrete points that you could

48
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.550
latch onto and use telling something that you want to remember.

49
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.080
You will have a root toe work you could mentally walk around your school,

50
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.710
that holiday resort that you love so much it doesn't even have to be Really.

51
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.730
You could have a route through video game,

52
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.550
providing you know it well enough.

53
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.420
Using their amazing power of association.

54
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.710
We're going to link items we want to memorize to specific locations along our journey and

55
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.870
together started.

56
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.230
I want you to map out a route with 10 stops,

57
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.920
10 distinct and separate white points that you were going to use to memorize 10 random

58
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.850
items just for fun.

59
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.160
What I want you to do here is take a few minutes to map out a route with 10 locations or

60
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.670
distinct way points to make this easy.

61
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.140
Let's start where you start the day waking up in your bedroom so your bedroom is positioned

62
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.550
one.

63
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.320
Perhaps the first thing you do after you wake is go to the loo,

64
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.620
said the bathroom.

65
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.290
Maybe location to.

66
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.350
After that,

67
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.310
you probably wash your hands so position three could be the sink on.

68
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.690
May be,

69
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.500
then you go downstairs on the stairway.

70
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.870
Could be positioned for the bottom of the stairs.

71
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.950
The hallway could be position five,

72
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.570
maybe then go into the living room and put the breakfast news on.

73
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.980
And that's number six,

74
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.290
then into the kitchen to put the cat one.

75
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.650
Number seven and so on.

76
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.060
It doesn't matter if you run out of rooms,

77
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.850
you can always go outside,

78
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.210
so take the next couple of minutes.

79
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.380
Pause the lecture,

80
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.130
a map,

81
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.650
your journey of 10 distinct points when you already hit play and let's get this done.

82
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.010
Okay.

83
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.650
Got them.

84
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.370
Remember to tie each item to the location.

85
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.700
Ready There.

86
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.550
Let's begin.

87
00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:05.500
Item number one Giraffe ice swimming pool.

88
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:29.530
The non is football custard guitar.

89
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.250
Clint Eastwood,

90
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:48.370
handbag Chimney.

91
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.020
Okay,

92
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.620
there your 10 items.

93
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.180
Now let's run through those in order.

94
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.320
So what was the first item which is probably stored in your bedroom?

95
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.650
Can you return that?

96
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.680
It was giraffe.

97
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.270
And immediately after the giraffe,

98
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.590
we had ice.

99
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.450
And then from ice from position to we went to position three.

100
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.590
And there we had swimming pool.

101
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.210
And after swimming pool,

102
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.570
we had bananas.

103
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.850
After bananas,

104
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.550
we had football.

105
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.950
After football,

106
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.090
we had custard.

107
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.550
And after custody,

108
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.250
we had guitar.

109
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.970
And who did we have after guitar?

110
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.850
Clint Eastwood.

111
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.970
And after Clint Hand Bank and I finalize him.

112
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.470
Waas chimney.

113
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.270
Okay,

114
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.840
so that's the same less than I asked you to remember at the very start of the course.

115
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.960
How did you do this time?

116
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.440
Was your school better?

117
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.520
Did you get all 10?

118
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.390
If you did,

119
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.590
that's amazing.

120
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.380
Well done.

121
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.290
But if not,

122
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.850
don't worry.

123
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.680
Because next,

124
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.310
we're gonna look at that third key to a perfect memory imagination on when she complete

125
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.900
that,

126
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.630
you'll be getting 10 8 to 10 every time.

127
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.470
Okay,

128
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
