1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Okay,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,980
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,220
You'll see an awful lot of downloads from this this course,

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,960
but I wanted to give you this as well.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,790
And this is what I used to build your downloads.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,120
Now,

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,590
what we have here is a simple Excel spreadsheet template,

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,590
and this one's particularly geared,

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,750
or this one's set up to be 100 lines long.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,510
So if you have something that you need to memorize,

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,480
you can put it into your study plan On the off screen I have all the capitals of the United

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,030
States was.

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,950
I'm just gonna copy.

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,460
I'm gonna click in here on the right,

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,120
click and juice pay special,

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,850
and they're all my American state capital.

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,910
So I'm just going to type up here state.

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,450
And I'm just going type over here can be towel.

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,770
No,

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,000
because I only need 50 lines.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,790
I'm just going to delete everything else that's below it.

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,280
So I'm just going to drag down,

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,560
right?

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,090
Click and hit.

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,580
Delete.

26
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,890
This isn't a neck soul course,

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,070
though.

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,750
I do have some amazing excelled courses.

29
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,000
Do check them out.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,750
And I'm just gonna put a thick border around that.

31
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,480
So they go.

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,420
That looks all pretty.

33
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,040
So you have you state your capital.

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,260
Let's just line those up on here.

35
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,490
You have your comments.

36
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,320
This is where you can write details about your No Monix.

37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,810
Now,

38
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,810
if you need to,

39
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,090
you can change the template name here.

40
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,950
But if you put it up in here,

41
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,100
American State Cappie Towels.

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,000
When we flip over to the revision plan,

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,030
you'll notice that it has pulled the title over with it.

44
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,170
And it has also pulled all the values that we had in the first sheet,

45
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,580
so you don't need to type them out again.

46
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,400
Now again,

47
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,300
this is set up for 100 lines,

48
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,240
but I'm just going to delete everything.

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,450
Bill low there.

50
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,410
So it's going to right.

51
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,770
Click and delete from Andi for pretty in the sake on the part of thick box around that

52
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,190
again.

53
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,970
OK,

54
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,160
so here is your revision plan in the Yellow Cell,

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
insert today's date and sell seasick,

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,030
so today's 31st of the eighth and you can see that your optimum revision plan has already

57
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,090
been calculated for you.

58
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,570
So today immediate assumes you've learnt it.

59
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,710
Do your revision.

60
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,010
Take the test.

61
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:23,080
If you don't want to see the ounces here you can always right click on choose Hide.

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,520
So we have one day,

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
three days,

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,880
seven days after that.

65
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,230
14 days after that,

66
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,310
among three months.

67
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,200
Six months.

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,410
You will never forget anything if you follow this revision plan.

69
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,350
So just to show you how this works,

70
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:47,670
If we went Teoh to where we Alabama and put mult grant OPEC and spelled Montgomery and his

71
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,210
enter,

72
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:54,020
we get a green on 2% because we got one of our 50 answers.

73
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,470
Right?

74
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,080
But if we went to Alaska and typed Texas and hit enter,

75
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,250
you can see that that goes red.

76
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,580
Now,

77
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,180
obviously,

78
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,580
for the more that you get right,

79
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,480
you get more greens,

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,790
get them.

81
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,320
All right,

82
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,780
You get 100%.

83
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,140
I suggest that once you've done your first revision plan,

84
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,560
let me just delete those on unhygienic.

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,030
There we go.

86
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,220
Once you've done your immediate revision plan,

87
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,600
just hide that and hide that on.

88
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,850
Then carry on with this,

89
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,300
and if you need to print it out,

90
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,160
you can print it out easily.

91
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,250
On that is your revision template.

92
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,860
Okay,

93
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,550
I'll see you in the next lecture.
