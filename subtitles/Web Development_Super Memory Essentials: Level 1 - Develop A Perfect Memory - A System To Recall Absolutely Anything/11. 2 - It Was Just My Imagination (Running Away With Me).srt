1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
Okay,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,560
guys,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,770
welcome back.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:12,460
It was just my imagination running away with me while our minds are drawn to the unusual.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,340
Even when we did the baseline test at the very beginning of the course,

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,320
I bet you got Clint Eastwood.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,100
Why?

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,050
Because Clint was the odd man out.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,970
Clinton's unusual in the context of the other items that I gave you more unique than the

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,150
other unique items.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,150
If you know what I mean more memorable,

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,830
something stand out automatically on that makes them difficult to forget,

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,650
as was the case reclaimed eastward.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,140
But cast your mind back to the science.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,770
A lecture,

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,380
that part where I said that our minds capture multiple reference points as we learn

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,590
something well,

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,980
what we're going to do now is maximize that to our benefit.

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,650
Can you think of anything else that would make something memorable?

20
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,120
Well,

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,860
knowledge,

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:06,390
something that we are already familiar with novelty is another one uniqueness.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,950
How unusual is it?

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,340
Emotion.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,580
Does it stimulate your emotions?

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,000
Does it make you laugh?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,760
Exaggeration makes something unusually big or small or any other exaggeration guaranteed to

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,540
make it memorable senses.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,100
We use these automatically sight,

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,730
sound,

31
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,260
touch,

32
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,890
smell,

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,120
taste and if you can incorporate that when you're remembering something,

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,310
you'll have multiple trigger points.

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,430
And sex.

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,230
Sex is a great aid to memory.

37
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,190
Enough set.

38
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:45,750
You can even remember that using the pneumonic Mies with an extra S at the end.

39
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,550
Now the best thing about our imagination is that it's completely private.

40
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,220
We can apply any amount of imagination we like to what we want to remember.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,640
We can link to something we already know,

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,650
making novel,

43
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,550
emotional,

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,380
exaggerated call in all our senses or make it sexy.

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,090
In fact,

46
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,540
the more of those things we can pour into it,

47
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,080
the more reference points or triggers will have and the more memorable it will be.

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,580
It's worth noting that your trigger doesn't need to be precise,

49
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,180
just as long as it gets you back to the thing you're trying to recall.

50
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,890
When I recall the Spanish word for waitress,

51
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,660
I immediately picture a waitress with a camera around the neck.

52
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,880
The actual word is camera,

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,270
but camera gets me most of the way,

54
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,450
and then it's just a short step to get to camera.

55
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,290
In the next lecture,

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,800
we're going to combine everything we've already learned,

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,120
and we will use that to memorize the 10 Commandments forwards backwards and in any order.

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,770
Okay,

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
