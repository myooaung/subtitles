00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
guys,

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.100
I'm welcome back.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.410
Greek mythology,

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.600
the Titans.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.000
Now I'm always impressed by people who know a little bit about ancient mythology.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.700
To me,

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.450
just speaks of a first class education,

8
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.700
even just knowing who is the god of what is plenty enough to get you started.

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.630
So if you don't know your mask from Uranus and choose that,

10
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.040
say you pronounce that,

11
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.160
then this is the section for you as we soar in the faces section.

12
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.960
Once you have one thing firmly anchored in your memory,

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.270
you can utilize that tow hook other pieces of related information onto if you need to,

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.450
deep in your knowledge.

15
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.440
To that end,

16
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.130
there are a few bonus deep in your knowledge lectures just to add a few extra extra

17
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.450
interest in facts.

18
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.790
If that's not your thing,

19
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.050
feel free to skip them.

20
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.950
Okay,

21
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.160
so in this section,

22
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.710
we will cover.

23
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.620
The Big 12.

24
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.830
Date is of ancient mythology,

25
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.170
starting with the Greeks,

26
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.590
the Titans and the Olympians,

27
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
and finishing with the Romans as a point of mythological history.

28
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.650
The Greek golds were around before the Romans,

29
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.560
so when things get confusing,

30
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.750
no,

31
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.870
in the Greek and the Roman gods for war,

32
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.820
we'll know,

33
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.640
and that's because we gonna store them in completely different places in your memory palace

34
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.640
.

35
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.240
You wouldn't confuse your own kitchen with your aunt.

36
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.490
Mabel's garden would shift course now.

37
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.820
So for the Greeks,

38
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.160
you will need to roots one for the Titans on one.

39
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.120
For the rock stars of Greek mythology,

40
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.830
the Olympians you need to separate routes is you wouldn't want the Titans and the Olympians

41
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.230
mixing with each other.

42
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.650
There's enough of that going on as you'll soon see Sophia First Route.

43
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.290
The one for the Titans featured the Titanic somewhere at the beginning.

44
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.860
That way you'll always remember that these are the Titans as these.

45
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.080
The Greeks pick a place that you would instantly associate with Greece if you visit to the

46
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.330
country and conform a familiar route with 12 stops.

47
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.250
Fantastic.

48
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.350
If you know someone who's Greek,

49
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.730
could you use a route around their house?

50
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.450
Or do you have a favorite Greek restaurant?

51
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.300
Whatever you choose is fine,

52
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.230
as long as you have 12 distinct points along your journey.

53
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.970
If you haven't do that now,

54
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.710
when you're ready,

55
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.690
come back and let's get started.

56
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.860
Now remember,

57
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.200
if I'm going too fast,

58
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.250
you can always pause the lecture.

59
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.110
Okay.

60
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.070
Cronus,

61
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.150
King of the Titans and God of Time now incorporate Compass into this image.

62
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.550

63
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.970
Queen of the Titans.

64
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.760
A mother of the gods and goddess of female fertility Hyperion,

65
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.190

And again incorporate Compass into this image.

69
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.570
Phoebe,

70
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.050
Goddess of prophecy.

71
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.720
Oh,

72
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.630

creates God of heavenly constellations.

76
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.030
And again,

77
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.950
at a compass into this image.

78
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.200
My appetite s God of craftsmanship.

79
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.450
Immortality on again at a compass to this image.

80
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.040

81
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.550

Order and justice.

84
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.830
Okay,

85
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.460
got them.

86
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.050
Let's do a quick review.

87
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.350
Who is the King of the Titans and God of Time?

88
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.720
Cronus on the queen of the Titans,

89
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.250
Mother of the gods and goddess of female fertility.

90
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.300
Ria on what was Hyperion?

91
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:58.190
The God off the God of light On the gun s of site CIA and KIIS was the god off in selecting

92
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.450
intelligence on the goddess of prophecy was Phoebe.

93
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.800
Oh,

God of heavenly constellations creates and I apparatus was the goal of craftsmanship.

97
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.150
Immortality.

98
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:42.850
Nem assigned was the goddess of memory on the goddess of divine law,

99
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.200
order and justice.

100
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.910
Waas Themis Okay,

101
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.680
How did you do?

102
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.970
If he struggled with any,

103
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.210
perhaps she could still some of Mina Monix.

104
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.550
Here's how I remember them.

105
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.790
Cronus,

106
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.050
being the king is wearing a crown.

107
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.450
You also looks at his watch a lot as he's the god of time.

108
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.270
Rhea.

109
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.350
I think of Rhianna dressed as the queen and she has a huge bumper.

110
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.200
She's pregnant,

111
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.950
both mother and fertility.

112
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.990
Hyperion.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.100

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.960

116
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.420
Site KIIS.

117
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.870
I have Einstein intellect with a set of keys.

118
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:41.220
Phoebe Phoebe from the TV show Friends dressed as a fortune teller prophecy.

119
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.050
Oh,

120
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.850
she Alanis Ocean reminds me of the ocean,

121
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.440
and he's the God of the seas.

122
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.510
Testis.

123
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.240
I have a nurse nursing with huge teeth.

124
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.150
Tether to a tap running water creates.

125
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.770
I have my friend Chris line on top of a Prius,

126
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.330
looking at the stars constellations I appetites.

127
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.790
I have a yapping pet with half moon glasses chiseling a tombstone.

128
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.660
Both craftsmanship on mortality Never sign.

129
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.710
This is where we hit the term demonic from meaning memory technique and Sam Iss.

130
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.230
I imagine people throwing things at scales law,

131
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.540
but they miss premise a gay were help.

132
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.420
Whatever happened to the Titans?

133
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.400
All of the Titan Children had the same parents.

134
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.840
Uranus or Uranus,

135
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.450
The devotee and Gaia Mother Earth.

136
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.100
Now,

137
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.950
the times came to be gods.

138
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.720
As Cronus hatched a plot to depose his father.

139
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.570
He and his three brothers or three of his brother sneakily hidden at the four corners of

140
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.190
the earth doesn't remind you of a compass.

141
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:54.570
Now,

142
00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:00.960
when Uranus Dan came down to visit Mother Earth ambushed him on Cronus castrated his father

143
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.960
,

144
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.150
thereby seizing power and becoming king himself.

145
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.160
Can you guess who the other three brothers were?

146
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.550
Four corners of the Earth compass.

147
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:17.070
It was Cronus Key s creates and I appetites all the images with compass.

148
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.310
OK,

149
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:24.290
but Mother Earth one Cronus that the same thing had happened to him that his Children would

150
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.230
deposing if he wasn't careful.

151
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.310
He thought that he had a way around that.

152
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.450
But we'll come to that in the next lecture.

153
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.200
Okay,

154
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.950
I'll see you in the next lecture.
