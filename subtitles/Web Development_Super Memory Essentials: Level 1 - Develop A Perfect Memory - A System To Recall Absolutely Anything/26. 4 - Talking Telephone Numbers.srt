1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,970
Okay,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,500
guys.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,300
And welcome back talking telephone numbers.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,850
Now we're going to expand on the Dominic system and I'll show you how can you can utilize

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,000
it to memorize even longer numbers by stacking.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,280
We're going to take a phone number of a very well known organization on one.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,080
I hope you never have occasion to call Interpol into pulse phone number.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,880
ISS plus 33 47 24 47.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,240
Double +00 Let's put that into a table civilly.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,950
Looks like.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,700
Okay,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,750
this is what it is.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,810
No,

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,380
the memorizing and 11 digit number may seem daunting at first blush,

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,010
by stacking that is,

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,750
combining one person's action with another persons person.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,750
We actually only need three stages toe our journey.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,770
33 equal Sisi,

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,920
who could be Charlie Chaplin,

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,710
Charlie's Action or Prop is swinging his walking cane,

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,390
but today he's not going to be doing that.

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,050
Otherwise,

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,650
we'd have 33 33.

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:17,170
47 equals DG equals Danny Glover on I Use that famous scene from Lethal Weapon two,

25
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,740
where he faces off with Joss.

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,690
Ackland just claims diplomatic immunity,

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,450
and Danny stretches his neck and say's has just been revoked.

28
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,740
So when Charlie Chaplin,

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,210
33 stretches his neck and say's It's just been revoked.

30
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,450
47

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,750
We have the person 33 on the action of 47 1 scene four digits.

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,680
Next,

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,650
we have 24 47 24 equals B D equals Bob Dylan,

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,650
and he's normally playing a harmonica on a brace.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,410
But today,

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,520
his stretching his neck and saying,

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,350
You guessed it has just been revoked.

38
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,040
That scene to know we have eight digits in the bag.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,790
Finally,

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,700
we have Ozzie Osborne with a football or a hero,

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,190
depending on where the use the number,

42
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,960
shape or number.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,890
Rime system.

44
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,950
So that gives us seen one.

45
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,860
Charlie Chaplin,

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,810
33

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,250
Danny Glover's Action 47.

48
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,030
Seen to Bob Dylan,

49
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,840
24

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,190
Danny Glover's Action 47.

51
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,450
Seen three.

52
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,300
Ozzie Osborne 00 playing with a football zero.

53
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:33,450
So 33 47 24 47 000 is into pulse phone number.

54
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,460
I'll see you in the next lecture
