1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,370
Okay,

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,900
guys.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,550
And welcome back.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,610
The Dominic System and the Dominic system was developed by a fellow Brit,

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,810
Dominic O Brien,

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,190
on,

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,470
like,

8
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,130
the major system and also relies on converting numbers to something more memorable.

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,230
But this time,

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,040
ultimately,

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,550
people.

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,180
Now,

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,920
in my view,

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,400
this was a stroke of genius by Mr O Brien as people and much easier to remember,

15
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,370
we have no trouble at all making a picture of a person.

16
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,090
As with the major system,

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,590
each number is converted to a letter that the Dominic system has a much simpler logical

18
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:38,920
released,

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,800
I think so.

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,650
Those letters then become the initials of someone memorable.

21
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,450
And that's how you get to the person.

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,120
Dominic O Brien also went one step further.

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,280
Each person will have a unique action or prop associated with them,

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,080
making it easy to stack multiple pairs of numbers,

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,850
making memorize longer numbers much simpler.

26
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,640
So I'll show you what I mean in a second.

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,050
But first here is the number toe letter key.

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,110
And as you can see,

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,340
it's very simple.

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,950
A B C D e a numbers one through 56 is s because it's a strong s word.

31
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,450
Seven and eight G and H.

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,810
Just like in alphabet nine is a strong n word and zero is Oh,

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,640
so they go.

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,280
It's that simple to memorize a B C D e s g h n onda.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,470
So if you know your alphabet,

36
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,520
then you're already 80% of the way there.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:41,990
See,

38
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,090
I told you it was easy.

39
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,050
The one thing to nose here is that if you can make an instant association between a number

40
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,920
on a person,

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,470
go with that over the system.

42
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,580
So 07 may well mean you need to find someone with the initials O and G,

43
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,270
But you probably think of James Bond first.

44
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,150
So use that now.

45
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,910
Similarly,

46
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,350
people of a certain age will possibly remember the movie 10 with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek

47
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,350
.

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,300
So for 10 I would go with Dudley Moore Qusai instantly associating with the movie I still

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,820
keep Bo.

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,890
Derek is 24 though I have an entirely separate action for Bo Derek.

51
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,660
Now,

52
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,040
all of the numbers in the Dominic system are double digit numbers.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,990
So 66 would give us S s on.

54
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,780
There are a few famous people with those initials with Sharon Stone,

55
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,760
Sylvester Stallone Steven Spielberg.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,450
I'm gonna go with Sharon Stone.

57
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,260
So you may recall me saying that each person has a unique action or prop associated with

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,480
them.

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,710
Will My unique action for Sharon Stone is that famous crossing the legs,

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,960
Seen from Basic Instinct.

61
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,910
Stay with me here.

62
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,490
So the Battle of Hastings was in 10.

63
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,980
66 to remember that using the Dominic system,

64
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,210
I have an image that reminds me of the Battle of Hastings,

65
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,410
D.

66
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,620
C.

67
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:02,780
I,

68
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,590
Hastings from line of duty in battle.

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,950
And in that scene I have Dudley Mawr 10 crossing his legs provocatively.

70
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,810
The action for the lovely Sharon Stone.

71
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,840
So Dude,

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,770
crossing his legs is 10 and 66 therefore I can get back to 10 66 see how easy that is.

73
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:31,260
So if I need to remember 66 10 I would have Sharon Stone playing the piano as Dudley Moore

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,850
was a virtuoso pianist,

75
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,080
and that's the action I have for him.

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,010
I warn you that this system requires you to do the work up front.

77
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:47,750
You will need to map all 100 pairs of digits from 00 to 99 with corresponding unique action

78
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,590
or props now this could take a while to do,

79
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,520
but the investment is worth it.

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,720
As once it's done,

81
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,980
it's always with you.

82
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,230
As always,

83
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,050
there is a downloadable resource with suggestions for famous people you can use with this

84
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,600
course.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,150
But as I mentioned earlier,

86
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,420
if you have an instant link between the number on a person,

87
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,980
use that first in the download.

88
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,720
That will also be a link to a website that will give you a bunch of other suggestions for

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,250
people.

90
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,860
Okay,

91
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,310
I'll see you in the next lecture.
