00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
Okay,

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.670
guys,

3
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.070
I'm welcome back of the science.

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.280
CeBIT hell,

5
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.450
we store information naturally.

6
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.070
Now,

7
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.740
computer store data in a sequential fashion.

8
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.340
When you hit save button,

9
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.180
you'll be storing a specific piece of data,

10
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.220
a letter photo and MP three,

11
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.120
a movie with a specific name in a specific location.

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.450
You probably have some kind of filing system where all your music is stored in the same

13
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.860
place on all your photos in another.

14
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.370
Now,

15
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.010
this is very convenient.

16
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.090
But to get back to that photo to recall it,

17
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
you're going to need to navigate the precise path to where you stored it.

18
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.810
If you look somewhere else,

19
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.870
it won't be there.

20
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.890
If you go to your music folder,

21
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.860
there will be no clues saying,

22
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.240
Hey,

23
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.620
were you looking for that photo?

24
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.390
Try looking in the photos folder.

25
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.760
Luckily for us,

26
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.950
our brains don't work that way.

27
00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.040
When we remember something that is store something for later retrieval,

28
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.680
we write that information to our brain using multiple reference points across the different

29
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.790
senses simultaneously.

30
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.990
Not only that,

31
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.820
but each of the various reference points are inextricably linked to each other.

32
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.030
Neurologically essentially,

33
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.590
they become hardwired.

34
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.150
This is regardless of where physically in the brain they are stored.

35
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.270
Further,

36
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.860
any existing reference points are also linked.

37
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.550
Associate ID to the new information,

38
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.940
which creates an intricate and unique tapestry of our experiences.

39
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.730
Better yet,

40
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.200
for us,

41
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.060
in our quest for a perfect memory,

42
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.740
we can utilize that interconnectedness toe access that photo even if we're looking in the

43
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.670
wrong place.

44
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.550
Unlike a computer,

45
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.450
if I think back to my childhood Adan Auntie Olga,

46
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.030
I can't get ready to my head neck.

47
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.540
She actually wasn't my auntie,

48
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.500
but anyone significantly older than me was an aunt or an uncle back then.

49
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.470
So Auntie Olga had that white cat like blow felts.

50
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.070
She baked great muffins.

51
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.330
She also used to smoke cigarettes in her conservatory.

52
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.700
At the back of her house,

53
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.600
she had a record player that you could slide records into vertically.

54
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.430
If I close my eyes,

55
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.050
I could go back in time to that conservatory.

56
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.950
Smell the cigarette smoke,

57
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.120
taste the muffin,

58
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.140
stroke the cat.

59
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.520
I can even walk around a house.

60
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.980
A complete wealth of sensory information comes flooding backers.

61
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.160
If I were there right now,

62
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.400
now it could access that memory using any of those reference points or triggers.

63
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.960
I may pass someone smoking a cigarette,

64
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.950
smell the smoke and make the jump.

65
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.680
I could see a white cat.

66
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.920
I may even see some all records stood up vertically on.

67
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.750
That could be enough to drift away right back to my childhood.

68
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.480
Now,

69
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.100
of course,

70
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.180
to us all this information is just context.

71
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.520
But our brains,

72
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.170
it's not.

73
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.110
Our brains do not intuitively know which elements of something we need to retrieve later,

74
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.920
so it captures a bunch of different data points simultaneously,

75
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.950
as we learn.

76
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.740
So you'll recall the description,

77
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.450
their inherent storage capacity from Scientific American I mentioned a little earlier.

78
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.170
It said New Ron's combined so that each one helps with many memories at a time,

79
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.200
exponentially increasing the brain's memory storage capacity to something closer to around

80
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.580
2.5.

81
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.350
Petabytes now just isn't aside.

82
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.090
As I mentioned this quote you again or you read the words on the screen.

83
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.150
Can you recall anything else from the first time you heard or read it?

84
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.620
Where were you?

85
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.190
How you sitting?

86
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.880
What was the weather like?

87
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.740
Was it warm?

88
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.570
Was it cool?

89
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.790
We're hungry.

90
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.890
Could you smell something cooking?

91
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.860
Could you hear kids playing outside in the street.

92
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.460
The chances are that you will recall something beyond the quote itself,

93
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.090
though,

94
00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.950
as an example,

95
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.770
smelling your casserole cooking in the oven is not relevant to the quote.

96
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.980
That piece of data was stored right along with it.

97
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.150
Well,

98
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.710
that's this inaction.

99
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.220
Now,

100
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.420
the scientific term for this process of writing multiple data points and interconnectedness

101
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.170
is called into leaving.

102
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.360
And we're gonna exploit this to its full potential to make our memory stronger.

103
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.010
More on that later.

104
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.920
Okay,

105
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
