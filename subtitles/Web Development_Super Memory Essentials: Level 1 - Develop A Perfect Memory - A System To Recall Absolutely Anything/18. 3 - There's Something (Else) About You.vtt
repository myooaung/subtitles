00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Okay,

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.460
guys.

3
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.040
And welcome back.

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.960
There's something else about you,

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.940
okay?

6
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.490
People just love it when you remember their name.

7
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.200
It shows that you cared enough in the first place.

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.520

10
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.840

interest in fact about themselves,

14
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.550
not all of which were fit for public consumption.

15
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.700
All you need to do to take this additional tidbit of information to them is pick out a

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.040
keyword and drop it right in there with their scene with them Ready.

17
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040

24
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.750
and even I didn't know that about him.

25
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:17.180

34
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.080

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.570
Claire Selwyn has never missed an episode of N.

36
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.120

I s Richard Leggett is a musician in his spare time,

38
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.950
and I never knew that.

39
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.530
