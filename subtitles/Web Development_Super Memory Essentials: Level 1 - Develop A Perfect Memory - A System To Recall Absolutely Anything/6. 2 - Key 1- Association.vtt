00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Okay,

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.820
guys.

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.750
And welcome back Key Number one Association,

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.870
as I mentioned in the last lecture,

5
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.250
something's and naturally memorable to either everyone or to us personally.

6
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.290
And the wonderful thing about the way we think is it's not linear and mines bones off on

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.730
all kinds of tangents.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.960
It will make connections,

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.150
associations.

10
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.010
We just can't help ourselves with some things.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.890
Almost everyone's mind will make the same instant connections,

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.930
and somewhere in there will be connections that only we could make us individuals.

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.110
Now double 07 is a great example on here in the digits double 07 Almost everyone will think

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.130
of James Bond.

15
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.940
Maybe even hear the theme to Dr Know,

16
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.830
perhaps Daniel Craig,

17
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.890
Sean Connery,

18
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.960
Sir Roger Moore,

19
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.310
Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby.

20
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.670
And from here,

21
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.830
we can let our minds run free.

22
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.250
Maybe we make the short leap to bond baddies.

23
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.150
Blow felt he was my favorite,

24
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.120
played in the first instance by Donald Pleasants.

25
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.130
He had that white Katty was always stroking.

26
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.200
He loved that cat.

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.760
My auntie Olga had a white cat just like that.

28
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.250
Auntie Olga used to make the best muffins I've ever eaten.

29
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920
There's a great cafe in town.

30
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.780
That's so amazing.

31
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.020
Muffins to I stopped off their toe.

32
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.590
Have one.

33
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.290
When I got off the train the last time I came from visiting London I was in London because

34
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.900
had that meeting with Khloe Khloe I haven't seen for a while.

35
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.120
I wonder how she's doing.

36
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.280
I'll give her a call tonight to check in.

37
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.030
See what I mean?

38
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.210
I got from three digits toe wondering how my friend Chloe was doing that.

39
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.430
Took a while to say It happened in a few seconds in my head.

40
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.960
And that is the very process we're going to tap into now,

41
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.370
though,

42
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.440
hopefully with not as many stages.

43
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.420
So let's start off with a couple of easy ones.

44
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.470
I'm gonna give you two things to remember,

45
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.030
and I want you to form an association between the two.

46
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050
Ready Pamela Anderson,

47
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.150
red swimsuit.

48
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.370
Okay,

49
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.290
that was an easy one.

50
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.550
Try this gorilla piano.

51
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.050
Okay,

52
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.910
so that's a little more tricky.

53
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.130
Unless you already happen to know a piano playing gorilla.

54
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.580
But what if you were to close your eyes for a second on picture a gorilla playing the piano

55
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.580
?

56
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.020
Go on,

57
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.290
close your eyes for just a few seconds and imagine that crazy scene.

58
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.420
So now if I said gorilla,

59
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.880
could you get to piano?

60
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.850
You probably could.

61
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.260
And the trick here is not to try too hard.

62
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.910
If you can make an instant association,

63
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.780
go with it.

64
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.020
If something popped into your head immediately,

65
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.050
this time the chances are it will the next time to it doesn't matter if it would make sense

66
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.660
to me,

67
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.790
your postman or your cousin Bob.

68
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.850
It only has to work for you.

69
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.490
Okay,

70
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:23.220
let's try a couple more pineapple Michael Jordan again,

71
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.250
The next pair,

72
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:44.780
Magic wand bread and our last pair Venus Cornflakes.

73
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.880
Okay,

74
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.450
lets go back over those and see how you did.

75
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.130
So the first pair were pineapple.

76
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.250
Andi Michael Jordan.

77
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.950
Did you manage to make an association between those two completely unrelated things?

78
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.260
Maybe you imagined eating a pineapple,

79
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.790
and then MJ took it from you and started shooting hoops with it.

80
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.170
Or maybe imagine cutting open a pineapple and inside instead of the fruit was a tiny

81
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.150
Michael Jordan trying to escape.

82
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.070
Whatever you came up with is perfectly fine.

83
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.110
So how about the next pair?

84
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.570
Magic wand?

85
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.950
Andi bread.

86
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.480
Perhaps you might imagine needing bread with the wand Or maybe getting bread out of an oven

87
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.170
with the paddle that had a magic wand as a handle.

88
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.030
Or perhaps you even used a magic one to magic up some delicious freshly baked bread.

89
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.090
Okay,

90
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.590
on the final pair.

91
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.470
Venous Andi cornflakes.

92
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.840
Okay,

93
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.100
Now,

94
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.760
here.

95
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.800
Venus could have bean the planet.

96
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.560
Or perhaps she thought of the statue.

97
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.580
Venus de Millo.

98
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.140
Well,

99
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.230
that famous Renee songs painting the Birth of Venus by BOTTICELLI or the tennis player

100
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.650
Venus Williams.

101
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.020
Or if you're a woman,

102
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.710
there's a razor for women called Venus.

103
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.650
How did you tell your image?

104
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.000
Four.

105
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.950
Venus to cornflakes.

106
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.200
Whatever you came up with is just perfect for you.

107
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.050
It doesn't matter if the link you made makes no sense to anyone else as long as it works

108
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.520
for you.

109
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.860
So that's association the A of Ali.

110
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.050
But did you notice one else we did there?

111
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.450
We also included the I imagination.

112
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.810
We took two completely unrelated items on.

113
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.840
By applying a little imagination,

114
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.870
we managed to forge a link where the wasn't one.

115
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.020
So thinking of the first automatically lead us to think of the second Now,

116
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.290
just for a minute or so.

117
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.420
I want you to pause the lecture and let those three scenes that you just made play out in

118
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.560
your mind in all their glory on when you're ready,

119
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.380
come back,

120
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.210
hit play,

121
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.550
and we'll wrap this one up.

122
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.400
Okay?

123
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.780
And well,

124
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.840
come back,

125
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.190
right.

126
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.870
You are already well on your way to becoming a memory machine,

127
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.560
but forewarned is forearmed,

128
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.190
as they say.

129
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.150
So now we're going to do our first test and also you after that.
