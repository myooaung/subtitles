1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690
Okay,

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,390
guys.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,750
And welcome back introduction to the language section.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,130
So learning a foreign language is tough,

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,610
right?

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,270
It can take a lifetime to master.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:16,800
Now,

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,420
if we're talking about having complete command of all the intricacies and new insists of a

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,290
foreign tongue,

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,430
that may be true.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,810
But by that school,

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,770
I can't even speak English yet.

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,050
But I seem to get by on that,

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,690
I think,

15
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,250
is one of the reasons that many adults have put off trying to learn a second language.

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,220
Now I say second deliberately because once you've got number two under your belt,

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,550
number three isn't so daunting.

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,520
A number four easiest still years ago had a debate with the lady had been study in Spanish

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,670
for five years.

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,270
She said that in order to be understood,

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,520
you must understand grammatical structure on be able to use it.

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,890
And she spent most of her time learning that before she began memorized in any words.

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,010
Now I agree the grammar is important to speak well,

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,190
but it kind of takes the fun out of it.

25
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,290
Who wants to study for a year before they actually learn to say anything?

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,760
They want to Well,

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
those with more patients than me.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,650
That should probably be more patients than I.

29
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,630
Now I think you can get off to a flying start by acquiring a bunch of useful words off

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,210
front.

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,270
At least you will have the basics of communication.

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,700
It may not be pretty,

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,840
but you'll be understood now.

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,790
I live near Birmingham in the UK,

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,910
and a lot of tourists from all over the world visit to shop in the bullring.

36
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,330
Now,

37
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,230
if someone approach me said Toilet,

38
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,070
where I would understand and direct them,

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,810
I wouldn't say,

40
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,160
Hey,

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,580
buddy,

42
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:44,960
you know,

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,630
that was a poorly form sentence,

44
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,180
donu.

45
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,290
So in this section,

46
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,220
we're gonna learn about 10 words in multiple languages.

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,540
Now,

48
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,930
you may be thinking that that will get confused him,

49
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,220
but we will store them in completely different places.

50
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,780
So for each language picker place,

51
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,050
you associate with that language and store your pictures there.

52
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,190
Let's begin with French.

53
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,550
I'll see you in the next lecture
