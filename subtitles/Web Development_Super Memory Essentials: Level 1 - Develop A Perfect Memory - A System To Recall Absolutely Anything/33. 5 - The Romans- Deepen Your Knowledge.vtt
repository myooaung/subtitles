00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
Okay,

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.000
guys on Welcome back,

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.980
the Romans,

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.210
Deep in your knowledge,

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.660
right?

6
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.100
It's time to add an interest,

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.550
in fact,

8
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
or two to your already impressive classical education.

9
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.310
You can use the 12 point route you just use.

10
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.680
Just find a way to tank what you're about to learn to.

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.550
The scenes you just created.

12
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.450
Remember,

13
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.800
Paused,

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.470
electrifying,

15
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.550
going too fast.

16
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.210
Ready?

17
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.600
Then let's do this.

18
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.760
Jupiter also overthrew his father and eighties babies.

19
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.860
Sound familiar?

20
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.960
Juno.

21
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.900
She was the protector of Roman women,

22
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.890
particularly married ones.

23
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:57.090
Neptune also renounce being a bad tempered man.

24
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.950
It must be a god of the sea thing.

25
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:08.470
Saris As Goddess of the Harvest,

26
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.270
Siri's is the origin of the word cereal.

27
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.050
Minerva,

28
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.280
born of Jupiter's head.

29
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.750
Does that sound familiar?

30
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:33.200
Apollo drove a chariot pulled by fiery horses.

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.870
Diana.

32
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.940
She could talk to the animals,

33
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:54.150
just like Dr Doolittle Mars.

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.040
Mars was the father of Rome,

35
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:05.610
Eolas and remiss Venus,

36
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910
born of the foam of the sea,

37
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:21.170
as in the paint in the birth of Venus Vulcan Vulcanology is a study of volcanoes you'll

38
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.630
remember.

39
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.550
Vulcan is the God of fire.

40
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:32.960
Mercury is the origin of the word merchant.

41
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.950
You remember mercury is the god of commerce and shop keeping.

42
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.380
And finally,

43
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.530
Bacchus,

44
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.620
his mother,

45
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.250
similarly was mortal.

46
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.200
Okay,

47
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.570
guys,

48
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.280
and well done.

49
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.420
I think that just about wraps up this section on mythology.

50
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.950
Be sure to impress your friends with your amazing knowledge of the Titans,

51
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.560
the Olympians and now the Romans.

52
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.220
Okay,

53
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.850
I'll see you in the next section.
