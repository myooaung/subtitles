00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
Okay,

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.210
guys,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.480
um,

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.570
welcome back.

5
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.680
The number Shape method.

6
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.880
Now,

7
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.200
how did you do in the quest?

8
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.670
I bet you aced it.

9
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.100
If no,

10
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.750
we have another simple system for single digit numbers coming up now.

11
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.690
Now the shapes that suggests here of the ones I use.

12
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.150
If you have a better idea,

13
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670
please just use that.

14
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.290
Ready.

15
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:36.250
Higos zero Football womb flagpole to swan.

16
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.430
Three handcuffs,

17
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.860
Full sail.

18
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:56.750
Boat five hook six elephants Trunk,

19
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.250
seven boomerang,

20
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.950
eight snowmen.

21
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.200
Nine.

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.650
Balloon on a string.

23
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.300
Okay,

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.000
got them.

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.350
Now let's put them to the test right now.

26
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.780
Picture each of these scenes for about 10 seconds.

27
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.330
How many moons does miles have to imagine the swan eating a Mars bar?

28
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.100
How many long,

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.700
stale belts did the boxer Henry Cooper win three.

30
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.350
Imagine Henry Cooper boxing in handcuffs.

31
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:54.050
How maney Gospels are there in the New Testament.

32
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.050
Four.

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.550
Imagine a gospel choir on a sailboat.

34
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:09.180
How many stars on the flag of Australia?

35
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.300
Six.

36
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.460
Imagine elephants singing at the Sydney all.

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.400
Perhaps because they're stars.

38
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:25.050
How many humans have set foot on the moon in the last decade?

39
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.360
Zero.

40
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.860
Imagine the moon as a football.

41
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.990
Okay.

42
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.760
It's worth noting that neither of the two systems we've looked at so far is better than the

43
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.100
other.

44
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.620
I personally used both into change,

45
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.980
Oblique.

46
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.570
If I had to go to the police station at 3 p.m. The handcuffs from the number shape system

47
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.410
would be a much more appropriate pneumonic than a tree.

48
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.150
See what I mean?

49
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.650
So if you have a favorite or you find one significantly easier to work with them,

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.140
the other go with that.

51
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.240
But have the other in reserve.

52
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.610
Okay,

53
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.440
One more quick quiz and then we're into the serious but fun stuff.

54
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.680
I'll see you after that.
