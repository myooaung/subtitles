1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
guys,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,150
I'm welcome back.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,590
The unusual is nothing to be afraid off phobias.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,780
So we've seen that by forming an association in our minds,

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,950
Using our knees on storing that information in their memory palace is pretty damn powerful

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,110
right now.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,030
I mentioned earlier about picturing a camera around the neck of a waitress to trigger the

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,160
Spanish word for rate waitress camera.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,570
Now,

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,140
that's simply enough because the camera on a waitress are easy pictures for us to imagine.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,770
But what if what you want to remember isn't something you can instantly visualize?

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,350
Well,

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,050
we just break it down until it is in this lecture,

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,570
we're gonna memorize a bunch of names of certain phobias which mostly have their roots in

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,190
Greek.

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,710
The easy part is the suffix.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,650
All phobias end with well,

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,350
phobia.

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,800
We just need a way to convert those tricky first parts.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,060
So if we took the word milana phobia,

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,900
which is the word for the fear of the color black,

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,330
Yes,

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,350
that's a real thing.

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,610
The phobia part is a given,

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,940
but what do we do about the melon?

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,160
Oh,

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,050
is there anything you can think of that could get you back to that?

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,120
Perhaps she would think of a melon.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,470
But instead of being yellow,

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,700
it's black for the beautiful Italian city of Milan on all Italian cities,

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,850
Beautiful except everything is painted black there,

32
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,150
or Gillette a phobia,

33
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,300
the fear of being laughed at.

34
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,240
What does the stem gelato remind you of?

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,720
Perhaps gelato that lovely Italian ice cream?

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,500
This is how I remember this one.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,230
Have a friend is a stand up comedian and he's rather portly and he does love gourmet ice

38
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,660
cream.

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,560
OK,

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,080
it's over to you again.

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,570
Pick a place in your memory palace to store 10 phobias.

42
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,450
Ready?

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,360
Okay,

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,410

Okay,

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,960
got them.

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,890
Let's have always through and see how you did again in no particular order.

So I'm going to give them to in the order that I just gave them to you.

63
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,580
Here are those 10.

64
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,410
Now I'm gonna mix it up a little bit,

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:46,800
Hex.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,900

67
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,350

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:21,650
Claustrophobia is the fear off enclosed spaces with no escape.

74
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,690

76
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,850

86
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,250
Okay,

87
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,050
here's how I remember them.

88
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,080
A Mecca phobia for scratched.

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,270
I think of the scene towards the end of Enter the Dragon where Bruce Lee has those

90
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,710
scratches on his chest.

91
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:36,110
But instead of fighting hard his fighting my friend Amy and she's delivering the scratches

92
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,650
with kung fu chops.

93
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,770
So I get a me and chop,

94
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,470
which is how it's spelled a Mecca phobia.

95
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,590
Okay for Astra phobia here,

96
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,550
I imagine a terrible thunderstorm,

97
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,990
but instead of lightning,

98
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,820
Vox's All Astra's are raining from the sky cause in a thunderous noise and sparks when they

99
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,220
hit the ground for claustrophobia.

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,480
This one is quite well known,

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,450
but I imagine Santa Clause,

102
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:05,620
which gives me the clause trapped in a tiny covered claustrophobia on Kalra phobia.

103
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,720
I imagine a bunch of clowns,

104
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,930
all wearing sunglasses cool on rowing,

105
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,100
cool row phobia,

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,150
Kalra phobia,

107
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,400
fear of clowns,

108
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,670
freak A phobia.

109
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,300
Quite simple.

110
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,930
This one ages.

111
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,990
Have a refrigerator with the door open,

112
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,850
making everything cold.

113
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,280
Joetta phobia.

114
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,720
I already told you about this on this is my friend,

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,050
the gelato munching stand up comedian.

116
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,230
Glass.

117
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,220
A phobia is this fear of public speaking,

118
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,010
and this is a speaker at a podium.

119
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,670
But he can't read these cue cards as the whole room is polished to a high gloss,

120
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,550
blinding him so glass o phobia is a fear of public speaking maleta phobia again.

121
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,440
As I said before,

122
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,240
I just have huge black melons.

123
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,920
Spectra phobia,

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,640
I imagine.

125
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,340
Someone wherein spectacles.

126
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,540
But instead of glass,

127
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,950
they have mirrors for lenses.

128
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,130
Just like cool hand Luke on xenophobia.

129
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,620
I imagine an alien from the Ridley Scott movies sitting like Buddha.

130
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,900
Very Zen.

131
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,200
Okay,

132
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,900
so that's 10 phobias committed to memory.

133
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,530
But again,

134
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,030
you can find a huge list is a downloadable resource from this lecture.

135
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,710
If you fancy a challenge,

136
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,280
we'll do one more quiz,

137
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,060
and then I'll show you one of the biggest memory problems ever faces.

138
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,960
Okay,

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,050
I'll see you soon.
