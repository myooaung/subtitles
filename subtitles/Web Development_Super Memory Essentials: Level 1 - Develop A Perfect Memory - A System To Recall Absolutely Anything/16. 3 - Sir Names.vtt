00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Okay,

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.200
guys.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000
And welcome back surnames.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.280
Now memorizing someone second name is not always necessary.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.830
If your friends introduce you to someone new when you're out,

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.110
they probably won't say,

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.570
Hey,

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.150
I'd like you to meet Nathaniel.

9
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.690
Talk win.

10
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.900
Admin is the third.

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.720
More likely you'll get.

12
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.950
This is Nathaniel.

13
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.640
Now,

14
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.910
this is really useful,

15
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.100
particularly in social situations.

16
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.550
Generally,

17
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.490
the English productions can come fast and furious,

18
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.180
so take advantage of the brevity and transport them off to an appropriate place will create

19
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.810
a hook you can use with your imagination.

20
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.390
Now,

21
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.750
in a business environment or more formal occasions,

22
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.370
you will often be given a first onda,

23
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.320
a last name and sometimes just the latter.

24
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.990
In these situations,

25
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.230
we often get a little more time with the people we've just met,

26
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.850
perhaps in a meeting or a conference.

27
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.590
We've already covered first names,

28
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.800
but for surnames,

29
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.450
we will need to get a little more creative.

30
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.400
Chances are that you will know more Michelle's than you do people with the surname of

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.050
Berryman.

32
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.220
Of course,

33
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.560
if you do happen to know someone named Berry Mint all the better,

34
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.130
just transport your Michelle to your Michelle place and have your Behrman there with her.

35
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.230
Now you may think that this could get confusing,

36
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.090
but trust me,

37
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.830
it won't providing you know your Mr or Mrs Behrman well enough.

38
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.830
I once met a Paul Presley he swapping guitar tips with Elvis at my cousins Have on.

39
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.850
I never mistakenly think Elvis is Paul.

40
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.610
So if you don't already know someone with the same surname again,

41
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.860
look for some instance,

42
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.620
association that you can make.

43
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.500
Does their names sound like something else?

44
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.290
Or can you break it down frenetically into a mini Seen All you need is a trigger to get

45
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.450
back to their name.

46
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.960
Let's take Bowman is an example.

47
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.550
Can you think of anything you can associate with that name?

48
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.900
Me,

49
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.730
I think of the TV Baker,

50
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.670
Mary Berry.

51
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.010
But when she speaks,

52
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.950
she has a really deep man's voice.

53
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.410
Now she would be at Michelle's desk,

54
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.690
a lady I used to work with,

55
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.250
taking cooking lessons from Mary Berry.

56
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.330
She's very surprised at how manly Mary's voice is,

57
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.590
and she's struggling.

58
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.550
No toe laugh.

59
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.320
OK,

60
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.960
but what about Blankman?

61
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.760
I have batmen for abatement.

62
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.110
Hi,

63
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.550
Laura.

64
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.620
That's a friend of mine.

65
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.210
Salt.

66
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.570
I think of self McDowell now from McDonnell.

67
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.350
I have a Big Mac skewered undoubtable ing.

68
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.410
What about Sang era?

69
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.890
I have a singing hero.

70
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.280
We'll put all this together in the next lecture where I'll show you.

71
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.300
A serious of self is of a bunch of my beautiful and handsome friends.

72
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.120
But for now,

73
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.420
let's have a practice at forming some associations on the second names and linking them to

74
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.470
the first names.

75
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.900
I'll give you the first name first and the second name Second with a few seconds between

76
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.810
each pair.

77
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.650
Okay,

78
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.350
poll,

79
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.270
Right.

80
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:24.050
Nicole Emerson Rubin.

81
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:48.360
Michael's Aisha could pool Luca Argento.

82
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:57.490
Violet Heathcote.

83
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.880
Okay,

84
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.180
let's see how you did.

85
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.930
I'm gonna give you those six again in a different order.

86
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.270
Sometimes the first name,

87
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.450
sometimes the last.

88
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.090
And you fill in the blanks.

89
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.550
Ready?

90
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:20.840
What was the first name off our Gento Luca on poles?

91
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.850
Second name.

92
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.780
We had poll,

93
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.280
right?

94
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.010
And what about the lady named Heathcote?

95
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:42.360
That was Violet Heathcote and Reuben was Ruben Michaels on What about Miss Emerson's first

96
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.780
name?

97
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.450
Nicole Emerson.

98
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.620
On what was Isha's last name Cap All I shake a poor.

99
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.380
Okay.

100
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.290
How did you do next?

101
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.520
I like you to meet some of my friends.

102
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.050
I'll see you in the next lecture
