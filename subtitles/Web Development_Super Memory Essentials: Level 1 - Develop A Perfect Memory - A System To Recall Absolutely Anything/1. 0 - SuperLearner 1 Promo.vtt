Hi.

2
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.650
My name's Alan on on the creator of this course,

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.200
Super in essentials.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.910
Level one.

5
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970
Develop a perfect memory.

6
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.880
So why should you learn from May?

7
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.220
In my early twenties,

8
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.260
I sat a series of 13 professional exams,

9
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.040
most of which I passed using what I already knew.

10
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.310
But they had a problem.

11
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.910
My contract law exam,

12
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.670
which I failed twice.

13
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.830
No matter how hard I stood it,

14
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.840
I seem to have a natural limitation to how much information I could stall.

15
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.360
Then I discovered that there were little known systems,

16
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.050
a select few people used to memorize vast amounts for information very quickly.

17
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.600
With perfect recall.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720
I read every book imprint I took.

19
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.450
What worked,

20
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.290
discarded what didn't until I,

21
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.640
too,

22
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680
had mastered the art of memory.

23
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440
So back to that lower example,

24
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.390
I studied for two nights and walked into the exam for the third time.

25
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.140
With 260 t cases,

26
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.400
I could fully site.

27
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400
I passed.

28
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.280
That was almost 30 years ago.

29
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.350
Now I can memorize anything with perfect recall,

30
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.550
and now I can share with you everything I've learned.

31
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.400
So what's inside the course?

32
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.680
Well,

33
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.270
everything you'll need our teach you how to encode information so that it can be recalled

34
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.080
instantly.

35
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.740
Always,

36
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.320
and you can use this system to memorize absolutely anything.

37
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.180
In fact,

38
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.050
just for fun.

39
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.930
This even a bunch of things that we will use in the course as you land,

40
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.030
such as how to memorize foreign languages.

41
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.370
The U S state and European capitals,

42
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.490
ancient Greek and Roman mythology,

43
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.580
names and faces,

44
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580
numbers and dates,

45
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.170
the planets in order.

46
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.240
Wedding anniversaries and birthdays,

47
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.220
the 10 Commandments,

48
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.010
the names of collective knowns and the names of phobias,

49
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.050
which should be enough to get you started.

50
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.700
So who is this course for anyone who wants to learn or study anything?

51
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.130
Anyone who wants a near photographic memory,

52
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.120
anyone taken exams and wants to pass some of these and anyone who wants to put the joy back

53
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.970
into learning.

54
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.190
So what are you gonna need to get started when you need three things?

55
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.200
A little time,

56
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.070
a willingness toe?

57
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.750
Have fun on a willingness to try something new.

58
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.500
Nothing else is needed,

59
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.820
as I will give you all the tools you need.

60
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.580
Take a look at the course description,

61
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.950
and I look forward to welcoming you to the course.

62
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.010
I'll see you in there
