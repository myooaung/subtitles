00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120
no way a 14 of the three keys to a perfect memory.

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.890
Okay,

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.370
guys,

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.820
unwelcome back.

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.780
Developing a perfect memory is not a matter of trying harder.

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.240
In fact,

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.210
trying harder is the last thing we should be doing.

8
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.980
It's counterproductive if what we're doing isn't working.

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.000
Doing more of the same isn't gonna make it any better.

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.290
Einstein had the clever quote about that now trying harder and not progressing just leads

11
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.240
to frustration.

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.820
And being frustrated is not the best state to be in.

13
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.690
If you want to learn,

14
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.800
something will get into what the best state is in here to get into it instantly a little

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.350
later.

16
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.430
Instead,

17
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610
it's a matter of trying something different.

18
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.750
In the last lecture,

19
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.930
we learned that our capacity for memories almost limitless.

20
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.340
What we need is a better way to recall information.

21
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.740
And the key to that lies in how we go about storing the information in the first place.

22
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.300
There's some things and naturally memorable to everyone and some things and naturally

23
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.550
memorable tow us as individuals.

24
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.150
Let's take a look at a very simple example.

25
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.740
Your bank has just issued you a new A T M card in a few days later,

26
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.790
your pin comes through the post.

27
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.430
Now you can change it.

28
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.650
But the one they've given you is 007 Is there anything you can think of immediately that

29
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.900
would lead you to remember that number?

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.170
Quite possibly the most people would instantly associate double.

31
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.500
07 With James Bond on you need to do now is remember,

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.950
toe tag an extra zero at the front and you've got it.

33
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.040
And you've probably got it for life now.

34
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.340
Why?

35
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.580
If you open the envelope and your number is 32 32?

36
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.390
Well,

37
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.710
that may be more difficult for a lot of people,

38
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.040
but probably not.

39
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.100
If you live at number 32 then it's just a case of knowing your house number,

40
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.420
which you already do,

41
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.580
and then typing it in twice.

42
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.130
Now,

43
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.150
Back in the eighties,

44
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.830
a friend of mine asked me to get some money out of the A T.

45
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.650
M for him.

46
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.360
He gave me his card,

47
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.160
he told me,

48
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.750
his pen very trusting.

49
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.680
It was over 30 years ago,

50
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:17.470
but I still know what that number waas 3618 e even told me how he remembered it on when he

51
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.580
told me that it was impossible for me to forget.

52
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.220
So just by looking at that number is that anything you notice that would make it memorable

53
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.850
to you.

54
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.980
If it doesn't jump out at you immediately,

55
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.550
try space and the numbers out differently.

56
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.250
How about three on six and 18?

57
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.500
It's simple when you see it.

58
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.330
Three multiplied by six equals 18.

59
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.450
As it turns out,

60
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.340
my body lived at number three,

61
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.800
so I had the first digit instantly.

62
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.390
He was also one of six Children on.

63
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.210
The rest was just math.

64
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.960
Now,

65
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.240
if you look for a connection,

66
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.780
you can sometimes find one,

67
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780
even if it's a tenuous one.

68
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.470
If you can't find one,

69
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.130
you can make one.

70
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.930
So you may be wondering by now what the secrets of developing a perfect memory is.

71
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.110
Well,

72
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.740
here it is.

73
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.970
Association,

74
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.350
location,

75
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.790
imagination.

76
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.940
It's even easier to memorize them.

77
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.530
Using the acronym Ali Mohammed Ali was the greatest,

78
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.160
and your memory will be great when you apply them,

79
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.640
and there is 1/4 practice.

80
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.370
But that would give us Al IP,

81
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.090
which,

82
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.010
although it's funnier,

83
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.450
is not quite so memorable.

84
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.770
Oh,

85
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.140
maybe will remember it because it's funny anyway,

86
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.890
in the next lecture will take a look at the first key to a perfect memory association.

87
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.450
I'll see you in the next lecture.
