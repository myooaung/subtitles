00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
Okay,

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.810
guys.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.620
And welcome back French.

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.100
Okay,

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.050
so French is of romance language.

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.530
That doesn't mean it's romantic,

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.090
though it does sound beautiful.

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.870
Mark Pootie,

9
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.700
Siri at my little mess.

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.320
Even that sounds great in French.

11
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.950
It means it's derived from the language spoken by the Romans.

12
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.870
Now that's a very interesting thing to know.

13
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.170
And I'll tell you why.

14
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.560
Quite a few European languages are considered romance languages.

15
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.750
And that's interesting because once you learn one,

16
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.390
you'll find that you accidentally acquired quite a bit of another,

17
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.540
even if it means a slight change in pronunciation.

18
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.950
Now you'll see that as we go through,

19
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.770
what's even more useful,

20
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.090
at least for English speakers is that an awful lot of English is derived from the romance

21
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.700
languages,

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.200
too,

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.540
which can make somewheres easy to remember naturally.

24
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.090
Okay,

25
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:11.060
so let's do this knife cu toe folk for shit.

26
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:20.540

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.050

Kettle bull you are did you mange to create some weird on wonderful scenes out of those as

33
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.160
always,

34
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.350
if you struggled with any,

35
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.100
review your scene and see if there's anything you can make stronger using your knees knees

36
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.100
.

37
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.430

38
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.120

39
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.050
but it works.

40
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.780
Fork for shed.

41
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.310
I have four sheds made of folks.

42
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.740
Spoon could.

43
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.250
Yeah,

44
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.610
getting a cool ear.

45
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.750
Cool year out of a freezer with a spoon.

46
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.380
A little strange,

47
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.990
but it works.

48
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.990
Plate us yet throwing.

49
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.290
Place it assets,

Bowl bowl.

53
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.640
I have a bowl filled with little Eiffel Towers Now,

54
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.330
because the word is very similar.

55
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.900
I just associate something French with the word French being Eiffel Towers to me.

56
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.000
Okay,

57
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.460

71
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.410
We're going to do exactly the same words.

72
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.840
Just be sure that you store them in a completely different location.

73
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.690
Something Italian.

74
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.240
