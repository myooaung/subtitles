1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Okay,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,840
guys.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,100
And welcome back.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,460
Meet some of my friends or the rogue's gallery.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,720
Now,

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,760
when you're Lincoln and name two face,

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,150
be sure to use something permanent about the person.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,910
When I say permanence,

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,970
I mean their personal features.

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,660
Remember,

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,020
Close could change or frequently will ask her their style of dress.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,870
Even something like hair color could change all.

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,550
Be less frequently whenever possible.

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,850
Go for the things that won't change.

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,510
If they happen to look like Tom Cruise,

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,330
use that.

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,470
Chances are that if they instantly remind you of Tom Cruise the first time you meet,

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,380
they probably will the next time,

19
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,800
too.

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,970
If they have extraordinarily large years used that.

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,520
Just remember to never tell them that that's the first thing you noticed about them.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,620
Okay,

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,240

00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,570

26
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,670

28
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,520

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,690

If there were any of those that you struggled with,

78
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,950
just go back over the lecture and think about the connections you made.

79
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,710

80
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,090

81
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,420

The more you apply these techniques,

84
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,550
the faster and stronger your associations and your memory will be.

85
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,950
If your job brings you into contact with lots of new people,

86
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,750
that's a great chance to give your new skills a test run.

87
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,040
Maybe meet a lot of people socially.

88
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,770
If you don't,

89
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,190
