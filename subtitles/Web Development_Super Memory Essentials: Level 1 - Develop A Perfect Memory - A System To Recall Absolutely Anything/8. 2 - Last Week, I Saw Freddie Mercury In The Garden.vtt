00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Okay,

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.260
guys on Welcome back last week.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.740
Isil,

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.650
Freddie Mercury in the garden.

5
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.970
So how did you do on the test?

6
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.760
Don't worry if you didn't get them all right,

7
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.850
the first time around,

8
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.950
there's no pressure here on we've only just started.

9
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.430
Of course,

10
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.600
if you did a sit,

11
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.150
well done.

12
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.200
You Now,

13
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.480
in the last lecture we learned about association on by applying our imagination a little,

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.600
we could make a connection between two things that ordinarily just wouldn't go together.

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.770
Though it may not be obvious at the moment what you actually achieve.

16
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.820
There was so much more than that.

17
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.040
You just created three mini movies.

18
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.770
Movies Tell a story in just a minute.

19
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm going to tell you a story.

20
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.820
But first,

21
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.450
I want to give you some made up statistics.

22
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.490
The planets I once read that one in 10 people think they know how many planets there are in

23
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.750
our solar system.

24
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.600
One in 100.

25
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.430
No.

26
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.290
They know how many planets there are.

27
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.450
One in 1000.

28
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.400
Kaname them on.

29
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.550
Only one in 10,000 can name them in order.

30
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.120
Now,

31
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.000
those numbers are far too need to be inaccurate statistic,

32
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.710
but scale wise they're probably not that far off.

33
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.740
So which are you?

34
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.850
Do you think you know how many planets there are?

35
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.030
Do you know You know how many planets there are?

36
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.670
Can you name them all?

37
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.850
Can you name them all in order?

38
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.500
Well,

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.980
if you know one in 10,000 already,

40
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.310
you are about to bay.

41
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.680
So I said I was gonna tell you a story.

42
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.050
Are you sitting comfortably?

43
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.730
Just kill it.

44
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.860
So for the next minute also,

45
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560
I want you to get comfortable,

46
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.400
take a few deep breaths and let them out.

47
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.150
Slowly.

48
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.500
Relax.

49
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.350
Close your eyes and live the events of this story with me as it unfolds.

50
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.870
See what I see here When I hear and feel what I feel.

51
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.610
Okay,

52
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.100
ready?

53
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.050
Then I'll begin.

54
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.880
Last week I was looking out of a window into a nearby garden,

55
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.030
just minding my own business when I thought I saw someone famous.

56
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.270
This could be exciting.

57
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.760
I could tell my friends I look closer and I could clearly see the moustache and the teeth.

58
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.540
Imagine my shock when I realized it Waas.

59
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.450
In fact,

60
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.260
none other than the amazing Freddie Mercury lead singer of the legendary rock band queen.

61
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.560
He was much smaller than I imagined.

62
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.740
Tiny in fact,

63
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.260
maybe only 18 inches,

64
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.320
45 centimeters in height.

65
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.960
It looked like he was trying to get that silver liquid metal back into a thermometer,

66
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.870
but it kept slipping through his fingers.

67
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.500
He was going everywhere,

68
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.460
even had some in his moustache.

69
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.670
Campell Freddie,

70
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.810
I shout it not stuffs poisonous.

71
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.590
And as he started to look up towards May,

72
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.280
he was distracted by a loud banging noise coming from a wooden gate at the far end of the

73
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.880
garden.

74
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.490
So we brushed himself down,

75
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.740
and he made his way to the gate and opened it standing.

76
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.300
There was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen,

77
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.640
a true goddess of love,

78
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.680
Venus,

79
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.760
if there ever was one she had with her an ancient Greek statue of an equally beautiful

80
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.130
woman.

81
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.550
But the arms were missing.

82
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.550
That looks familiar,

83
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.110
I thought.

84
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.550
But what an old scene.

85
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.310
Together.

86
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.260
They bought the statue into the center of the garden and tried to stand it up,

87
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.490
but it kept tipping over one way.

88
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.220
Then the other,

89
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.460
as the plant it stood on,

90
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.250
was broken.

91
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.290
They both scratched their heads for a while,

92
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.850
had a bit of a discussion on then they clearly had an idea.

93
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.090
They lay the statue down carefully,

94
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.650
got on their hands and knees and started scraping away at the earth with their bare hands.

95
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.280
They were clearly going to make a hole to stand is up in now faster and faster.

96
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.420
They dug earth was flying everywhere all over their faces,

97
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.080
their clothes,

98
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.790
the statue.

99
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.350
Some even went over the fence into the neighbouring garden.

100
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.980
I bet that was making a mess.

101
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.660
The neighbor would not be happy.

102
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.680
Then they suddenly stopped.

103
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.450
It looked like they had found something unexpected.

104
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.720
I couldn't see what itwas from where I waas but it looked like candy Little bars in black

105
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.790
rappers with red writing What's strange?

106
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.690
Who bury candy had to be sure So I opened the window and shared it.

107
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.220
Hey,

108
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.860
what have you found down there?

109
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.260
It looks like candy,

110
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.320
They shouted back in unison.

111
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.190
It is!

112
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.500
We found a stash of Mars past.

113
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.850
There are hundreds off the muju.

114
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.230
They were making such a racket.

115
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.220
So much so that the man from the neighboring garden Yes,

116
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.890
that garden burst through the fence.

117
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.000
He was a giant of a man at least 500 feet tall,

118
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.280
stretching up as far as the sky.

119
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.360
Now I thought he would be mad,

120
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.030
what with all the noise and the mess.

121
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.630
But it was really cheerful and friendly.

122
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.040
I might even go so far as to say he was jovial,

123
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.340
which I thought was quite surprising in the circumstances,

124
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.790
you could say he had a sunny disposition.

125
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.040
Perhaps that's why you had the initials s U N in big,

126
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.860
shimmering gold letters printed across the front of his T shirt.

127
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.090
What a basanti that waas.

128
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.080
OK,

129
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.260
open your eyes.

130
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.810
Now I'm sure about a minute into that story,

131
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.070
you realize exactly what it waas.

132
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.060
That story gives you the precise order of all the planets from the sun outwards.

133
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.730
If we wish through the story,

134
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.140
we can count them off.

135
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.980
So who was the first person that we met?

136
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.210
It was Freddie Mercury and Mercury is our first planet.

137
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.100
He was even playing with that silver liquid from a thermometer,

138
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.360
which,

139
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.830
of course,

140
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.000
is also mercury.

141
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.450
Just to reinforce the point,

142
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.890
he was also tiny,

143
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.590
as mercury is the smallest planet.

144
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.840
Next he meant that beautiful woman who was banging on the gate.

145
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.880
That goddess Venus on Venus is our second planet.

146
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.880
Now she was carrying the Venus de Milos,

147
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.840
just to be sure from there.

148
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.050
Can you recall what happened next?

149
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.970
Well,

150
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.130
they got on their hands and knees and started digging a hole,

151
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.740
and Earth was going everywhere.

152
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.230
So our third planet is earth on.

153
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.060
What was it they found when they started digging?

154
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.360
That's right.

155
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.800
A huge stash of delicious Mars bars on Mars is our fourth planet.

156
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.400
And after that,

157
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.250
what happened?

158
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.050
Well,

159
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.680
they're making such a racket in their celebrations that they made that giant jovial man

160
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.290
from next.

161
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.770
All burst through the fence.

162
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.750
Jove,

163
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.060
Bean,

164
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.790
the other name for Jupiter,

165
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.900
the God of the sky on the biggest giant planets.

166
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.310
So Planet five is Jupiter.

167
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.280
Finally,

168
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.980
can you recall what the big,

169
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.250
shimmering gold initials were on his T shirt?

170
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.000
S u N they stand for satin,

171
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.010
Uranus and Neptune also giants on their 6th 7th and eighth planets.

172
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.040
Okay,

173
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.490
so take a minute.

174
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.860
Also,

175
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.880
to pause the lecture on run through that story again in your head.

176
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.550
Really?

177
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.490
Of all the detail,

178
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.040
the sights,

179
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.570
the sounds,

180
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.600
the emotions and when you already hit play okay?

181
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.800
welcome back.

182
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.510
So how many planets are there?

183
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.440
Can,

184
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.190
you know,

185
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.650
Name them in order Which planet is the biggest?

186
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.050
Which is the smallest Which planet comes before Neptune?

187
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.180
So that's a pretty well known story for memorizing the planet.

188
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.570
But can you see how willing to each item or plan it to the next in sequence other than

189
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.560
being planets and diet is there is no connection between Mercury and Venus.

190
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.950
But by spinning a story around them or a mini movie,

191
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.150
just like he did in the last lecture,

192
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.820
we forge the link we were unlikely to forget on.

193
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.000
Then we got from Venus to earth,

194
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.220
from Earth to Mars,

195
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.130
master Jupiter on finally satin,

196
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.560
Uranus and Neptune.

197
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.260
So congratulations.

198
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.960
You are now one of the few people who can confidently name all the planets.

199
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.730
Now,

200
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.550
in case you're shouting at the screen,

201
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.740
what about Pluto's?

202
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.370
Well,

203
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.010
Pluto's is now officially a dwarf planet,

204
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.470
according to NASA.

205
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.690
But if you did want to know where it sets,

206
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.250
it's right at the end.

207
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:30.640
So there's another perhaps simpler way of remembering the order Mum visits every Monday,

208
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.710
just stays until noon.

209
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.540
Now,

210
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.300
the first letter of each word gives you the first letter of each of the planets.

211
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.210
It's quick,

212
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.030
but personally,

213
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.650
I prefer this story as there are two planets that became with the letter M.

214
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.430
Okay.

215
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.960
Next,

216
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.400
we're gonna put that storytelling ability into action.

217
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.450
I'll see you in the next lecture.
