00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
Okay,

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.080
guys.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.900
And welcome back.

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.890
Easy as pie.

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.690
Now pies that infinite number that goes on and on and ob to infinity.

6
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.140
It's often used to test to see how good your memory is.

7
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.540
No,

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.420
most people can goes far as 3.14 but we're going to go to 12 decimal places.

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.250
So here's what that looks like.

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.980
Three point 141592653589 Are you ready?

11
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.310
Okay,

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.830
as we have three pairs of two digits,

13
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.330
will need three scenes in your journey.

14
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.150
You may want a handcuff three yourself to a pie at this start of it.

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.750
So seen 1 14 a.

16
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.140
D.

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.630
Allen Davis of Jonathan Creek Fame.

18
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.800
15

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.620
A E.

20
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.280
Albert Einstein writing on a blackboard So Alan Davis,

21
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.030
writing on a blackboard,

22
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.760
gives us 1415 Next scene,

23
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.300
too.

24
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:17.150
92 equals and be Norman Bates of Psycho Fame and 65 Sam Elliott wearing a cowboy Stetson So

25
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.220
Norman Bates,

26
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.680
wearing a cowboy Stetson,

27
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.410
gives us 9 to 65 Seen 3 35 c.

28
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.900
E.

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.850
Clint Eastwood on 89 h.

30
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.500
En Horatio Nelson Looking through a telescope So Clint Eastwood,

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.280
looking through a telescope is 35 89.

32
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.230
So putting all that together,

33
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.750
we have Allen Davis writing on a blackboard,

34
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.320
Norman Bates wearing a Stetson and Clint Eastwood looking through a telescope.

35
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:57.500
141592653589 And that's the 1st 12 digits off pie.

36
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.600
Okay,

37
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.110
you can,

38
00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.680
of course,

39
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.790
use the major system if you find that easier.

40
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.570
But either way,

41
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.670
you need never be put off by memorizing lung numbers again.

42
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.130
It's as easy as pie.

43
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
