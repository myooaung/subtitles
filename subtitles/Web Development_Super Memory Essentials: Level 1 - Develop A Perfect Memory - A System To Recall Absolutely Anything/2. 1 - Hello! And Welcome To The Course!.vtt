00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.260
Hello on Dwell Comm to the course.

2
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.720
I am so happy to have you here.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.660
We have searched a lot in store.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.890
It's difficult to know where to begin,

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.370
so I guess we'll start at the beginning.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.580
I am Alan and I used to have a normal memory.

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.140
That is,

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.280
I could learn stuff,

9
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.920
but only at a certain pace.

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.650
If I tried to cram too much,

11
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.210
I just forget what I had already learned.

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.500
No,

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.800
great.

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.280
When you have a tough exam to take that you've already failed twice.

15
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.020
It's crazy knowing what I know now that what I learned on what you two will learn over the

16
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.140
next few hours isn't taught in infant school.

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.450
If it waas,

18
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.620
we would be a world of super high achievers.

19
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.290
Anyway,

20
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.280
I have a lot of stuff in store for you,

21
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.150
and it's going to be easier than you ever thought possible.

22
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.350
We're even gonna have fun along the way.

23
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.830
What I will give you in this course of secrets to developing a perfect memory.

24
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.120
If you want to give it a fancy name,

25
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.590
we call them no Monix After the Greek goddess of memory nem assign Now,

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.930
by the end of this course,

27
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.960
you will have memorized your 1st 10 words in four different foreign languages.

28
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.610
Three US state capitals,

29
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.190
European capitals,

30
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.860
the major gods of Greek and Roman mythology.

31
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.360
Names and faces.

32
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.350
Hang on.

33
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.190
We're not done yet.

34
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.240
Numbers and dates the planets in orders in in order,

35
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.730
wedding anniversaries,

36
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.510
birthdays,

37
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.600
the 10 Commandments.

38
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.020
A bunch of collective now owns the names of phobias.

39
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.820
All of this without breaking a sweat.

40
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.040
Difficult to believe,

41
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.560
right?

42
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.540
I thought so,

43
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.950
too.

44
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.280
But before we start,

45
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.660
we need to establish your baseline where you are now.

46
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.580
And to do that,

47
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.000
I need you to take two tests.

48
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.110
One is a list,

49
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.750
and one is a sequence of numbers.

50
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.530
Now,

51
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.990
I'll give you about a minute for each list,

52
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.200
and I want you to concentrate on remembering as many of them as you can.

53
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.540
Score yourself a point for each one.

54
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.780
And if you get them all in order,

55
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.550
score a bonus 10 points for each round.

56
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.730
And keep a note of your scores as this is where you started.

57
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.450
Okay.

58
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.850
Test one.

59
00:02:15.850 --> 00:03:18.540
Okay.

60
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.680
Now write them down somewhere and then go back a little in the lecture.

61
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.790
Mark yourself.

62
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.640
Remember one point for every correct answer on a bonus.

63
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.040
10 points if you got them all in order when you don't come back and we'll do the number

64
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.660
test.

65
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.110
Okay?

66
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.690
Right.

67
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.120
That score damage somewhere for safe keeping.

68
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.550
Now,

69
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.700
let's do the number test.

70
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.670
I will show you a 10 digit number for about a minute,

71
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.350
and they want you to memorize as much of it as you can.

72
00:03:46.350 --> 00:04:49.640
Ready Hagos again.

73
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.170
Write them down somewhere and then go back a little in this lecture on dmarc yourself.

74
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.940
Remember one point for every correct answer and a bonus 10 points.

75
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.020
If you got them all in order.

76
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.580
When you're done right,

77
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.980
then your score and keep it somewhere safe.

78
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.410
There will be a test at the end,

79
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.230
Okay.

80
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.050
How did you do?

81
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.710
100% plus both bonuses.

82
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.410
If so,

83
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.670
you don't need this course.

84
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.710
If not,

85
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.400
prepare to be amazed of what you can do.

86
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.470
By the end of this course again,

87
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.150
I'm really happy to have you here and I'll see you in the next lecture.
