00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Okay,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.300
guys.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.240
And welcome back memorizing dates with the major system now.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.880
Usually you don't have to memorize birthdays and anniversaries on the spot,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.820
so this is a really useful tool for that.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.150
Let's take a look.

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.290
Okay,

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.550
so here we are,

9
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.030
back in the major system database.

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.370
So let's have a play around this numerical sequence for words at my best friend from

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.030
childhood,

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.410
in fact,

13
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.940
that some let's yeah,

14
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.470
let's let's have a go with the numbers My best friend from your childhood,

15
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.850
Lloyd.

16
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.340
His birthday's on 27th of January.

17
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.180
So I put in a one.

18
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.930
Which words would we get using the major system where we can see here that we've got a boat

19
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.510
load to choose from?

20
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060
Ideally,

21
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.750
what I'm looking for is a name.

22
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.510
They go Shar day,

23
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.760
a very famous British blue singer.

24
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.490
Shar day I love so I could use Shar day for all of my January birthdays and anniversaries,

25
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.850
and he was on the 27th so one else if we got on here.

26
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.180
Nike.

27
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.610
Now,

28
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.300
my friend Lloyd is a really keen runner.

29
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.090
So if I have my friend Lloyd and I have Shar Day,

30
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.190
a Nike in the scene I will never forget the His birthday is on January chard.

31
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.650
A Nike the 27th.

32
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.670
So let's have a look Who else could get?

33
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.850
Let's set me mom.

34
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.680
My mom was born on the 22nd off December So December.

35
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.640
What can we get for December?

36
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.180
We have Donna.

37
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.850
I don't know anybody named Donna.

38
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.950
We have tiny we have tiny on my mom's Only little s o Let's set.

39
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.000
Let's stick with Tiny for December.

40
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260
This is just for my mom to say There are lots of names in here,

41
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.190
So if you can pick a name that's insulin instantly memorable for you,

42
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.850
that would be a perfect key to a month.

43
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.990
So 22nd what do we have?

44
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.700
Uh nah,

45
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.570
me time.

46
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.500
Minnelli on my nanny was indeed nanny to where?

47
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.740
To my nieces and nephew.

48
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.940
So Tiny Nanny gives me December 22nd and that's my mom's birthday.

49
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.680
In a few hours of playing with this,

50
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.030
you could memorize the birthdays and anniversaries of all of your friends and family.

51
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.770
Just get a list and away you go and you will never forget one again.

52
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.410
So next will take a look at the other super powerful system for memorizing numbers.

53
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.080
The Dominic system.

54
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.670
I'll see you in the next lecture
