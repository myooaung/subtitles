1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,270
Okay,

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:05,790
guys,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,540
And welcome back the European capitals.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,160
There's a whole wide world of countries and capitals you can practice on,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,500
but for now we'll stick with Europe again.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,550
There are quite a few,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,350
so we'll just do 10.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,750
But this time in reverse alphabetical order.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,550
Now,

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,700
at the end of the lecture,

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,300
I'll tell you how to remember them.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,570
But these are just pneumonic AIDS,

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,260
and no offense is meant to the citizens of those countries.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,750
Okay,

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,850
it's just how I remember them.

16
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,230
As always,

17
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,400
you can find a complete list is a downloadable resource,

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,990

Okay,

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,650
have you got them all?

30
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,330
If so,

31
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,280
feel free to move on to the quiz.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,750
But if you struggled with any,

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,480
here's how I remember them.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,470
Vatican CITY Vatican City I imagine entering the Vatican to find a slightly smaller Vatican

35
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,350
inside.

36
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,230
I entered that Vatican,

37
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,410
and there's an even smaller Vatican inside that one.

38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,620
You get the picture now.

39
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,500

I'm British,

42
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,900
so I don't need a demonic for this.

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,110

Bern I have a very posh bank,

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,830
which I associate with Switzerland on fire,

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,250
and anyone who goes near it gets burned.

49
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,450

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,090

57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,930
like the one in only fools and horses and Del Boy Trotter is saying,

58
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,290
