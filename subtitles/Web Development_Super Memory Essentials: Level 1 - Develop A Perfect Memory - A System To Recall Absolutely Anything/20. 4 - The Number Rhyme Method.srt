1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
Okay,

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,370
guys.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,630
And welcome back the number rime method.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,840
Both of the single digits systems we will look at have been around for a long time,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,460
and you probably may even remember that from childhood.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,810
But just because some method works nicely for Children does not mean that it can't work

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,650
equally as well for adults.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,690
In fact,

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,440
whenever I begin a study of a new subjects and I have started a lot of stuff my go to

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,110
places the Children sections in Waterstones,

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,440
which is kind of the UK equivalent of Barnes and Noble adults tend to complicate things

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,140
farm or than they should.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,440
It's a curious thing.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,260
I think the kids love land and they eat it up.

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,340
It's fun that is right up until the point where adults teach them just out.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,650
Difficult learning is,

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,820
and then the joy goes out of it.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,850
But I digress,

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,210
so the number rime system is very,

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,350
very simple.

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,290
You pick a word that rhymes with a number and substitute that simple.

22
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,790
It goes something like this.

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:16,430
Zero hero one bun to shoe three tree full Dole sighs.

24
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:35,280
Hive six sticks seven heaven eight gate Knowing wine 10 den So it's childish,

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,950
as I said,

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,000
but let's give it a try.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,850
Picture each of these scenes for about 10 seconds.

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,000
How many under par is a birdie?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,750
Engulf one?

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,660
Imagine playing golf,

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,790
but you use a bung for a ball and you hit a bird.

32
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,110
Just picture that for about 10 seconds.

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,850
Okay.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,280
How many humans went into Noah's Ark?

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
Eight.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,890
No.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,580
Imagine there is a gate eight and everyone on the Ark has to pass through it.

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,790
Just picture that scene for a few seconds.

39
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay?

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,890
Five is the atomic number of boron.

41
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,380
Now imagine a boring person sitting on a beehive.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,300
Five.

43
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,760
In tennis,

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,540
how high is the net in feet three.

45
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,930
Imagine a tennis net tied between two trees.

46
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,960
Three on Finally,

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,780
the opposite sides of a die Always add up to seven.

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,750
Imagine rolling to die at the craps table and praying to heaven for a win.

49
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,710
Okay,

50
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,610
we'll do a quick test now and I'll see you after that.
