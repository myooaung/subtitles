00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
Okay,

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.730
guys.

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.900
And welcome back the American State capitals Now.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.620
I mentioned earlier that I keep all my American state capitals in the bar from cheers.

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.720
So unless you have an overwhelming desire to memorize these in a specific order,

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.870
there's no need to use a journey.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.410
You may want to read the group them all together in one locations.

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.820
I did,

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.190
or you could just link off the name and have them anywhere.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.400
It's entirely up to you.

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.520
I'm mindful that there are 50 to memorize here,

12
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.430
so I don't want to give you a lecture that is two hours long,

13
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.210
so we'll just concentrate on the 1st 10 A full list is available as a downloadable resource

14
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.750
so you can pick up the other 40 at your leisure.

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.680
Now again,

16
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.410
we're going to use our knees and create a link from one thing to another.

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.080
Simple,

18
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.680
possibly the easiest to commit to memories.

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.040
The state of Mississippi.

20
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.660
Whose capital is Jackson?

21
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.270
Okay,

22
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.280
we're going to do 11 and not 10.

23
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.220
Now.

24
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm sure you can come up with an image for the Mississippi,

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.170
perhaps the river or one of those old steamboats.

26
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.770
Personally,

27
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.460
I use the river and Jackson.

28
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.220
Who else?

29
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.000
Other than the king of pop himself,

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.060
Michael Jackson?

31
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.070
I just have Michael Jackson moonwalking across the Mississippi.

32
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.950
This is all so cheesy stuff when you know how.

33
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.350
Right?

34
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.520
