1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Okay,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:04,690
guys.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,620
And welcome back the story method we learned in the last lecture held by forming a

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,390
connection.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,470
An association between items we want to remember.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,650
We have a really neat way of committing seemingly unconnected things together.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,120
Not only did we go from Item 1 to 2,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,550
Mercury to Venus,

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,960
but then 2 to 3.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,230
Venus to Earth,

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,260
3 to 4,

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,270
earth to Mars.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,620
And so one until we got an entire memorable scene that we can instantly play back in our

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,510
heads forwards backwards and in any order.

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,030
Cool,

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,550
Right.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,120
Well,

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,750
this time it's your 10.

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,370
Now,

20
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,380
what I'd like it to do it's not compulsory is to post your story to the Q and a section of

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,090
the cause.

22
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,630
So we can all see how creative you bean Nothing rude or offensive.

23
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,020
Please.

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,550
As I say,

25
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,960
it's entirely optional.

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,760
Okay,

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,150
as start point,

28
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,530
I want you to imagine a wedding scene of some sort.

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,860
Maybe here Mendelssohn's wedding march playing in the background,

30
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm going to give them to you want us?

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,860
It's home with five or six seconds in between each.

32
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,300
If you need a little longer,

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,270
just hit pause until you've made that connection and then come back.

34
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,240
Remember,

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,950
your first thought is often the best.

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,590
Ready.

37
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,250
Hagos paper.

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:33,750
Cotton,

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:50,850
Lead them limn.

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:02:15,320
Would I n wolf

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:24,160
Bruns.

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:40,380
Pottery Tin.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,530
Okay,

44
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,920
let's see how you did.

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,350
Close your eyes.

46
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,310
Can you see that welling seen here?

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,020
The music.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,870
Okay,

49
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,430
good.

50
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,150
Then what was the first item?

51
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,650
It was paper and then a second item.

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,350
Cotton.

53
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,430
I said leather number.

54
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:20,240
Full linen number five would sinks.

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:29,340
I n seven was wolf eight with bronze.

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:37,180
Nine pottery on 10 was 10.

57
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Did you get them all?

59
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
If you did well done.

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,350
That is amazing.

61
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:42,890
If not,

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,810
that's fine too.

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,250
As we still have more techniques to come,

64
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,230
they can you guess what?

65
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,850
That sequence Waas.

66
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,760
It's the 1st 10 wedding anniversaries.

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
Now I must point out that this is the US version.

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,030
The UK version is slightly different,

69
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,610
but both through available to download from this lecture along with all the subsequent

70
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,150
anniversaries if you fancy the challenge.

71
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,700
So here's my story for recall in them.

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,950
I imagine I am outside a church in the wedding march is being played and that sets the

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,070
scene for me And the entire church is made of papier mache A,

74
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,080
which is paper,

75
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,670
and that's unusual.

76
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,160
Now the bride and groom appear at the church door.

77
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,020
Notice the order,

78
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,810
their bride and groom.

79
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,670
The bride is duct cotton from EastEnders and that gives me cotton.

80
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,190
On her groom is a big cartoon cow,

81
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,410
which gives me leather.

82
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,900
They walked down the past to a pile of wedding presents,

83
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,920
which they then proceed to open,

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,630
and everyone is bought than the same thing.

85
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,840
Bed linen,

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,200
linen So everything doesn't make a mess.

87
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,740
A little help is dragging each one away as they open it.

88
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,320
That's Woody Woodpecker would.

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,980
But what's he doing with them?

90
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,580
Well,

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,950
because they're all creased from the pathogen is ironing them so that crisp and neat and

92
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,360
that gives me iron as he completes,

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,030
Each one is stacking them on the backs of sheep,

94
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,250
and that gives me wolf.

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,790
Eventually,

96
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,550
there's a herd of sheep balancing piles of betting on their backs,

97
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,920
and they all end off in the same direction.

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,890
But they keep bumping into things.

99
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,410
I looked to see why,

100
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,310
and I can see that sun is glinting off something in the distance,

101
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,410
and it's blinding them.

102
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,160
The poor things I get close to the object,

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,370
and I can see it's a huge bronze statue of Cupid Bruns.

104
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,160
Now they are so in love and Cuba.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,010
This firing is Arrow Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze E.

106
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,800
Who were recreating that scene from Ghost,

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,320
the one where he sits behind her at the potter's wheel.

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,960
Pottery.

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,170
Now the trouble is,

110
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,150
the wheel is making such a squeaking noise is going to ruin the entire day.

111
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,970
Luckily,

112
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,120
help is on hand,

113
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,750
and the Tin Man from the Wizard of us 10 comes to the rescue and oils the wheel,

114
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,680
and everyone lived happily ever after.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,120
And don't all the best stories having that way?

116
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,970
Okay,

117
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,960
Before we move on,

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,050
let's take another short test and I'll see you after that.
