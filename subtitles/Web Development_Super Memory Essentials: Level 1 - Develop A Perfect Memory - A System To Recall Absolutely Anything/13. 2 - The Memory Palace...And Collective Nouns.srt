1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Okay,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,520
guys.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,960
And welcome back the memory palace and collections I mentioned in the lecture on location

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,470
that locations a great for preserving the sequence of things as we just did with the 10

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,250
Commandments.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,860
But I also said that location could be useful for grouping things together.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,450
And that's what we're going to do now.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:30,600
One of the first things I ever memorized just for fun with the American State capitals.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:30,980
No,

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,540
I've never bean to America,

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,000
which would be the logical choice of store in this kind of information.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,850
But what I do know really well is cheers.

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,200
I never missed an episode of that American sitcom that ran from the 19 eighties to the

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,000
nineties.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,850
I know every detail of the bar where Norm sits,

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,660
where cliffs.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,080
It's sums office,

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,210
the pool room.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,050
When the Indian statue is.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,290
I had no need to recall them in order,

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,950
but it seemed like a natural place to solve them,

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,430
as that was the most American thing I was familiar with at that time,

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,050
a good place for my collection.

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,630
When I started to memorize foreign vocabulary,

25
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,160
I store all of my French,

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,280
weighs in and around my school.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,030
I hadn't been to France,

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,980
but I did learn French in school,

29
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,430
so that's where they live.

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,920
When I did Italian,

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,450
I stole them in and around Florence.

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,100
I visited there many times.

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,960
They have lots of places that I can hook things onto.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,100
Spanish vocabulary is stored in and around Barcelona.

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,850
Another place I know really well.

36
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,680
To recall anything I've memorized,

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,560
I just close my eyes and instantly visit any of the places in my memory palace.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,160
Now we've already started filling yours.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,370
You've lent the planet's andan order,

40
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,060
I might add.

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,420
We've memorized the first time wedding anniversaries on.

42
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,640
We've even mastered the 10 Commandments.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,140
Imagine if you entered a pope quiz and all the questions were on those subjects you would

44
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,550
win.

45
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,350
So let's add to your memory palace again Right now.

46
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,670
I mentioned collections at South of this lecture.

47
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,250
So let's memorize a bunch of collective now owns.

48
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,370
Choose a place that's right,

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,120
view where you can instantly go back to to retrieve them.

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,320
We're going to do 10 of my favorites here,

51
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,990
but there is a huge list is a damn illegible resource from this lecture.

52
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,150
If you really want to test yourself,

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,070
I'm gonna give you about five or six seconds between each one.

54
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,840
Ready?

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:36,050
Hagos Bears sleuth.

56
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,010
So a group of bass is called a sleuth of bands.

57
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:54,320
Buoys a blush of boys,

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:01,480
girls,

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,290
a giggle of girls,

60
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:18,210
head jogs and porcupines,

61
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:33,870
a critical lizards,

62
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:42,910
a lounge.

63
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:51,150
Owls,

64
00:03:51,150 --> 00:04:00,050
a parliament of owls,

65
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:07,700
wizards.

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:16,040
An argument of Wizards.

67
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:24,220
Rhine Nursery,

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:40,660
a crash of rhinoceros skunks,

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:49,100
a stench of skunks,

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,420
tigers,

71
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:04,500
an ambush of tigers.

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,510
Okay,

73
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,420
did you get them all?

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,720
I'll just recap them now so that you can see how you did.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,340
Okay,

76
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,290
so the 1st 1 was bass,

77
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,100
and it's a sleuth of bears.

78
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,950
Next we had boys,

79
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,590
and that was a blush of boys.

80
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,850
Next we had girls,

81
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:39,270
and it's a giggle of girls on next,

82
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,320
we had hedgehogs and porky pines.

83
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,190
Both had the same collective now,

84
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,180
and that is a prigel of hair junks or porcupines.

85
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,270
Next we have lizards,

86
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,270
and that was a lounge of lizards.

87
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,430
Next came owls,

88
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,550
and there was a parliament of owls.

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,340
After that,

90
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,680
we had wizards,

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,570
and it's an argument of wizards.

92
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,300
Then came rhinoceros or rhinos,

93
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,550
and that's a crash of rhinos.

94
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,000
Next came skunks,

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:35,020
and there are a stench of skunks and finally we did tigers on.

96
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,980
There is an ambush of tigers.

97
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,670
Okay,

98
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,840
just for completeness.

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,210
Here's my associations.

100
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,570
For those bears,

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,420
I imagine a bunch of grizzly bears with magnifying glasses,

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,710
just like the famous sleuth Sherlock Holmes.

103
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,230
And for Boys.

104
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,770
I imagine a group of boys all blushing as the girls walked by.

105
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,680
So we have a blush of boys girls.

106
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,790
I imagine the girls giggling at the boys as their blushing hedgehogs and porcupines.

107
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,220
I imagine a bunch of hedgehogs with little cocktail Indian skewered on their spiky spines.

108
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,710
This gives me pickle,

109
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,230
which rhymes with prickles,

110
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,850
which is a natural collective known for her jugs and bulky pines.

111
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,710
Okay,

112
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,990
lizards on this one won't apply to everyone,

113
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,680
but it's simple.

114
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,740
For May I just hear the crowded have sung weather with you on the lyrics?

115
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,040
Or do I lie like a lounge room lizard on?

116
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,800
Until I actually looked up?

117
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,670
What the collective name for listens Waas.

118
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,370
I didn't know that it wasa lounge,

119
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,800
so they go do I lie like a lounge room lizard.

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
Els.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,920
I imagine a mini parliament,

122
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,460
and all the politicians are owls for wizards.

123
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,780
I have Harry Potter and Merlin in an argument casting spells to each other for rhinos.

124
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,550
I imagine a rhino crashing into the side of a car in a safari park,

125
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,690
which almost happened to me years ago.

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,270
At the skunks,

127
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,070
I imagine a fell smell coming from a line of skunks,

128
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,810
all sitting on a bench,

129
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,510
which rhymes with stench.

130
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,620
And we have a stench,

131
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,690
skunks and tigers here.

132
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:21,240
I imagine a group of tigers dressed as red Indian warriors waiting to ambush the Cowboys

133
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,410
coming through the past.

134
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,730
Okay,

135
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,390
I'll see you in the next lecture.
