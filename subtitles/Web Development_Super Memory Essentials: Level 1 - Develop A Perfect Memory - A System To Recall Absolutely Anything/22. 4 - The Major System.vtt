00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
Okay,

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.120
guys on.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.120
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.770
The major system.

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.390
Okay,

6
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.900
now we come to the good stuff.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.760
I will show you the two most effective systems from memorizing long numbers.

8
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.620
One is perfect for memorizing numbers on the fly.

9
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.950
If you're out and about and the other is perfect.

10
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.650
If you have a little more time to build your pneumonic scene will do that one first.

11
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.330
The major system was developed by Stanley Slice Mink on Wednesday.

12
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120
I'm in the 17th century,

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.550
so he's been around for a while.

14
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.020
The major system is based on quite a simple premise.

15
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.980
If you can convert numbers to letters and then convert those letters toe words,

16
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.730
they're easier to recall.

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.890
A toll drew simple.

18
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.640
Now each of the numbers from zero through nine have a specific letter or,

19
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.540
more accurately,

20
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.150
a frenetic sound associated with them.

21
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.090
And after that,

22
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.740
you just used the veils or the letters W,

23
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.230
h,

24
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.850
y or X to fill in the blanks.

25
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.450
You'll be glad to know that there is a built in way to memorize which numbers correspond to

26
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.590
which letters and sounds which,

27
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.240
if you read through it a couple of times,

28
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.160
you can memorize in about 10 minutes.

29
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.900
And trust me,

30
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.150
it's 10 minutes well spent.

31
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
Now you can get this table is downloadable resource in this lecture.

32
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.610
But the full table looks like this so you can see down the side.

33
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.660
We have the number zero through nine,

34
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.300
and each of them has a constant sound.

35
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.320
So zero is s Zedd or a soft C.

36
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.760
So examples would be sue zoo an ace notice that we're filling in with vowels on the way to

37
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.920
remember that is that zero starts with said and so on and so forth all the way down till we

38
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.100
get to nine,

39
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.030
which is P or B,

40
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.240
which could be the words ape or be on DPI and nine.

41
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.790
Both have a loop and a tail.

42
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.440
Let's take a couple of simple worked examples.

43
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.540
Let's say we wanted to remember that satin has 62 confirmed moons would take the letter

44
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.230
sound for six the letter sound for two and see if we could make a word.

45
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:17.250
But six equals J C H S H or soft G and two equals n.

46
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.270
So we could say h six and no for two.

47
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.020
That would give us Shin.

48
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.520
But by dropping a vowel or two in there,

49
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.000
we could create the word.

50
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.460
Shine Valley is a word that we could easily use in a demonic seem to remember that satin

51
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.220
has 62 moons not shine on it can see how that works.

52
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.270
So let's look at another Imagine.

53
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.860
You need to memorize the atomic number of plutonium 94 that would give us nine,

54
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.900
which would be a B or A P and four,

55
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.400
which is our now.

56
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.200
That would give us quite a few options.

57
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.990
We could a bear pair beer.

58
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.650
Pia,

59
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.800
Let's go with BIA,

60
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.950
you can probably make a picture of plutonium,

61
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.270
right?

62
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.340
Me.

63
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.520
I would use the Disney dog Pluto's,

64
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.930
and you may associate plutonium with atomic bonds.

65
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.330
So is there any scene that you could imagine using your knees that would involve a Disney

66
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.790
dog,

67
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.570
an atomic bomb on beer?

68
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.860
That's probably another great combination,

69
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.550
but I bet you wouldn't forget it.

70
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.830
So that's all well and good.

71
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.750
But what if you need to remember a three digit number?

72
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.710
Well,

73
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.090
you could continue with a major system and come up with the word that has all three letter

74
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.500
sounds,

75
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.090
but personally,

76
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.130
I find that that can get a little too demanding for my small brain if I need to do it on

77
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.630
the fly,

78
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.960
but we'll come to that later.

79
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.020
But there is an easy solution.

80
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.170
Just tag on the last digit,

81
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.420
using either the number shape or the number rime system.

82
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.550
I'll show you what I mean pending on where in the world you are.

83
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.670
This may not apply,

84
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.300
so take it as an illustration In the UK,

85
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.250
the emergency phone number is 999 In the States,

86
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.200
it's 911 But in almost 90 other countries around the world,

87
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.220
including most of the European Union,

88
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.370
the emergency phone number is 112 So you're on holiday in the beautiful Dominican Republic

89
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.370
.

90
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.840
Actually,

91
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.590
911 works there,

92
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.870
but we'll ignore that for a minute.

93
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.780
Is in the major system.

94
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.000
We would have D or T twice and an end so we could reach,

95
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.150
tighten or audition,

96
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.130
but neither extremely useful for memorizing which number to call in an emergency.

97
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.470
Right?

98
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.420
So But if we took 11 and applied the major system,

99
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.720
we could get to the word dead.

100
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.900
And if we turned on a swan,

101
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.360
the number shame for two,

102
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.590
we could probably come up with the seen much more easily.

103
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.550
But what about four digit numbers and beyond?

104
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.920
Well,

105
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.050
we just keep going.

106
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.440
Let's say we wanted to remember that the address for the White House for 1600 Pennsylvania

107
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.360
Avenue we could break that down into 16 and double zero 16 could give us D.

108
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.820
J.

109
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.550
And that's quite easy to picture.

110
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.870
And 00 could give a sissy.

111
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.540
Remember,

112
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.310
it's fanatic,

113
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.070
not based on how the world spelt or suis or Seuss or even S O.

114
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.610
S.

115
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.440
Could you imagine a deejay signal in S.

116
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.570
O.

117
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.110
S on the White House lawn?

118
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.250
Quite possibly.

119
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.070
Now I must admit that this was the very first system I learned for memorizing numbers.

120
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.320
So it remains with me firmly.

121
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.820
But when it came to use it,

122
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.340
I sometimes find it quite difficult to come up with words or released meaningful ways they

123
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.960
could utilise on the fly.

124
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.620
That said,

125
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.100
that was the latest on the world has moved on a little since then.

126
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.350
No,

127
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.360
we have the Internet.

128
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.480
If you do struggle,

129
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.380
there is an excellent website,

130
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.450
probably more than one that you can use.

131
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.350
Just type in the number and hey,

132
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.970
presto out Pop your words.

133
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.030
So this is immensely helpful.

134
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.980
If you have a little time to sit down and play with it,

135
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.810
you will need to memorize the table,

136
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.150
which you could do in five minutes,

137
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.800
to be honest,

138
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.130
but the website takes all the heavy lifting out.

139
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.480
If you don't need to memorize on the spot,

140
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.740
there's a link in the download brawl.

141
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.570
Show it to you in the next lecture.

142
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.550
I'll see you that.
