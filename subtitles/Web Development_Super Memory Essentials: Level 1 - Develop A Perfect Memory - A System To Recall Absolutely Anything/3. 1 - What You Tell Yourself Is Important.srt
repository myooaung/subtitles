1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Okay,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,210
guys,

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:04,440
um,

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,570
welcome back.

5
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,790
What you tell yourself is important,

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,570
and the chances are that you will have use this phrase before when you're trying to recall

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,130
something I can't remember.

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,850
But that's just not true.

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,670
If you google the phrase,

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,450
how much can we remember?

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,100
The number one hit is from the excellent team Scientific American Scientific american dot

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,480
com.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,240
Check them out.

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,480
It say's.

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,970
You might only have a few gigabytes of storage space similar to the space in an iPod or a

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,480
USB flash drive.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,460
Yet new wrongs combined,

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,990
so that each one helps with many memories at a time,

19
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,540
exponentially increasing the brain's memory storage capacity to something closer to around

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,620
2.5 petabytes or a 1,000,000 gigabytes.

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,880
That's quite a lot,

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,390
isn't it?

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,630
How many gigabytes do you think you would need to pass your next exam or recall your

24
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,060
mother's birthday or your pin number the American state capitals,

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,590
the capitals of every country in the world,

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,420
for that matter,

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,480
or a forum vocabulary?

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,120
Have you ever had this kind of thing happened to you?

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,240
You're out with your friends and you're talking about something.

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,750
Movies,

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,300
Let's say,

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,550
and someone say's who played the Liquid Metal Terminator in Terminator two.

33
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,510
You can immediately picture his face.

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,820
You may recall that he also replaced Fox Moulder in the last few seasons of The X Files,

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,250
and he was in that other show more recently,

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,220
Scorpion.

37
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,260
He has the gravelly voice,

38
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,100
the PS ing blue eyes.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,480
Now you may have a dozen different reference points,

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,030
but what is his name now?

41
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,500
All of those thoughts conclusively demonstrate that you know who you're talking about.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
It's in there somewhere.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
If you could just get to his name.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,330
So the night moves on and there was later you're lying in bed,

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,110
just about to drop off to sleep.

46
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,610
When you wake up with Start Eureka,

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,700
it's Robert Patrick now.

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,610
This is because once we set our minds to the task of retrieving a piece of information,

49
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,290
if it's not immediately available to us,

50
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,150
it does not stop looking.

51
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,550
Your mind naturally seeks resolution.

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,420
It wants to succeed instead of giving up our mind,

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,680
takes the process out of our active consciousness and continues working on the problem

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,340
unconsciously on when it is located.

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,350
That particular piece of information,

56
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,740
it gives our conscious mind prod and say Hey,

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,870
I found that thing You were looking for its Robert Patrick.

58
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,060
So the problem we face is not no capacity to store information.

59
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,730
That is,

60
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,340
for all intents and purposes,

61
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,660
almost limitless.

62
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,540
But in their ability to recall it when needed.

63
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,370
In this course,

64
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,960
I will teach you how to encode the things you want to remember,

65
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,650
so you can instantly recall them on demand.

66
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,430
So from this point forward,

67
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,100
I want you to change your language to something more accurate.

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,730
If you find yourself about to utter the words I can't remember,

69
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,480
swap it out immediately.

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,190
For at the moment,

71
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,750
I can't recall your memories.

72
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,240
Fine.

73
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,090
And together,

74
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,880
we're going to install a super learner recall mechanism on.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,650
We're gonna have fun along the way.

76
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,510
Okay,

77
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,350
I'll see you in the next lecture.
