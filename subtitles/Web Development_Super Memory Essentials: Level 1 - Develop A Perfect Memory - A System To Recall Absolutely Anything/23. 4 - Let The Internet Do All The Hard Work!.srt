1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Okay,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,230
guys.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,750
And welcome back.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,730
Let the Internet dual the hard work.

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,110
Okay,

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,340
now,

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,090
this is my preferred website,

8
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,970
which is perfect if you have a little time to come up with good images for your pneumonic

9
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,520
scenes.

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,290
It is a C t p colon slash last major die assist system dot info slash e and slash.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,810
Now there's a link to this in the download,

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,670
so you don't need to struggle to write that down now.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,690
So let's take a look at it now,

14
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,230
and I'll give you a quick risk through the basic things.

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,410
I'll show you something really useful.

16
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,060
So this is the website.

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,050
So in here we could we could have a number.

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,450
We can type in a number,

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,500
just say 25 hit show words and all the words that fit within the major system.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,510
25 to bean N five bean L will be displayed along the top here.

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,570
So if you're struggling to instantly come up with the word for 25 using N on D l.

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,650
These are all the words that actually fit,

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,960
so that's fairly self explanatory.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,400
So you could you could use that or let's certain let's Rodman sake say we we want to type a

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,150
word in.

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,580
If we talked Michael,

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:25,200
we could see that Michael translates to 365 so you can convert words two numbers so you can

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,420
do it the other way around.

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,290
So have a play around or that it's It's fairly intuitive,

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,960
but here's my favorite,

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,170
but this bit the numerical sequence toe words.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,130
So let's think of a big historical thing.

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,500
Okay?

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,390
DNA mapping was was invented in 1984 by Alec Jeffries,

35
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,410
just up the road from me in the University of Leicester.

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,960
So if we said 1984 in here,

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,710
the numerical sequence toe wears it was said,

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,000
split length of 21 that's gonna do is give us all the words for 19 and all the words for 84

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
So they go.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,630
We can split it any way we could split it.

42
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,210
111 Let's just show you that show words.

43
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,620
So then you could perhaps come up with sentence that would lead you back to the creation of

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,660
DNA mapping.

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,520
Let's go for two and see if we can find anything anything useful in there.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
So let's have a look.

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,140
What have we got down here.

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,920
We've got dubbed We got tab.

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,060
We must have.

50
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,080
We must have done dab.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,720
Must be any that then let's have a look dubbed the latest Dub Dub.

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,090
OK,

53
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,190
so dab they do a swab when you have when you have a DNA test,

54
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,560
so DAB is good.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,260
Is rain filling 84?

56
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,910
That could be they go viewer Dub viewer.

57
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,510
That's a fairly good pneumonic to memorize that day and a map in was created in 1984.

58
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,350
They go dub viewer.

59
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,050
Let's think of another thing.

60
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,770
Titanic.

61
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,650
Titanic sank in 1912 didn't it?

62
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,750
If he said 1912 and hit show words,

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,270
what have we got?

64
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:15,000
We got deep on the Titanic sank so that might be a good word to have their someone else do

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,300
we have Down here we have deep onda We have deep down detect where we sit down deep down so

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:36,400
they go 1912 translates in the major system to deep down on I'm sure you can find a way to

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,130
memorize that that the Titanic sank in 1912 by using the words deep down.

68
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,950
Anyway,

69
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,580
this has another particularly useful purpose and we're gonna come to that in the next,

70
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,090
like jet.

71
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,870
OK,

72
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,010
I'll see you then.
