00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Okay,

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.160
guys.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.340
Um,

4
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.300
welcome back.

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.970
Introduction to the number section.

6
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.240
Okay,

7
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.350
so now we get to the really interesting stuff.

8
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.280
I want to be clear with your front.

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.090
You will need to invest a little time.

10
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.250
Now if you're going to get the most out of this section,

11
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.160
the techniques are simply enough.

12
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.850
But you will need to do the work now and then you will have it for life,

13
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.840
but we're going to start over gently.

14
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.950
So there are several reasons that being able to memorize the number could be very useful.

15
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.210
Maybe you want to memorize your pin,

16
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.690
your national insurance number.

17
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.630
Someone's birthday.

18
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.620
Your anniversary?

19
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.970
Well,

20
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.250
the phone number of that really special guy or gal you just met as we learned earlier in

21
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.690
the course,

22
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.520
some numbers are instantly memorable.

23
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.190
Either to everyone switches double 07 or two.

24
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.210
Specifically,

25
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.290
perhaps I have some bad for our birthday.

26
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.000
For the rest,

27
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.530
we're gonna need a system.

28
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.570
As I said,

29
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.390
we'll start out simply by learning a couple of methods,

30
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.600
memorizing single digit numbers.

31
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660
You may have come across these before,

32
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.300
perhaps even in junior school,

33
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.340
but they are incredibly useful,

34
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.930
and I still use them today.

35
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.890
then we'll progress to memorize in longer numbers,

36
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.390
incredibly long numbers.

37
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.860
If the mood takes you on,

38
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.210
I'll show you two systems.

39
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.140
The first is developed by a gentleman named Stanley slaves mink on one side in the 17th

40
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.630
century.

41
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.750
Boy that stood the test of time called the major system.

42
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.760
And then the newer system developed by a fellow Brit named Dominic O Brien a little more

43
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.280
recently called the Dominic System.

44
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.350
Okay,

45
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.690
so that's the introduction.

46
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.690
Let's crack on.
