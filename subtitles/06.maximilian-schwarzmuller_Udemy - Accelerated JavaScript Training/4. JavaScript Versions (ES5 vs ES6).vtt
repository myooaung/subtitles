Before we actually get started with the course,

2

00:00:04.230  -->  00:00:05.670
let's talk about ES5

3

00:00:05.670  -->  00:00:11.440
versus ES6 or let's talk what ES5 and ES6 means to begin with.

4

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:17.310
ES stands for ECMAScript and now you might be confused because a few seconds ago, I was talking about

5

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:18.470
Javascript.

6

00:00:18.480  -->  00:00:26.790
Now what's ECMAScript? ECMAScript kind of is the overarching language which has its own committee

7

00:00:26.790  -->  00:00:33.340
if you want to put it like this, which develops language, implements new features or at least decides

8

00:00:33.510  -->  00:00:37.480
which new features should be implemented in the next version and so on

9

00:00:37.620  -->  00:00:41.670
and Javascript therefore is kind of a dialect of ECMAScript, though

10

00:00:41.710  -->  00:00:46.680
you think you can safely say it's the most important one and therefore the two terms are often used

11

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:47.760
interchangeably

12

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:52.280
and as a dialect, it follows the specifications of ECMAScript.

13

00:00:52.320  -->  00:00:59.490
So when I talk about ES5 and ES6, I talk about versions of this language and currently, ES5 is the

14

00:00:59.490  -->  00:01:05.850
most recent version which means it's supported by all major browsers even for a bit of the older versions

15

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:07.280
of these browsers.

16

00:01:07.460  -->  00:01:09.250
ES6 will be the next big thing,

17

00:01:09.270  -->  00:01:14.880
it will be the next version of Javascript if you want to put it like this and it implements many cool

18

00:01:14.880  -->  00:01:21.150
features and indeed, you can check out my ES6 bootcamp to learn about those new features.

19

00:01:21.330  -->  00:01:26.520
However ES6 is not supported by all browsers yet and oftentimes you will need some polyfills

20

00:01:26.550  -->  00:01:29.280
or transpilers which actually transpile 

21

00:01:29.310  -->  00:01:33.240
your code back to ES5 versions which then will work again.

22

00:01:33.300  -->  00:01:35.100
So it's not natively supported and

23

00:01:35.190  -->  00:01:39.020
therefore in this course, I am focusing on ES5,

24

00:01:39.230  -->  00:01:46.860
the code which will actually run for sure and you may check out my ES6 bootcamp for all the new cool

25

00:01:46.860  -->  00:01:51.150
features which you will be able to use in the future.
