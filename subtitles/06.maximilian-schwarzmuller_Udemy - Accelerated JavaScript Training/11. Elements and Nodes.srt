00:00:01,660  -->  00:00:07,810
Now you also heard me say that you could use parent node instead of element.

2

00:00:07,860  -->  00:00:09,730
So what's the difference here?

3

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:21,240
Well basically, all the DOM things you see here for example in the developer tools, in Chrome, are nodes

4

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:28,880
and the DOM consists of nodes, it's built up of nodes and some nodes happen to be elements as well,

5

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:33,750
so all the nodes created from HTML elements like these ones here or this one.

6

00:00:33,750  -->  00:00:39,060
So these are then elements and not nodes or they are nodes but also elements.

7

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:43,020
So here, it really doesn't matter if you use parent node or parent element

8

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:49,410
since we're interested in the parent element anyways but the difference is parent node can also be some

9

00:00:49,410  -->  00:00:56,460
things in the DOM which aren't HTML elements but if you're working with HTML elements and

10

00:00:56,460  -->  00:01:02,790
you want to select an element, well then of course parent element for example here or whatever element

11

00:01:02,880  -->  00:01:05,370
is the way to go instead of whatever node.
