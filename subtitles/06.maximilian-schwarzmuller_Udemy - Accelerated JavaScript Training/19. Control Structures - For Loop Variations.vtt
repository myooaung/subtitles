00:00:01.540  -->  00:00:05.750
So I'll clear this and I'll get rid of this inner loop and all of that.

2

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:11.660
Now an important thing to realize is, you are not only able to set i equal to zero,

3

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:17.960
you of course may also start with two and and then only get 2, 3, 4.

4

00:00:18.000  -->  00:00:26.850
You also can specify other conditions here, like greater or smaller or equal, anything like that

5

00:00:26.850  -->  00:00:34.650
and I will come back to comparison operators soon and you can also not say that you want to add something

6

00:00:34.650  -->  00:00:41.910
to it, you could also say that it should be set equal to i plus three for example, what would happen now?

7

00:00:41.920  -->  00:00:43.050
We

8

00:00:43.650  -->  00:00:50.280
only get two because after the first iteration where i is two, we add three so we get five

9

00:00:50.310  -->  00:00:52.900
and this condition is no longer satisfied,

10

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:58.650
we also can subtract this value or decrement it.

11

00:00:58.650  -->  00:01:04.200
So now we're subtracting one from i upon each iteration

12

00:01:04.350  -->  00:01:12.150
but if I now hit run, we would have a problem because this would be an infinite loop. We have i equal

13

00:01:12.150  -->  00:01:13.060
to,

14

00:01:13.410  -->  00:01:22.410
we subtract one up on each round and our exit condition is that i gets bigger than 5 or our continue

15

00:01:22.620  -->  00:01:26.690
condition is that i is smaller than five.

16

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:32.580
Now this loop would never get exited because since we decrement i, we would always be smaller than five

17

00:01:32.590  -->  00:01:32.990
.

18

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:40.190
So here, we should change this and say only keep this running as long as i

19

00:01:40.410  -->  00:01:42.390
is bigger than one

20

00:01:42.510  -->  00:01:47.810
for example. If I now hit run, we only see two,

21

00:01:47.820  -->  00:01:53.250
so we only make one round because we start with two, subtract 1 and we are 1,

22

00:01:53.250  -->  00:01:55.420
so this is no longer satisfied.

23

00:01:55.740  -->  00:02:01.770
This is how you can play around with loops and how you can set the variable here, i,

24

00:02:01.860  -->  00:02:07.830
and of course you could use another name as well as the way you want it and need it for your program to

25

00:02:07.830  -->  00:02:09.470
work correctly.
