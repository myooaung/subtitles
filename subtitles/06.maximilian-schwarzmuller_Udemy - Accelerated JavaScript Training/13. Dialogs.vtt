00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:09.390
Now what I want to do is, I'll get rid of the HTML part here again, I'll open the console again and I want to

2

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:15.590
introduce you to some built-in dialog

3

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:21.220
the object offers, so dialogs are basically pop-ups the user will see

4

00:00:21.420  -->  00:00:29.560
and one very prominent one which is sometimes also used for debugging instead of console log is the alert

5

00:00:29.560  -->  00:00:29.850
.

6

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:38.610
That's a function on the window object you use like this with an argument of the text you want to present

7

00:00:38.610  -->  00:00:39.820
to the user

8

00:00:40.200  -->  00:00:47.960
and if I then hit run, I get this little window here which tells me this is an alert, the text

9

00:00:47.960  -->  00:00:49.170
I inserted here

10

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:56.490
and I can only click OK. Besides the alert which you should rarely use since there are better ways to

11

00:00:56.490  -->  00:01:00.000
present messages using modals and so on,

12

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:05.700
you'll also get the confirm method.

13

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:09.260
This presents the user with a choice,

14

00:01:09.520  -->  00:01:15.990
so 'are you sure' could be the question and you can also log something here because this method will

15

00:01:15.990  -->  00:01:18.470
return what the user chose.

16

00:01:18.510  -->  00:01:22.160
So if I now hit run, I can click OK or Cancel

17

00:01:22.160  -->  00:01:28.260
and if I click OK, this will return true and if I click Cancel, this will return false and therefore I

18

00:01:28.260  -->  00:01:33.090
can use this in my code to decide what I want to do next depending on the user choice.

19

00:01:33.100  -->  00:01:36.140
However here again, use it with caution,

20

00:01:36.150  -->  00:01:41.670
there are better and more user-friendly ways of presenting dialogs nowadays.

21

00:01:42.330  -->  00:01:49.290
The last dialog I want to show you is the prompt dialog, where you can use or where you can prompt the user

22

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:51.130
for some input,

23

00:01:51.390  -->  00:02:00.840
for example his name. If I run this, I can enter something and whatever I enter here of course is

24

00:02:00.840  -->  00:02:06.330
returned and I can use it, I can not only print it, I could also store it in a variable of course.

25

00:02:06.330  -->  00:02:14.190
So these are three built-in dialogs and as already mentioned a couple of times, really think about

26

00:02:14.190  -->  00:02:22.350
using them because there are better ways, with modals which are kind of in page pop-ups which you can

27

00:02:22.350  -->  00:02:26.630
style much more nicer and so on, you can basically achieve the same

28

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:28.480
but it's a better user experience,

29

00:02:28.500  -->  00:02:30.550
it looks better and it feels better

30

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:36.330
and yes this is really like a 10 year old style here with those dialogs

31

00:02:36.420  -->  00:02:42.750
but they are there and certainly there might be ways or situations where you need them

32

00:02:42.750  -->  00:02:44.480
or where you can use them,

33

00:02:44.730  -->  00:02:49.680
just be aware that there are better ways to solve this. If you're not sure what a modal is,

34

00:02:49.680  -->  00:02:56.520
simply google for Javascript modal and you will find some examples or Bootstrap modals for example. Bootstrap

35

00:02:56.520  -->  00:03:03.060
is a CSS library which ships with pre-defined styles, amongst them some modals which are as I said

36

00:03:03.210  -->  00:03:05.840
just like pop-ups inside your page.
