1

00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:05,810
So I was showing this mediocre way as I call it,

2

00:00:06,030  -->  00:00:09,410
well there is a best way of course as well.

3

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:12,530
Javascript also has query selectors,

4

00:00:12,540  -->  00:00:19,660
so now if I change this and I use a query selector instead, I still use the document object here

5

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:29,730
but then I use query selector and the query selector allows me to select by ID, by class name, by tag

6

00:00:29,730  -->  00:00:32,740
name but all in one single method.

7

00:00:32,760  -->  00:00:34,140
How does it work?

8

00:00:34,140  -->  00:00:36,830
It uses CSS selectors for that.

9

00:00:36,840  -->  00:00:44,370
Now if you're not familiar with CSS, CSS selectors basically are how you define, if writing style

10

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:51,660
sheets, which elements should receive a certain style and you could write a code that all h1 elements

11

00:00:51,660  -->  00:00:58,350
are styled or only elements that have a certain class and the way these CSS selectors look like

12

00:00:58,380  -->  00:00:59,810
are basically that

13

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:06,780
if you have something like h1 without anything else, just a string of h1 here, this would select

14

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:08,670
all h1 elements.

15

00:01:08,670  -->  00:01:16,440
So let's add one here, let's add a h1 element which says header. If I now clear my console,

16

00:01:16,450  -->  00:01:16,510
so

17

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:29,550
if I now execute this code by showing the console just enough that I can click run, like this,

18

00:01:29,550  -->  00:01:33,420
you see we select a header with that query selector.

19

00:01:33,420  -->  00:01:39,960
Now you can also select by class by adding a dot in front of it and then a class name, like simple

20

00:01:39,960  -->  00:01:39,990
and

21

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:43,340
this is how you write it in CSS code as well.

22

00:01:43,380  -->  00:01:46,480
So if I now hit run, we select this

23

00:01:46,550  -->  00:01:54,660
li element. Notice that we don't get an array here and that is because I'm using query selector and this

24

00:01:54,660  -->  00:02:02,160
will only give me the first element which matches this query. If we want to get the array,

25

00:02:02,160  -->  00:02:08,950
so all the elements matching this query, you would have to use query selector all.

26

00:02:09,240  -->  00:02:15,110
If I now hit run, you'll see that now it's an array of list items,

27

00:02:15,180  -->  00:02:18,490
it only has one object but it could hold multiple ones.

28

00:02:18,690  -->  00:02:27,560
So if I add this class to let's say another element and this is your anchor tag, no list item

29

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:29,020
and I hit run again,

30

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:31,150
you'll see both elements here.

31

00:02:31,440  -->  00:02:38,970
But again, if only using query selector without the all, we only get the first one, the list item and

32

00:02:38,970  -->  00:02:40,130
the second one is omitted,

33

00:02:40,140  -->  00:02:42,630
so use whatever you need.

34

00:02:42,630  -->  00:02:45,750
Now this is the class selector,

35

00:02:45,750  -->  00:02:50,580
you may also use the hashtag selector to select by ID.

36

00:02:50,580  -->  00:03:02,750
So if I now add an ID, for example to the header, ID equals easy, then I can select by ID easy here,

37

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:07,130
click run again and you see I get this header.

38

00:03:07,440  -->  00:03:14,220
So this query selector is the fastest possible way to select elements by certain characteristics, be that

39

00:03:14,230  -->  00:03:21,750
their tag name, their ID, their class name, you can also select by attribute or something else

40

00:03:21,750  -->  00:03:24,700
and again to learn more about that,

41

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:31,920
check out how CSS selectors work or check out the document attached, the cheatsheet attached to this

42

00:03:31,950  -->  00:03:36,920
module where you will find a link to the query selector and you're able to learn more

43

00:03:37,170  -->  00:03:39,260
but generally that is how it works

44

00:03:39,330  -->  00:03:42,240
and that is how you select elements with it.

45

00:03:42,240  -->  00:03:50,460
Now of course with the elements selected, you may still use style, background color and set it equal to

46

00:03:50,460  -->  00:03:52,080
red for example and I'll

47

00:03:52,140  -->  00:03:59,520
get out of my console log, hit run and in order to see it I'll show the output as well, close

48

00:03:59,610  -->  00:04:05,450
this so that it's a bit more easy to see and again, hit run, it's getting red here.

49

00:04:05,610  -->  00:04:07,650
So this still works,

50

00:04:07,650  -->  00:04:11,790
that is what the selector is there for, to work with it but it makes it easier,

51

00:04:11,820  -->  00:04:14,040
you don't have these chained calls

52

00:04:14,040  -->  00:04:15,790
instead it's very simple

53

00:04:15,930  -->  00:04:21,560
and of course as I said, you can use multiple ways to select your elements here.
