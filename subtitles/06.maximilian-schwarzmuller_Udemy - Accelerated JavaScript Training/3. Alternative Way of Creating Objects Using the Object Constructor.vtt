00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:08.130
For example it's interesting to learn how else we could create an object. Here we're using the literal

2

00:00:08.130  -->  00:00:14.220
notation which means we're writing it directly here in the code and this is a very convenient notation

3

00:00:14.310  -->  00:00:19.630
and one you'll often use. A different way to create an object

4

00:00:19.740  -->  00:00:27.420
and I'll just reduce this to be a more simpler object for now again, another way would be to create

5

00:00:27.840  -->  00:00:31.980
another person here as a new object.

6

00:00:32.160  -->  00:00:38.430
Now object here is a built-in object indeed Javascript ships with

7

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:43.000
and we can instantiate a new version of this object with the new keyboard.

8

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:51.360
This basically tells Javascript create a new object for me. Now rightfully, you would be saying but where

9

00:00:51.370  -->  00:00:54.590
is the name and the age field if you want to create another person?

10

00:00:54.600  -->  00:00:58.410
We're not specifying it here, we're using the generic object object

11

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:03.290
Javascript ships with. Well we would have to add these fields,

12

00:01:03.510  -->  00:01:15.360
so we would have to say anotherPerson.name equals Anna and of course, anotherPerson.age equals

13

00:01:15.530  -->  00:01:19.830
whatever, 30, whatever you like

14

00:01:20.010  -->  00:01:27.720
and then of course we could print out another person

15

00:01:27.960  -->  00:01:32.900
and if I hit run, you see that this object was created.

16

00:01:32.940  -->  00:01:35.730
So that's a different way to create an object

17

00:01:35.940  -->  00:01:43.770
but as you probably already see, this method here is preferable because it's much faster and it's also

18

00:01:43.770  -->  00:01:47.180
not only faster but more explicit. By looking at it,

19

00:01:47.190  -->  00:01:53.800
we directly see how this object looks like. Here, we have to see ok, it's name and age,

20

00:01:53.820  -->  00:01:54.390
so it

21

00:01:54.510  -->  00:01:56.010
takes longer.

22

00:01:56.160  -->  00:02:01.670
So this way of creating it certainly has some advantages

23

00:02:01.770  -->  00:02:05.190
but you do have this other way here too.
