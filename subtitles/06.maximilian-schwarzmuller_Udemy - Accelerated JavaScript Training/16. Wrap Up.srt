1

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:07,610
With all that, I think you should have a solid understanding why objects are important, why they aren't

2

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:15,510
difficult at all, how you can create objects, how prototypes are important when it comes to inheritance

3

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:24,000
or kind of fallback places where certain methods or fields could be, how constructor functions make

4

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:33,780
it easy for you to create your own objects of pre-defined blueprints, how you can use different functions

5

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:41,380
or methods or things like this for/in loop here to work with your objects and how the this keyword

6

00:00:41,400  -->  00:00:47,610
can be tricky but can be handled with bind or call or apply.

7

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:53,740
This has been a rather long module but objects are of course a key part of Javascript

8

00:00:53,850  -->  00:01:00,870
and I'm very happy that we're now at the point that the basics as well as objects as well as arrays as

9

00:01:00,870  -->  00:01:04,310
well as types and scopes are all set

10

00:01:04,470  -->  00:01:08,460
and hopefully, you feel comfortable with those concepts,

11

00:01:08,520  -->  00:01:15,510
if not as always check out the cheatsheets attached to the last lectures. There you'll find more descriptions

12

00:01:15,540  -->  00:01:23,940
as well as links leading to resources which may allow you to get a bit deeper into the different concepts

13

00:01:23,940  -->  00:01:25,200
explained here.

14

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:32,370
I'm looking forward to the next module where we will have a look at errors and how we can debug

15

00:01:32,400  -->  00:01:33,010
them

16

00:01:33,090  -->  00:01:39,900
before we dive deeper into functions and what we can do with them in Javascript. See you there. Bye.
