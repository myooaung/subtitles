00:00:01,470  -->  00:00:07,440
So we covered a lot throughout this course and you learned a lot of important pieces to work with Javascript,

2

00:00:07,680  -->  00:00:11,960
to write your own applications and where Javascript comes in handy

3

00:00:11,960  -->  00:00:16,950
and of course we have thousands of examples showcasing all those parts.

4

00:00:16,950  -->  00:00:23,750
I think it's always a great thing to have some kind of project where those parts come together

5

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:27,640
and whilst of course you can't cover every piece of that,

6

00:00:27,810  -->  00:00:33,990
I want to show the most important ones and I want to give you an overall feeling of how such a project

7

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:40,920
looks like and that should enable you to transfer all the knowledge you gained throughout this course into any

8

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:47,800
project and work with the DOM, with the website, work with the user, work with a real website.

9

00:00:47,820  -->  00:00:48,690
So let's start.
