00:00:01.590  -->  00:00:06.330
I think it's important to practice this and to see how this works,

2

00:00:06.480  -->  00:00:13.170
so let's play around with that a little bit more and let's change the background color or certain properties

3

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:15.750
of different parts of our code here.

4

00:00:16.170  -->  00:00:23.210
Let's say we want to select this link element here, this link, inside the first list item.

5

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:27.400
Notice that we neither have a class nor an ID.

6

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:29.170
How would this work?

7

00:00:29.790  -->  00:00:36.890
Well we can use a query selector to select the list item because we know we want the first list items,

8

00:00:36.890  -->  00:00:42.110
so I don't use query selector all because I don't want to get an array of all list items,

9

00:00:42.150  -->  00:00:45.380
I only want to get the first one. However

10

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:51.870
it's even easier than that, I can directly select the first anchor tag in this page because this is the

11

00:00:51.870  -->  00:00:52.870
one I want,

12

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:59.340
so I'll just use a here and then I want to set the background color to red.

13

00:00:59.340  -->  00:01:05.790
Now if I hit run, you see that this link changed to red.

14

00:01:05.790  -->  00:01:14.790
Now here are some exercises for you; imagine we want to select this link here and change the background

15

00:01:14.790  -->  00:01:16.680
color to red,

16

00:01:16.680  -->  00:01:18.840
how would you do it?

17

00:01:20.220  -->  00:01:27.240
Well the way I would do it is, as we have a class here, I'll simply use the query selector to select

18

00:01:27.240  -->  00:01:28.260
a class,

19

00:01:28.370  -->  00:01:33.920
simple but recognise that we have two elements with this class

20

00:01:33.960  -->  00:01:39.810
and if we don't use query selector all, we would only select the first one.

21

00:01:39.930  -->  00:01:45.900
So in order to get the second one here, I'll use query selector all

22

00:01:46.180  -->  00:01:53.730
and on that array, I'll access the element with the index one which of course is the second element.

23

00:01:54.000  -->  00:01:59.300
If I now hit run, you'll see we changed this link here.

24

00:01:59.380  -->  00:02:07.540
What if we want to change the text of this link to say, let's say hello or whatever you like,

25

00:02:07.600  -->  00:02:09.960
how would you do that?

26

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:13.920
Well there are multiple ways.

27

00:02:14.490  -->  00:02:21.030
One possible way is to select the first element with a class of simple which is this list item and then

28

00:02:21.030  -->  00:02:28.570
we're using some traversing, I don't need that array access here but I can now select the first element

29

00:02:28.600  -->  00:02:28.720
child 

30

00:02:28.870  -->  00:02:32.070
and of course we may use that method,

31

00:02:32.070  -->  00:02:35.180
I'm not talking against using traversal,

32

00:02:35.190  -->  00:02:42.510
I was just saying that I don't like these long chain selection methods but here, this is perfectly

33

00:02:42.510  -->  00:02:43.360
fine.

34

00:02:43.680  -->  00:02:52.850
So I used the first element child property to get this link and then we'll change the text content to

35

00:02:54.500  -->  00:02:55.680
Hello,

36

00:02:55.680  -->  00:03:01.980
so watch our output here if I hit run, the link changed to hello.

37

00:03:02.900  -->  00:03:08.920
What If I want to create a new element? We'll have a look at that in the next video.
