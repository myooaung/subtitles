00:00:01.680  -->  00:00:08.940
So we had a look at the if statement, another control structure based on the condition or the values

2

00:00:08.970  -->  00:00:19.380
of certain variables is the switch statement. I'll create a new variable which I call luckyNumber and I

3

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:21.740
set this equal to 8.

4

00:00:21.750  -->  00:00:29.310
Now I create a switch statement by typing switch and then in parentheses, the value or the variable on

5

00:00:29.310  -->  00:00:30.890
which I want to switch,

6

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:32.570
so luckyNumber here,

7

00:00:32.880  -->  00:00:40.800
then I also have curly braces and inside of these curly braces, I now define several cases I want to

8

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:41.880
handle.

9

00:00:41.880  -->  00:00:48.630
So generally with the switch statement, I look at a variable and then I decide what to do upon setting

10

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:50.940
values this variable might have.

11

00:00:51.100  -->  00:00:54.180
So for example, I might have the case that a variable is one

12

00:00:54.360  -->  00:00:56.540
and I do this like this, case

13

00:00:56.580  -->  00:01:04.500
and then the value I want to handle and then a colon, then I enter a new line and I don't need curly braces

14

00:01:04.500  -->  00:01:13.990
here and I write for example, console log is 1

15

00:01:15.510  -->  00:01:17.870
and then I have to type break,

16

00:01:18.180  -->  00:01:20.770
I'll come back to this keyword soon.

17

00:01:20.850  -->  00:01:29.910
I also want to handle the case that it is 8 for example and then I will log is 8,

18

00:01:30.560  -->  00:01:35.370
also break here and then I have a special case here,

19

00:01:35.520  -->  00:01:42.840
the default case which I specify with the default keyword. This code here is executed whenever this value

20

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:43.530
in this case

21

00:01:43.530  -->  00:01:46.420
here is something else than 1 or 8,

22

00:01:46.830  -->  00:01:51.710
so I'll print default then and also break here.

23

00:01:52.290  -->  00:02:00.360
What do you think we'll see if I hit run? Well we get this 8 because we're switching this number and we're

24

00:02:00.360  -->  00:02:02.540
handling the case that it is 8.

25

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:03.690
What do you think 

26

00:02:03.680  -->  00:02:11.510
we'll see if I change this to 7? We get default because we're only handling the cases that it's

27

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:18.150
1 or 8, in all other cases, we will run this default code here.

28

00:02:18.270  -->  00:02:25.710
So with the switch statement, we have an easy way to execute conditional code depending on the value of

29

00:02:25.720  -->  00:02:34.320
something and this could also be written as an if statement where we check if luckyNumber equals

30

00:02:34.410  -->  00:02:39.620
1 and then we would print this and then we would have

31

00:02:39.670  -->  00:02:51.330
else if luckyNumber equals 8 and then we would execute this code and then we would have else and

32

00:02:51.330  -->  00:02:56.820
then we would print default here and this would do the same as this statement

33

00:02:56.970  -->  00:03:03.720
and in this case, this might even look shorter but imagine us handling multiple cases. This here is

34

00:03:03.720  -->  00:03:05.490
much more structured,

35

00:03:05.760  -->  00:03:14.190
whereas here we have to write all these else if statements which quickly becomes very inconvenient

36

00:03:14.190  -->  00:03:14.490
and

37

00:03:14.490  -->  00:03:20.600
that is why we have this switch statement to make such cases easier.
