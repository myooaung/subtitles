00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:12.150
Now I'll go back to printing out the variable and I want to show another and for now, the last very important

2

00:00:12.390  -->  00:00:22.440
value or data structure in Javascript, an object and I'll have a complete module on objects in this

3

00:00:22.440  -->  00:00:27.840
course but I want to get started with it right now since we're talking about variables in general and

4

00:00:27.840  -->  00:00:30.370
which values you can assign to variables,

5

00:00:30.480  -->  00:00:32.610
an object is such a value.

6

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:40.710
One of the quickest ways to create an object in Javascript is to use curly braces and then you may expand

7

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:42.390
this too over multiple lines,

8

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:43.470
this will work

9

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:49.490
and here, you can create fields and methods.

10

00:00:49.680  -->  00:00:55.460
Now fields are basically variables inside an object if you want to put it like this,

11

00:00:55.570  -->  00:01:02.200
also referred to as properties and methods are functions inside variables and no worries, I'll come back

12

00:01:02.200  -->  00:01:04.130
to both things soon.

13

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:12.900
So I could specify name here and now I'm not assigning a value with an equal sign but inside of an object

14

00:01:13.020  -->  00:01:20.010
indicated by the curly braces here, I assign it by typing colon and then the value, for example Max,

15

00:01:20.100  -->  00:01:22.530
which is a string here of course.

16

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:23.690
Now what do you think

17

00:01:23.700  -->  00:01:29.210
I'll see if I print var1 to the console?

18

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:35.530
Well I see object object and then the actual object.

19

00:01:35.610  -->  00:01:38.490
So I see the object I just created

20

00:01:38.820  -->  00:01:46.460
but the cool thing about objects is I can also access this name directly by typing dot and then name,

21

00:01:46.500  -->  00:01:56.540
so the name of this field which happens to be name here. If I now click run, we see Max,

22

00:01:56.550  -->  00:02:03.140
so this string. So now I'm kind of accessing a variable, even though you would call it property or field inside

23

00:02:03.150  -->  00:02:04.700
my object here

24

00:02:04.920  -->  00:02:11.310
and objects are very important data structures since you may have multiple fields or nested fields and

25

00:02:11.310  -->  00:02:16.560
functions inside them, so you can kind of group different functionalities

26

00:02:16.560  -->  00:02:23.770
and you will work with objects quite a lot in your code and we will see objects quite a lot throughout

27

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:25.760
this course as well.

28

00:02:25.770  -->  00:02:31.170
So what's the type of this object? If I run

29

00:02:34.410  -->  00:02:35.550
typeof

30

00:02:36.180  -->  00:02:44.350
and now I hit run, it's object, so that probably wasn't too surprising

31

00:02:44.430  -->  00:02:48.770
but as I just explained, this is an object and it's of type object of course

32

00:02:48.770  -->  00:02:49.280
therefore.
