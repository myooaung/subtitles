00:00:01,200  -->  00:00:04,050
So how do Javascript events work?

2

00:00:04,080  -->  00:00:11,760
We have the general event interface and I'm on the page of this built-in object on the Mozilla

3

00:00:11,760  -->  00:00:17,250
Developer Network which is generally a great resource for all kinds of Javascript related questions

4

00:00:17,260  -->  00:00:17,510
.

5

00:00:17,760  -->  00:00:19,240
So this is a general event

6

00:00:19,260  -->  00:00:25,980
Javascript offers and then you have multiple specific events which kind of implement this top level

7

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:32,790
event and therefore all events in Javascript share certain properties and methods which you find

8

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:39,330
listed on these pages here and there are especially some specific properties and methods which

9

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:42,080
are important and to which I'll come back later.

10

00:00:42,540  -->  00:00:48,770
So this is the event interface or the general event object and as I said, you have then specific events to

11

00:00:48,770  -->  00:00:53,460
which you can listen. How can you listen or handle an event?
