00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:08,580
Now sometimes, you don't want a library like jQuery but you want to build a real single page application

2

00:00:08,640  -->  00:00:12,040
which means everything is handled through Javascript,

3

00:00:12,180  -->  00:00:15,560
the whole user experience is handled by Javascript.

4

00:00:15,570  -->  00:00:20,580
This is very modern nowadays and there are quite some frameworks doing this for you,

5

00:00:20,640  -->  00:00:25,370
one popular and brand new one is Angular 2 for example.

6

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:31,380
Now the difference to jQuery is that this doesn't simply offer some helper methods and functions

7

00:00:32,340  -->  00:00:38,700
but it creates a complete environment in which you can work, you're writing your whole application

8

00:00:38,700  -->  00:00:40,220
with this framework

9

00:00:40,410  -->  00:00:47,520
and yes you still use normal Javascript, though with Angular 2 you use Typescript which is kind of a

10

00:00:47,520  -->  00:00:55,440
superset to it but you may just also use Javascript but you're working in that environment the framework

11

00:00:55,470  -->  00:00:58,860
gives you with all the commands and tools the framework gives you,

12

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:06,450
so it's a much more powerful thing than a library like jQuery which only adds certain parts. This framework

13

00:01:06,450  -->  00:01:09,310
like Angular 2 or ReactJS,

14

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:15,330
frameworks like these give you a lot of power and you have to learn them of course, it's not just

15

00:01:15,330  -->  00:01:21,750
like throwing them into your project and you're good to go but it's very modern nowadays to use such

16

00:01:21,750  -->  00:01:22,590
frameworks,

17

00:01:22,630  -->  00:01:27,110
so definitely consider checking out courses on for example Angular 2,

18

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:29,040
I do have a course on that if you're interested

19

00:01:29,050  -->  00:01:30,950
for example, to learn more.
