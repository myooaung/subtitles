00:00:01.230  -->  00:00:02.400
So we're nearing the end

2

00:00:02.410  -->  00:00:05.630
but here's one important piece of Javascript I

3

00:00:05.680  -->  00:00:12.120
also want to talk about, AJAX or as it is officially named, the XMLHttpRequest.

4

00:00:12.180  -->  00:00:18.690
Now the name is a bit difficult and also a bit wrong because you can use it for transfering other data than

5

00:00:18.710  -->  00:00:27.060
just XML but what this request or this object basically allows you to do is, it allows you to reach out to the

6

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:33.600
Internet, to the web and load or post data from within Javascript.

7

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:41.130
So this is for example what allows you to update a page with new tweets or new news or whatever that

8

00:00:41.130  -->  00:00:48.060
you fetched in the background through Javascript and then rendered it to the view or rendered it to the page

9

00:00:48.240  -->  00:00:51.640
with the methods you learned before to manipulate the DOM.

10

00:00:51.660  -->  00:00:58.740
So a very important piece and you probably will oftentimes use a library or a framework to handle

11

00:00:58.750  -->  00:01:02.640
this but nonetheless, it's important to learn the basics on how to use it

12

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:08.670
and I'll also give you the resources or link to a resource to learn more about it if you want to dive

13

00:01:08.700  -->  00:01:10.320
really deep into it.

14

00:01:10.320  -->  00:01:11.070
So let's start.
