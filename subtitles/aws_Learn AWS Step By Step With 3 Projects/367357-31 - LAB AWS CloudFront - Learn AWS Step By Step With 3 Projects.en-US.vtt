00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hello,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.600
guys.

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.630
Welcome to another session in decision.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.390
We're going to do lab for eight of Louis Cloudfront.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.850
So let's look into the steps,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.890
water their steps we're going to follow.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.750
So these are the steps which we're going to perform in this lab.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.250
So to configure cloudfront,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.150
we will first create as three bucket and upload.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.740
The content will upload and you made over here.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.030
And then we will create the cloudfront distribution and configure it once it is being done

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.030
.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.650
Then we will create an esti able file that as table file has the reference off three meat

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.960
and that references off cloudfront distribution,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.890
which we have created in the second step.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.360
And once it is being done,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.960
then we relaxes the file a stable file and we will very find that whether our images

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770
loading or not using cloudfront distribution,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.790
let's jump into the AWS management console,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.650
performed these steps.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.570
So we're in tow AWS management console.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.050
So let's create as three work it first to create a three.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.480
Work it,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.250
you need to goto the storage and click on a story.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.040
Click here.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.790
So here we will create a bucket.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.560
We ate a bucket.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.480
We will click on Create Book It better that I have already explained in one off our session

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.420
and here you will provide a unique name we're going to provide.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.960
And that should be in the small kids,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.240
which I have mentioned earlier.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.950
The move.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.290
And here you should provide a unique name so used to a great demo.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.990
Oh,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.550
friend,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.830
to the reason over here nearest reason for my kids it is that's your Prestwick.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.820
One way click on Next we leave it.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.850
The default option will click on next again.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.700
And here we will de select the local public access.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.940
Then click on next and here we will click on Create Bucket.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.380
So our work it God created now go inside the bucket and upload an object to click on upload

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.680
Witter cornered filed And here we will select any Wait for it.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.210
Then we will click on next thing here the set permission.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.530
We will provide it as a public as it is that the more we will choose the grand public read

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.170
access toe this object it is giving us warning.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.920
That is fine.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.250
Next and here we relieve the option as it click on Next on Click on upload.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.770
It has applauded their trial.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740
So we have performed the first step.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.300
That is,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.240
we have created eyes.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.830
Three bucket.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.390
We have applauded the country,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.230
no moving toe.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.220
The second step,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.160
that is a creator cloudfront distribution and configure.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.520
So let's go into the AWS management pencil.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.170
So here you can click on services and here you will get into the network and content

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.390
delivery you need to select cloudfront.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.200
And here you need to click on create distribution.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.460
We have to select the Web and here we need to specify the bucket,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.030
which is going to be origin for this distribution.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.120
So we will select this bucket which we have created,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.470
and we will leave all the options as is.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680
So let's look into the options,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.490
which is being every level over here.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.690
So you will find that there are various configuration is every level which you can set toe

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.100
as but your project need.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.950
So let's look in tow one by one.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.350
So origin domain name,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.110
which we already provided where we have given the reference off our rest Reebok it,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.900
then we have origin pot.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.420
This is an optional field.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.500
You can use this configuration when you want cloudfront to request your country from her

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.630
directory office.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.880
Three.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.360
Work it,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.610
then you can specify Like this.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.770
Use last on the name of the folder.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.330
You can specify you over here,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.280
it residing.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.390
This s three.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.980
Work it as we don't have.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.070
We can leave it as is next.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.590
Moving toe the origin 90 origin 90 is being auto populated.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.700
If you want to change,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.710
you can change it moving toe Another option that is a district bucket access basically this

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.340
configuration you can use when you want that nobody can access the content using as three

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.590
You,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.150
Earl And you only want to distribute the contrary or serve your content through cloudfront

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.150
.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.640
Then you can choose the yes option Over here.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.680
This is useful in a scenario where we're using signed cookies to restrict the access to our

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.270
content.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.210
On that time.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.580
It is really very helpful.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.110
So for this demo,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.880
we will keep it.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.390
As is the default option.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.780
No,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.740
no moving photo origin custom had us.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.730
If you have any custom headers,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.100
then on that time you can use it over here.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.420
So this is related to the origin settings?

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.230
No moving forward and we will look into default cash behavior settings.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.240
So here the part pattern configuration here mints and a strict as treatments forward.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.840
All requests to the origin Unspecified way,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.520
the origin whatever the origin setting we have provided over here.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.500
So it will forward the request toe that origin now moving for though the we were protocol

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.080
policy.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.450
So here you can choose that s TTP and STT ps particle as we're configuring the web

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.250
cloudfront So that means with the help of this configuration,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.290
you are telling that the content can be accessed using either STP or as TTP s protocol.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.230
If you want to specify only https,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.590
then you can use the third option.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.550
And suppose if we want your all content will be accessed through STT PS irrespective off

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.950
users typing as TTP request,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.310
then you will use those second option.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.290
So what will happen that when user type the web address using s TTP,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.940
then it will be redirected toe STT ps no moving photo,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.950
another option or say another conflagration that is allowed us to two p method.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.140
So here you can specify that.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.780
What are the operations you want to perform,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.660
if any request is coming from restaurant pH to access the content off as three using

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.190
cloudfront with the rest API eyes or any of the Web service technologist now moving for the

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.710
Let's discuss about three level encryption conflict reliable encryption configuration used

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.750
when we're using the private content.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.550
So on that time you will get this option enables.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.470
Currently,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.140
we're having a public content,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.600
so that means it is accessible from anywhere.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.750
So that's why it is they will over here.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.340
Let this was about another configuration that is cast as TTP methods.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.460
So this configuration is directly bind with the allowed US to Tippi method,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.630
whichever you will choose.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.260
You will get the option over here.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.800
If you specify that you can get the option over here.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.180
What has TTP method you want to cast for This guy should behave between the report case

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.860
we're using Get and head in cash based on selected request traitors configuration.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.170
You can specify whether you want cloudfront toe cash your object based on these values.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.000
So we will discuss about these Well,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.680
is no non option means cloudfront doesn't cash your object based on header values.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.150
Then we have other option called waitlist and here you can specify which header you want to

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.370
cash your objects.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.320
But in our case,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.750
we're using S three that the reason it was telling that avoid using white listing headers.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.030
So these are the headers,

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.350
which is why it listed had us white list Header means it is a recommended from aid of Louis

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.350
.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.370
If you have any custom headers,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.560
you can insert those as well and moving further,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.930
we will have another option that is called All So all cloud friend doesn't cast the object

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.240
that are associated with this cash behavior instead,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.380
what cloudfront do cloudfront cents every request to the origin?

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.150
But we're going to stick with the default configuration that is none.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.070
No moving toe,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.520
the other conflagration that is object cashing.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.860
With this configuration,

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.160
you can control your object How long the object is stained the cloudfront cash.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.530
If you don't want to change any configuration,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.640
then you should stick with the origin cachet,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.140
headers.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.060
But if you want to customize it,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.320
then you need to select customize option and then afterwards you need to mention minimum T

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.050
teal DT.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.740
Let's turn for time to live and also maximum tea till The third option,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.970
which you're getting over here,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.590
is the default eat eel that is a representation off 24 hours period time that is coming

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.730
86,400 this values representation off seconds.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.190
If you calculate 60 multiplied by 60 multiplied were 24.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.470
Then you will find this value 86,400.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.810
That is a representation off 24 hours.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.320
Next configuration item is forward cookies.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.240
This option doesn't apply to an image honest three bucket unless it's configured as a

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.390
website ID point.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:31.240
It is used to specify whether we want chloroform toe forward cookies to our origins over

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.090
and again here,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.410
we're finding various options like wait list and all.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.150
You can mention the white list,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.680
which are the white list cookies.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.050
And if you choose all cloudfront forward all cookies,

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.490
regardless off how many cookies your application is using now moving to the another

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.550
conflagration that is credit string forward and cashing.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.110
So this is mainly related to the query string configuration,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.250
where you can specify forward all cash based on wait list for query,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:03.630
string forwarding and cashing a specified the credit string perimeter that you want

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.990
cloudfront to use as a basis for cashing no moving further to the other conflagration that

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.060
is a smoothie streaming.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.660
So this configuration basically used for media distribution using Microsoft IAEA sober.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.760
So in our case,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.180
we're sticking with No,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.950
no,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.720
moving further.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.630
So restrict We were access Has two options.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.430
One is yes,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.910
Another one is no Jews.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.290
Yes,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.890
if you want request for object that match the path pattern which we have a specified over

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.220
here,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.340
the path pattern for this cash behavior to use public,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.960
you are else and you should choose No when you want request for object That master part

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.770
pattern for this cash behavior to use signed you worlds There is another configuration that

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.730
is called compress object automatically complex object automatically.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.280
Configuration has also two options that is yes and no choose yes,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.050
when you want,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:01.120
cloudfront can compress your content so that downloads are faster because the files are a

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.120
smaller and that helps your way pages render faster for your users,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.050
we're sticking,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.920
nor with the set up there is another conflagration that is called Lambda Function

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.700
associations.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.500
In this configuration us specify the image and resource name off lambda function that you

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.050
want to add a trigger for If you're not understanding all this lambda function,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.150
just leave it.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.860
Just consider it as a way by which we can automate the process.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.920
With the need of Louis,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.330
I will be covering all this lambda function in another course for this course it is out off

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:33.740
a school.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:39.250
So just consider that it is one of the way by which you can automate the processes within

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.070
your ws.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.530
No,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.420
we understand that default cash behavior settings,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.200
no moving toe,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.570
the distribution settings.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.350
So first is the price class that is mainly related with the pricing thing.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.140
Then there is another conflagration that is AWS ref,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.120
Weap related toe,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.360
the Web application firewall that helps you to monitor the STD PNDs TTP its request that

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.410
are forwarded toe cloudfront and it tells you to control the access to your content.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.550
There is another conflagration that is alternate domain name.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.960
This is an optional configuration you can use when you want to specify one or more domain

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.460
names that you want to use.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.440
You are ill for your objects.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.430
There is other conflagration that is assistant certificate.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.680
You can assign your pseudo SSL certificate by choosing customers.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.190
It's a certificate option in the other configuration item that is supported,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:33.420
as typically wasn't where you can specify the which protocol was enough.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.050
STP you want to use?

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.870
There is another conflagration that is called the full truth object This configuration.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:45.740
You can use it when you want cloudfront to return When of you were request points to your

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.040
route.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.060
You are ill when you specify the default route.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.270
Object Inter.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.400
Only the object name.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.810
For example,

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:53.920
the root off your site.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.940
If it is indexed or test email,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.060
then you should specify one leader.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:04.900
Index daughters Tamil with ordo slash What I mean to say that you don't specify like this.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.110
You should,

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.470
especially for anyone leaned,

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.010
extorted female when you're using it.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.920
In our example,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.860
we're not using it.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.490
There is another configuration that is logging.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.390
It has to option when his own under the one is off.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.230
If you're choosing on option,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:24.260
then you need to specify image on his three bucket that you want cloudfront to his true

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.170
access logs.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.500
Cloudfront records information about each end user request for an object and his toes.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.030
The filing a specified image on this three bucket no moving further.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.450
There is another configuration that is an apple.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.260
I PV sick.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.800
If you want to use this particle,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.370
you can use it so by default to deserve a level.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.740
If you don't want to use it,

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.970
just uncheck this one.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.550
And if you have any comment,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.250
you can specify over here.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.380
And there is last configuration that is distribution in ST if you're selected enabled.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.270
That means as soon as the distribution is fully deployed,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.250
you can deploy links that you the distributions domain name and users can retrieve content

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.250
.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:07.080
So these other details which I have discussed about all the configuration item off the

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.800
cloudfront.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.830
If you have any doubt about any off the configuration than you can refer,

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.880
these i e.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.190
Con.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.540
That is for information.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.210
And it will also give you the details.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:22.240
Vote what this field is used for so you can refer this icon anytime whenever you have any

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.340
doubt about any of the configuration now moving for,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:25.560
though,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.950
we will click on create distribution with the default option in this lab,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.780
we're going to use only this configuration we're providing and keeping all the things as

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.790
default option.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.550
So let's click on create distribution.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.950
So it is in progress.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.030
The status is in progress once it is being completed,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.190
then I will come back one.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:45.430
No,

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.770
I'm just pausing it now.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.070
Cloudfront distribution has been created on deployed.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:55.350
Now let's look into the next to step What we have to do now we have completely creation

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.710
office three bucket and creation off cloudfront distribution and configuration.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.010
Also,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.860
we have completed now the total step we need to create an estimate file and we will access

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.940
with the CLOUDFRONT Deena's and we will use the cats image which we have applauded while

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.600
creation off s three bucket.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.630
And when we have created that's true.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.930
A bucket on that.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.330
We have applauded and he made off cats.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.580
Let me show the image.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:24.470
So this is the image we will use in our as Tamil Page and we will access the estimable paid

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.390
from our cloudfront Venus.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.920
So let's create an estimate file and then we will upload that estimable file U S three

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.810
bucket and that his team will file.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.130
We relaxes through cloudfront venous.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:42.060
So now let me show you The cloud for Indian is so let's jump into AWS management console

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.650
toe Grab the Deena's off cloudfront.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.050
You need to click on I d.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.810
And here you need to click on origin and origin groups.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.760
And this is the part that is the DNS part off cloudfront.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.250
So we will use this one.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.620
So now we will create an estimable file,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.340
and then we will upload it to this three bucket and that we relaxes through this.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:03.940
Dennis,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.680
that is cloud friendliness.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.090
So let me open visuals to the accord.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.070
So I'm into visual story accord.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.650
Let's create a file as Tim and file.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.290
To do that,

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:19.080
we need to go to the file new file and here we will create an esteem will find to do that

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.400
for Save it,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:20.720
say,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.990
Vitter's Estermann,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.000
give it a name.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.980
My cats No test chairman save No,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.420
We will write that female coat.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.910
So I will use the snippet over here as human five.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:41.200
And here we will provide the title my cats from clothes front demo And within that we can

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.290
access the image to add an image.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:51.210
So here we can access image And here we need to provide the source.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.490
What is the source we're going to use here?

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.810
We will use their Dennis off cloud friends who?

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.200
Let's grab their Deena's.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.970
I will copy this dreariness and then I will paste over here after that Here,

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:11.090
we need to make sure that we will be passing as TTP the object which we want to access from

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.530
the history to let me grab the name of the object with industry.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.470
I am in tow My bucket.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:22.290
I will click on this bucket and here this is the name we want.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:29.600
So grab this name Onda We will paste here So that means this images coming from Cloudfront

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:36.650
Deena's so see a really using cloudfront nearness to access this a me off s three bucket No

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.650
,

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:43.350
save it given old name my cats Cloudfront demo and then we will upload it in tow.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.550
The s three bucket This is Tamil Pale and this has terrible filed.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.400
We will access from Cloudfront Lianis.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.460
So let me upload this fine to do that.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.720
Let's go toe There's three bucket So I am into his three bucket.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.370
Come here,

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:09.290
Click on upload add files And here my cats daughters demon we click on next and here we

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.970
will grant the permission as a public access.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.390
Then click on next,

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.790
next and upload.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.550
So it is uploaded now?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.550
No,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.680
we need to access.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.720
This is terrible trial using cloud for venous.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.840
So let's do it.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.220
Let's go toe cloudfront console.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.160
Grab the being this name.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.730
Come here slash my cats.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.370
No test email in tow.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.400
And CEO,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.610
we are accessing my cats detail.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.290
So this is accessing from Cloudfront Deena's.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.260
And this is how you can configure cloudfront Now we have done the exercises.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.220
Now,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.870
as YSL,

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:54.840
we need toe Goto the management console and we can remove every services which we have used

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.750
as it is a demonstration since it will be chargeable.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.960
So make sure that you can remove everything.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.350
You should come here and post removed their distribution.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.110
And then we will remove this tree.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.410
Work it so we will forced visible.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.770
It is desirable,

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.730
dissembling.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.130
And then everything will take time.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.360
So I'm pausing.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:13.990
The video,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.180
once it will do is able We will proceed for the No,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.850
it is done.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.190
Let's select it and delete s still it close.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.690
No,

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.030
Wardo,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.490
there's three.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.140
Work it and we will delete those three.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:26.550
Work it.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:31.420
So we're into his three workers selected and let's delete it.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.260
No select action.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.780
And over here,

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.240
you need to select delete.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.180
Click on delete once it is being done.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.230
No,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.830
we need to delete the bucket.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.660
To do that,

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.050
go to the Amazon s three.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.260
Select the bucket and click on delete.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.950
And here you need toe past the bucket name and then confirm.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.560
So we have deleted.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.740
So we have deleted the work.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.200
It no,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.820
check that,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.690
whether it is accessible so it is gone.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.700
So we have cleaned up everything.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.940
Now let's move to the diagram.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.580
And let's look into that what we have learned.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.450
So in this exercise,

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.230
we have created as three bucket uploaded the content and then we have created a cloudfront

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.010
distribution.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.360
We have configured it.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.960
We have gone through all the configuration details off cloudfront distribution,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.650
and afterwards we have created a steam l file on in that estimate file.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.440
We have used clothes front,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.910
DNS name to access the content off a story bucket.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.330
So this is how we can figure the cloudfront.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.520
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.160
I hope you in your decision.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.890
See you in the next session Till then,

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.220
buh bye.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:40.760
Take care
