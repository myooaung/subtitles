00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hello,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.590
guys.

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.880
Thanks for joining decision.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.540
In this section,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.390
we are going to learn about elastic I p addresses.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.540
So let's jump into the diagram where we have left earlier.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.080
So this is the diagram you are no familiar with.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.850
So so far in the three PC components understanding,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.380
we have learned to votes off nets.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.450
So table Internet Gateway No.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.690
We will discuss a vault elastic AP addresses.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:34.170
So basically an elastic I p addresses static I p address whose design is similar to public

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.530
i p before Edris.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.160
The last take i p address is basically designed for dynamic cloud computing.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.350
So what does it mean?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.720
It means that with an elastic I p address,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.770
we can months the frail euro and instance by rapidly d mapping the address to another

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.620
instance in our repeat e So basically we can associate and elastic appeared with any

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.530
instance on there talking to face for any re busy in our account.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.710
So,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.000
no,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830
we have some idea about elastic I p addresses.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.540
Let's move further and we will discuss about some of the points to remember while walking

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.320
with the last kick I please post going to remember is that in for elastic A pre addresses

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.350
in news that is not chargeable.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.560
But if you create the elastic i p address and you're not using it,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.980
then it is chargeable.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.360
Heat of Lewis has give this building a structure because eight of Louis doesn't want that

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.960
somebody will block the particular i p address and not using it.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330
No moving for,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.660
though Another point to remember is that elastic I p this is can be assigned toe only one

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.830
instance at the time.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.850
Another point to remember is that if we have to see it and elastic i p address returners

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.380
zero network interface off your instance its current public I pretty for is released to the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.030
public KP address pool.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.560
And supposing kids,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.030
if we're disassociating the elastic i p address from the eternal zero networking toe face,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.550
then in that case,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.490
the eternity networking toe phrase is automatically assigned a new public i p before

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.020
address.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.150
And all this happened within a few minutes.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.540
This doesn't have play if we have that has the second networking toe face to our instance.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.000
The another points to remember which we're going to discuss is really,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.190
really interesting and very useful in case of failure.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.260
So the point is we can move in elastic I p address from one's chance to another instance.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.140
The instance can be in the same repeats here another.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.820
We've et So that means with this behavior if,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.200
in case any failure is happening and end user will never come to know that failure has

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.390
happened As we're sticking with the theme static I p address with the help of elastic I p

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.680
address another point to remember for elastic I P addresses is littered with the lifeless

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.190
panel off elastic I p.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.940
Address an elastic I p address remain associated with our AWS account until we explicitly

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.950
released them.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.060
This is also a good design from a job,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.500
Louis,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.120
so that nobody else can use the same i p address without the release or say without its

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.050
availability.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.800
So,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.120
no,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.660
we will move further and we will go to it of with management console and looking toe the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.140
components which we have discussed so far,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.090
along with elastic I p address Guys,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.500
we're having our detail lab for three PC creation where all these component is going to be

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.970
used.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.350
This I'm doing because I want that you should become for table enough.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.980
Whatever we're discussing or save whatever we have discussed so far,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.810
that will make sense in a much greater way.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.420
So let's jump into the AWS management concern.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.680
So we are now into eight of Louis management console.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.730
So here,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.150
how do we can access all those competent?

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.030
So the better ways that we should come here,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.810
click on services and click on Be PC.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.060
You just click on it so it will take you toe the basic management console.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.850
And from there we can get the dashboard along with the component details.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.610
So this is the dashboard off bpc complement.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.910
And here you will find that whatever the components we have discussed so far,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.520
which is existing over here like submits,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.530
wrote table Internet Gate with I will come toe this aggressive only Internet gate with

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.550
component later.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.760
Now we're discussing the elastic.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.940
So the last take I mean,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.350
if you wanted to create,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.080
then you should come over here and used this interfaith were locate new elastic I p.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.450
And so from here,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.870
you can could hear their last two KP actress and that you will associate with this prayer.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.150
What clothes or save with this BBC.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.650
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in this sessions here in the next station.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.980
Tilden.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.370
Bubba,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.950
take you.
