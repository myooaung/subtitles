00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Look,

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.610
guys,

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.640
Thanks for joining decision in decision.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.390
We're going to look in tow aid of Louis clothes front.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.210
So this so what?

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.580
We have seen various services that is designed for a specific focus.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.200
So in the same aspect,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.750
eight of Louis Cloudfront is also designed for for the specific purpose and the purpose is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.830
the DNC improvement off a content?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.850
So what it means.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.490
So as we know that AWS is a spread it across all around the world,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.040
its presence and five continent within five continent,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.710
it is a spread across 22 geographic regions and out off 22 regions.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.850
It has total number off 69 availability Jones.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.350
It has won 55 locations in 65 cities across 29 countries.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.960
So to discuss in more detail,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.370
let's jump in towards Agra,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.550
where we will have a detailed discussion about cloudfront so prior to understanding that

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.610
how cloudfront workforce To understand that what is expedient,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.910
that is content delivery network and what is the edge locations?

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.600
So basically a content delivery network or we can say that content distribution network is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.860
a geographical distributed network,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.160
a proxy servers within the data centers The goal off Cdn is to provide high every ability

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.710
and high performance by distributing the service that is related to the end users.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.970
So you can understand it like this way.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.380
Suppose that if you have an application and that application is hosted in US reason and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.480
when the application is access way this year,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.160
Pacific Region User than the request will hope through issuer Pacific US reach So this

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.310
process off hoping the request from one region to another and when it is getting the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.860
response.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.400
Then again,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.330
it needs toe hope from US region to a CIA Pacific region.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.390
So the entire life cycle Oh,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.140
for request response will take more time to serve the application,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490
toe the user to improve the latency CD and will help us.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.180
So whenever you access the application first time,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.180
so the application will be cares toe the nearest location obsidian and whenever you access

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.250
it first time it would take more time.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.600
But from second time one word it will be very much fast as it doesn't hop through one

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.140
location or save one region to another reason as it is being cast in tow the same region.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.350
So this is what content delivery network used for.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.200
It helps us to wish gas the application for the distribution,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.360
no moving further and discuss the edge locations.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.160
So what is this?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.200
Location and edge location is where End user access services.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900
Located at eight of Louis,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.250
they're located in most of the major cities around the world,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.920
and they're specifically used by Cloudfront to distribute Contento and user to reduce

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.890
latency so you can consider it like front and for the Soviet re access,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.140
which are located in AWS Cloud.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.670
Now proceed for the rest.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.690
Discuss about how cloudfront works or to understand that how chlor print works.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.770
Let's look in tow this diagram in the diagram.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.500
You are looking into a user access our website and requests for estimates file.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.670
Then Deena's roots.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.180
Take the request toe the edge location that can best solve the request,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.820
typically the nearest as location in terms off latency route.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.030
The request toe that is location at the Edge location.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.350
Cloudfront checks its cash for the requested file whether the file is available or not,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.140
and suppose if it is available in the cash,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.050
then cloudfront returns them.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.180
So the user who requested the file and suppose if the fines are not in the cash,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.940
Cloudfront compares the request with their specification in our distribution and forwards

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.220
the request for the files to our origins over for the corresponding file type,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.010
for example,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.950
it may look into imagine as three bucket for the requested file.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.190
Then afterwards,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.940
the origins over sends back the file toe the edge location as it is represented in the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.590
diagram.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.380
And as soon as the first bite derives from the origin,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.790
CLOUDFRONT begins to forward the files to the user and along with that a step globe front.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.330
Also,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.340
add the files toe the cash in the is location for the next time someone request those

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.050
fights cloudfront.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.790
So the request from there's location only.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.100
So this is the way how cloudfront work.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.500
So this is the thing which I wantedto discuss in this session.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.900
In the next session,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.280
we will do the lab for Cloudfront where we will configure the cloudfront so that it will

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.550
deliver our content.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.100
So see you in the next six.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.670
Until then.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.980
Bye bye.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.530
Take care
