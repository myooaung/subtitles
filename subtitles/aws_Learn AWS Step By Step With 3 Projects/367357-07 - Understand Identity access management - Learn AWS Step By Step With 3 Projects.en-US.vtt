00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
low grades will come to another session in this session.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.280
We're going to look into the identity,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.360
excess management,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.490
afraid of us or in this aspect we're going to learn about what it is,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.200
why it is and how we can do that in the world aspect.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.230
We will look into what actually the services and in the way aspect we will look into away.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.310
We're using this services and in the how aspect we were looking toe how to configure the I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.790
am.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.750
So let's jumps into the discussion.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.410
Identity access management is one of the important service or say one of the important

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.110
concept You should know,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.570
right?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.920
We start learning other concepts in a W.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.590
It's as I already mentioned,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.580
that live in our discourse.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.220
Eight of Lewis has various services,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.150
like,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.790
If you see this day a ground,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.230
then you will find that it has very a services and we're going to discuss some of the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.850
important services in the father of coming station.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.090
So no,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.380
let's understand that.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.350
What is I e m?

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.420
That his identity access management.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.260
I will show you one diagram.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.860
Then I will explain that What?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.670
Actually it is.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.250
So look at this diagram.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.200
So this is the major off different,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
different Manus Services off aid of Louis.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.840
And now you consider that we have to use is called usually and user be and you have created

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.350
an account for the user and user.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.960
Very toe work on the respective services creation often account for this particular user

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.850
doesn't mean that they are having access to these services.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.360
So to allow the respective services where these user need to work,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.270
you must have toe provide the access toe that particular services with the need of Louis to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.590
use that service.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.230
If we look closely,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.580
then you will find that AWS is working on authentication and authorization model Rare

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.580
authenticated user is not required toe have on access toe the particular service.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.960
Still,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.940
the time if we haven't authorized to access that service,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.010
for example,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.730
if usually want toe create easy to instance with the program,

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.790
so to rule that he must be having that access.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.740
So here I am,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.560
Identity access management comes into picture.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.620
So all these operations,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.680
or say access related activity,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.150
can be handled with I am identity access management.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.550
So here it comes the first definition off our session.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.520
What is I am identity access management.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.240
So it is one of the mechanism by which you can manage the security off AWS services at a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.350
granular level.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.860
In the fourth position,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.470
I will show you what this granularity means and how to assign a particular rule to a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.760
particular user within I am.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.460
You can also do the user management within your aid of with infrastructure.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.900
So here we understand that what is identity access management and why we had using identity

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.800
access management.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.340
Now we will look in tow.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.230
What are the things we can do within this service?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.450
So with the help off identity access management,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.930
you will set up multi factor authentication.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.850
You will set up users,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.400
users,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.710
management on the group's management.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.320
You can do with the help of identity access management.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.760
So let's move for though,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.100
and do all these exercises and understand it better.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.740
So let's jump into the AWS console toe here.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.880
You will search I am,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.410
and we need to go over here.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.250
So this is how identity and access management So this console will look like you will find

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.840
that dashboard groups,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.700
users,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.720
policies,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.520
rules.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.150
So all these thing you can manage from here for your aid of loose account,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.870
and here you will seem that the security of status So we need to configure these things.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.750
So to market green trick,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.930
you need to configure all these items so we will look into how we can set up this.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.280
So Emma for means multi factor authentication and to set up that we need to follow these

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.950
steps.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.450
But prior to going into the configuration of steps off,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.180
what a deflected authentication.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.980
We must have to understand that what?

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.780
Actually it is so basically multi factor authentication provide an extra layer of security

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.180
for your AWS account.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.840
So why logging along with the user name and password,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.140
you need to provide additional security information which you have configured in the form

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.150
of multi factor authentication.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.000
So this is what we're going to do.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.100
So to do that,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.760
we need to click on manage em affair to here,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.290
click on,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.470
continue to security credentials.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.690
So here you need to select this multi factor authentication.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.320
No,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.360
you need to click on,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.480
activate everything.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.940
So after tricking that you will find that it is giving us three options were sure pretty

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.950
voice you two have to critiquing other hardware.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.880
I'm pretty ways.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.500
So basically some of the companies is using some hardware to authenticate users like Arce.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.440
But here we're going toe.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.190
Use virtual Emma for device and we will set up that what?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.920
You 11 per device as well.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.820
So click on.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.550
Continue.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.840
So after clicking on continue,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.350
you will get this option and here we need to configure it or find a list of comfortable

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.150
applications.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.080
So to do that right click open in Newtown,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.270
we will look into what are those options?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.350
So here you will find the details off the supported devices.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.250
So let's look into that.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.480
So here you will find that we are using what Ulama p so foreign rightful.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.310
We're going to download the Google authenticator.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.470
So you need to go into your players tour and source for Google on 10 indicators or off t

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.230
two factor authentication for both iPhone and then right.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.890
If you are using when those food,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.790
then you need to use authenticator.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.240
So what you need to do in your phone goto place toe and search for Google authenticator and

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.800
download it and install it on then later point of time,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.810
we will use it.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.740
So please install Google authenticator and then we will proceed.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.180
Photo.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.460
So now I hope you have installed Google Authenticator.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.420
Now we will configure multi factor authentication.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.440
So here you should open your Google authenticator app on your mobile and there you are

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.390
getting an option called scan A barcode with the camera icon So prior to clicking on that

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.610
you have tow trick your Shoki were cord and use Google authenticator from your phone to a

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:42.060
scan This QR code So let's a scan it so I scanned it so it has given me an access court.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.450
So I will type there.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.900
You will also type yours and it will again generate another one.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.330
You have to wait for it so it hasn't deterred another one.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.710
You have to again right that and to set of the multi factor authentication.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:02.840
Now it's sign MMP So we have done successfully what you love my first set up so close you

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.050
so it has generated the serial number.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.240
Now let's go in tow dashboard.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.420
So CEO,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.600
you will find that the green tick mark came Now is a sign off.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.200
You have successfully configured the multi factor authentication.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.670
So let's move for the and we will creator.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.120
I am user.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.620
No,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.450
we will configured and I am user.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.930
Currently,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.390
we're using root account,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.620
so that is a not a good practice to use the root account for your project.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.920
So we need a new user which has access to the respective service for the project in a

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.260
production environment and use every country be created also for your name.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.750
So let's look into the steps water the steps required to create an I am user.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.460
So we need to click over here and click on manage users.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.860
So here you will get an option toe.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.170
Add on user.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.750
So let's click into that.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.440
If you click in tow that,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.280
then you will find that this Pete on here,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.600
you will find their steps.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.080
What are there Steps required to create a new users?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.940
What you need to add user provide a name in the second SW a senior year.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.890
It is showing that permission need to be assigned and then the tag needs to be created for

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.770
that particular user and then it will provide an option to revere it,

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.080
and then the process will complete.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.770
So it is five Mystic process,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.970
toe ad and user.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.260
So here we're seeing that we need to provide a name.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.420
So we are going to provide some name.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.450
I will create one generic names guard Loper,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.390
one clothed of Lapa one.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.050
And here we're going to provide the programmatic access.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:48.200
We're going to use the same user when we're doing the part two off this course as this is

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.320
an eight of Louis automation course.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.390
So we need toe have such kind of factious.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.800
So we need to provide programmatic access and along with it of Louis management console.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.090
No,

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.730
here you have two options.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.540
Either you can auto gendered password or custom passport.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.160
I will be using custom password and I don't want to release it.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.740
So here we need to provide that Once you provided the password,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.040
you need to click on next permissions.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.590
So no,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.130
here you will find that it is giving an option to create a group.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:26.440
So it is really important you have to manage the users with the group so that it is really

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.300
very convenient for user management.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.950
So why it is important.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.500
Suppose if we're working in a project and there are various rules like developer project

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.310
managers.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:43.620
Scrum Master If you're working in a jail project so their various rules and suppose if you

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.150
want toe given access to a particular developer then it would be really easy to add within

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:55.740
a group and he will get all those permissions which is required for developer if you're

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.070
managing through groups,

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.520
so now click on create Group Britain.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.570
So here you will find that it is giving an honor option to provide the name along with the

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.240
policies which is being applied toe this group.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.280
So it is really important to understand this policies.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.850
So first we will provide the name,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.410
I suppose,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:22.870
given to name developers and then understand that what actually these policies are so these

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:28.850
are the policies which is pre defined by AWS for the uses off their services.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:34.420
So this is the way by which you can manage the granularity off the security.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.890
Suppose that if you want to given access,

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.260
I can add mistreated.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.640
So you can.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.470
So it's for administrator.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.150
We're here.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.950
We're getting it.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:49.080
So you want to assign the administrator access toe this group so you can search it and you

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.290
can Derrick Lee assign it,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.730
so we will look into that.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:51.980
What?

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.990
Actually this system administrator access has the click on this button.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.560
So here you will find that it has listed all those services,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.130
which is exist within eight of fluids,

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.480
and we have administrator access.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:05.930
Now.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:11.690
If any user is being assigned toe this developers group and they have full control on these

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.380
services,

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.950
let's move further and click on Create Group.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.220
Now it has created that group and that has administrator access.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.200
You can also provide the same permission,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.570
if any.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.130
A special formation is given weathered user,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.030
and you want to replicate that you can use this option on.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.460
You can also add as the existing policies directly.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.290
For example,

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:40.060
we have seen that Administrator access policy you can directly assigned that policy so this

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.070
particular user or develop open and straight off creating a group.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.480
But group is the best way to handle the permissions,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.470
so let's move further and click on next tag.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.390
This is also very important,

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.720
but optional thing.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.240
Suppose that you have a big project and you want a way for kid the users as per their rules

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.240
.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.030
So this tags option is comes very handy.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.880
For example,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.540
you want to add ruled,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.920
and here you can say that developer.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.350
So if you want toe,

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.200
get the list off.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.740
All go devil oppose within the project so you can use this tag as well.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.910
So here you provide that rules.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.810
Were the rules for this user disease a developer,

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.600
and it will help,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.080
really,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.970
if you were doing some reporting thing and want the list,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.690
How Maney number and who are the develop of walking in the project attacks will really help

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.690
for by for cation the ones you have provided the ruled.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.710
Let's more further and click on next review.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.690
Now we will get an option to create user to click on,

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.530
create user.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.130
You should review it.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.860
If you want to do any changes,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.380
you can easily do the changes.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:53.650
And now African create user to make sure that you should download the sea is we and keep it

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.350
at your secure location.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.460
So,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:55.730
no,

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.850
we done with the user creation process,

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.150
So close it and let's move to the dashboard toe here.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.510
You will find that we have created the individual I am user and we have also created the

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.260
groups over here.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:08.610
Now,

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.010
next we need toe applying.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.850
I am passport policy.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.190
So let's do it.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.530
Click over here,

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.560
Click on manage password policy.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.210
So this password policy is required to set the minimum criteria for setting off the

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.030
passports.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.190
So let's do it.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.180
Click concept password policy to hear you will set the rules where at least one uppercase

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.060
letter while setting off the passport.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.200
So it is really very important so that users will generate the strong password,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.580
the help of these policies.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.480
So we will select this one and we will select this one as well.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.070
Or you want to set all this thing that is also good.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.350
Select this one also and click on save changes.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.390
So we have set up now the password policy.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.800
No going to the dashboard,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.550
and you will find that we have conflict all the security aspect.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.880
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in this session to see in the next session.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.130
Bob,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.010
I take you
