00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Hello,

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:00.910
guys.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.840
Thanks for joining the session in this session.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.120
We're going to look in tow,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.380
Elastic compute cloud.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.220
So this is going to really lab station where we will create the elastic compute cloud from

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.090
eight of Louis management console.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.760
So let's jump into the AWS management console and let's look into the steps,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.260
which is required to create an aide of Louis elastic Compute cloud that is easy to So this

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.250
is our rate of Louis management console to create an easy to you have two options.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.650
Either you can come over here and go toe the easy to from the compute Group.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.610
This is one option.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.630
If you click over here,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.550
it will take you easy to landing page from where you can create the easy to instances.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
Other ways that you can come over here and you can search for is Ito.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.960
And you can select that it will take you to the landing page off.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.860
Easy to go here.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.880
You will get all the details about easy to instances.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.050
So now we are in to landing page and currently it is easy to desperate is being selected.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.860
If we look in tow that than it will give you an information that how many number off

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.070
instances is running?

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.650
How many dedicated host?

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.810
Any volumes attacked with any?

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.550
Keep ear placement groups,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.670
elastic,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.600
a bit snap,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.850
short load balancer,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.640
Any security group or how many number of security group is running so basically will find

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.460
all those information related toe the easy to instance over here.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.910
And then here you will see that create instances,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.580
my greater machine.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.650
So this help.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.230
So do you live in any event is being said,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.870
Do it or not.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.020
And the most important section,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.310
If you look over here,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.200
then you will find that there are so many options given over here,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.360
for instance,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.560
is when when we will create an instant to instance related will information you will get

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.530
over here than the launch templates,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.440
then a sport request we have discussed able to sport request than reserved instances if we

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.050
have any reserved its chances.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.440
So these are the instance pricing options which we have already discussed in our concept

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.520
car No system and then you can get the detail a vote in medium eyes.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.790
We will create some instances with help off image on Machinea majors,

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.580
who am.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.780
Am I full form then this is the information related to security group Elastic A piece

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.700
placement groups.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.560
Keep your load,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.280
balancer.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.980
Any load balancer than launch conflagrations.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.140
All these detail you will get over here.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.550
So let's now create.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.170
And easy to instance Soto create an easy to instant The steps Are this one forced?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.160
You need to click on launch instances,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.470
so it will take you to the beach.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.510
So here you will get an options to select the media's on which this instance is going to be

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.150
raised upon.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.280
So,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.250
for example,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.910
over here we're getting that Amillia Only NATO e m I.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.400
And all those details.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.190
So But we will be interested in free two year only.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.540
So we need toe check.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.150
Mark this one for this lab.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.470
So we're getting such option now we need to select the image on the next to a might.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.780
So you need to just select this one toe a my full form,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.850
which I already mentioned that image on Machinea meat.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.740
So that means whenever we're launching an easy to instant,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.580
that easy to instant is based on this year.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.320
Might who here?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.480
Now you have to recollect the theory part,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.900
we have discussed about where 80 or instance type like general purpose computer optimized

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.780
memory optimized stories optimized all these thing you will get over here.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.830
So it has been categorized also.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.530
So we have discussed about general purpose we have discussed about com computer up to my

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.340
some of the general purpose not have level into the free tea and whichever is mentioned

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.980
over here.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.240
So the one lady to is every level for free t it.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.090
So we have only used this one.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.390
We want to use other one than it is chargeable as per the on demand pricing which we have

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.130
discussed in our once obsession to hear you are getting the detail that were the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.730
conflagration it should contain.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.790
It has one virtual CPU and 2.5 gigahertz until the own family keep you on.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.090
We have one degree off memory and it has a devious,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.420
which we were going to discuss about the weirs in the later part of the courts.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.290
That is a stands for elastic block a story.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.110
So this is the configuration for this particularly easy to instant.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.410
Now proceed further and click on next and we will configure the instance.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.860
Details.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.070
So here we're getting so many options,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.470
like number off instance.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.780
The number of instance we're going to create one.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.200
If you have any option for your sport instances praising option you want to apply,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.550
then you can select this one.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.610
It will give you the option to select that price.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.260
You need to provide the maximum price off that.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.510
So this is the current price which is going on.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.670
So you need to specify your current press than it will relocated to you.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.920
So we don't require no.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.810
In this level,

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.300
it has provided the Defour VPC network connections.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.900
So we're going to discuss later part of this course and here you will find that submit

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.610
references.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.440
So currently we're going to stick with the default sub net,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.000
which is being provided over here.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.660
That is no preferences here.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.300
You can assign the public i p so we're going toe stick with water were 34 adoption,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.470
which is being selected.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.710
Then you can choose the placement group as well.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.410
Then there is a capacity reservation which we have discussed earlier.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.930
If any of the I am rule is being created in which you want to associate with this easy to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.390
instant.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.170
You can associate that I am roll so we don't have yet and said Don't behavior you can

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.970
select the said Don't be a weird whenever this is going to be so don't so whether you want

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.540
to dominate it so you can choose the dominate as well so that it gets dominated and you're

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.420
easy to his chance Guard deleted.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.800
It has also pro prison where you can check this protect against accidental domination.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.080
So,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.190
in case if anybody argue terminating the instance by mistake,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.750
such option will help you That will remind you that this instance is not supposed to be

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.450
deleted.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.480
Then there is an option for tendency.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.470
So there is an option for elastic inference ing.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.490
So this is useful.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.650
Whenever you were working on the deep learning programming or deep learning algorithm,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.560
So this is really very helpful.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.810
So there is another option you will find over here that true t two and t three unlimited.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.630
So this is going to be a chargeable.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.980
So for this session,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.290
known said like this one,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.910
then we have user data.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.900
So in this you can provide the Buddhist trip supposed that if we want to configure your

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.120
easy to instant and it is very useful.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.050
For example,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.400
I suppose that if we want to install and civil after the creation off you see too so you

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.260
can read those a script over here on it will install than simple package within this easy

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.020
to instant.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.810
So such kind of Buddhist trapping thing you can provide over here.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.390
Now proceed further and click on next at the storage.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.360
So here you will get an option to add this story.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.960
So basically it has provided that root ball which is being associated with this easy to

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.440
instant.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.250
So these volumes are the volume where operating system has been in start rude volume.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.500
One interesting thing you confined that you can't encrypt this route volume.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.780
But if you add another new volume,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.610
then you will find that it gives you an option to encrypted.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.310
You just need to select that it will do the encryption for you.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.000
It is really helpful for those security purposes.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.280
We're going to stick with root volume on legal.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.440
We can remove that these manual steps are really very important to understand the details

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.890
about the object as it is really very easy to do the automation on any subject or say on

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.730
any object.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.810
If you know about the details off that particular object with that,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.710
the reason rightto going into automation off eight of Louis I wanted toe give the part one

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.520
where I can.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.660
So the manual,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.750
the strips home annually we are going to create all these object with the help off aid of

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.350
Louis Management console.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.060
So now proceed further and click on next Act act.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.200
So this is very important to hear we can associate sometimes with this easy to instance,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.380
so that it is easy toe group the instances,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.270
for example,

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.200
right here so that if we want to associate this easy tune stand as a death machine so you

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.110
can rated development or the machine,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.400
you can add another one.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.240
Suppose that if we wanted to keep it with other groups like operating system,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.480
so you can add it.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.230
So what kind of operating system it has?

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:25.550
So you suppose you want to get the detail about all those ec2 instances which is and which

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.850
is having a lean X operating system,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.980
how you can do it?

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.320
We will rate it like that operating system.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.810
Lee Necks,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:31.990
who?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.100
We have associate ID two tags over here.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:41.180
So it would be really easy toe group the machines with the help of banks machines.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.890
Here I am refering that easy to instances now proceed folder and click on Next Configure

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.850
Security Group.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.430
So here we will get a new Tom called Security Group,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.260
so we're going to discuss the World Security Group in detail.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.630
But for a time being just considered,

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.700
that security group is nothing but a Fire World rules,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:07.550
which is associated with easy to instances that allow or disallow to your easy to instance

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.550
.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.250
So let me provide that detail.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:14.300
So I have given the detail like Security Group name is it of Louis automation and

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.410
description is the same.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:20.060
So here we need toe provide the how we're going to connect with with this.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.990
Easy to instance,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.100
we we must enable there's a such port.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.600
So for that on reason,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.250
we need to select either from which i p we're going toe connect to the sea.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.390
Easy to instance,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.290
for a time being,

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.450

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.590
So for that we need toe go back to easy to instance and grab the public.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.580
I p from here,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.280
we'll just copy it.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.870

which we have generated from B and filed.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.410
So this file we have generated,

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.340
we will grab it,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.770
