00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870
Hello guys.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.780
Welcome to another session in this session.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.280
We're going to look into lab for VPC.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.050
Whatever we have discussed in our theory section,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.240
we are going toe work with VPC where we will look into default bpc along with known default

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.050
vpc That is custom virtual private cloud.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.440
So let's jumps in tow it of Louis management concern and gets our hands dirty.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.640
So,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.920
guys,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.230
we're into AWS management console.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.580
No,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.600
we will move further and go toe the PC guestbook going to the U P zero as rude.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.090
We have two options.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.440
What we need to do.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.690
We need to come here and click on services diary pretty so you can go it from you or you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.750
can sort you and you will find that networking and content delivery or click on re busy.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.220
The ones who click on we proceed will take you to the CPC dashboard.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.480
So in this dashboard you will find that we have one vpc six sub nets,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.720
one room table,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.250
one security group,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.130
one network,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.720
A seals.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.180
So these competent we have already discussed.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.460
So you must be wondering that we haven't created any kind of repeat yet.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.460
But why do we take this over here.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.220
So here,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.540
the first point to remember.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.990
Come.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.010
So what happened that whenever we're creating an AWS account on that time AWS creator Ah

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.390
vpc in each regions that I will show you And this three pc is the forgery pretty so it

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.040
Let's look into that Once you go inside that then you will find Over here there is a flag

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.720
mentioned the full vpc Yes,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.490
So that means it is a deformed bpt.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.130
But when we create all custom vpc then you will find that this flag is said to be no Now we

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.390
will move to the other region and we will look into that Is there any re PC is also being

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.380
created while creating off readable is account so we can go to any of the reason.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.480
For example,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.250
US West,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.850
North California we will go there.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.940
Then we will find that there is another BPC is also being created while creating the AWS

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.430
account.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.720
So it has created a very busy in each reason.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.290
See,

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.980
the number is a little different.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.060
You PC iPhone 59 cdd e three eat.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.370
So just remember this number and what was the number we were having in North Virginia.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.270
I will show you.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.960
Come here.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.310
Then you will find that this number is different.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.790
So here you will find that 73 V for everyone.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.280
So now,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.610
moving toe the dashboard again and you will find that it has six suddenly.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.870
Why?

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.530
Because it has this reason North Virginia reason had sex.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.720
Several abilities on that.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.310
There is an intense six sub net.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.340
If you go us East Ohio so here you will find that it has three sub minutes because it has

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.770
three of liabilities will know we will move further and again.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.980
We will went back toe not Virginia reason.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.150
And we will go inside the we pity.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.720
So we're into the VPC and we can go inside it and we will tag it so you can give a name so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.050
that it would be easy to recognize that you can give it to a name before we proceed.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.340
It is really a good practice to provide the tagging,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.850
Jordan.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.610
No,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.860
we will go to the dashboard and here you will find that we have sub nets and why it is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.030
being click submit.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.150
Because this region has six.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.920
Several abilities.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.260
What is also good practice?

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.810
Tow tank.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.830
The sudden it's as well if you want to do that.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.220
So it would be really easy to get to know what what the subject is and from where it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.690
belongs.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.470
Toe you will tag it as well.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.590
Commune.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.030
Tag it.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.870
Give it to name.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.640
Let easy one of net is too easy.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.190
Three.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.330
So we can tag it like this way Tagging is really very helpful.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.930
When we want to troubleshoot these sub nets,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.660
you can find that it is being associated with same re PC.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.860
So now here you will find the details have.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.750
Although some next year you will get their description that what is the subject?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.970
I d What is the state which we proceed is being associated with So here you are getting a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.990
number that is 4091 So you must be wondering how this number is being given to Let's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.560
discuss about some of the man.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.950
If you're looking toe i p before cider this one,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.950
then you will find that it has given twenties last 20 and it has total number off 42 seats

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.950
.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.080
So that means 30 to minus 20 we're having to elope,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.330
Know,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.250
understand the man.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.870
That means we're having in hand to a little bit.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.050
On the basis off the hand we can generate the I p and system.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.030
So now I will open a calculator.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.800
So if we will find that,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.110
too,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:46.870
to the power off 12 that will give us a number 4096 But here we're getting 4091 looking toe

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.040
that 4091 Why is it so?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.490
Because five addresses which either Lewis will not provide,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.940
and they will keep it for their uses.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.500
So we can't use it.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.020
The talk for and the last one and the top for So you should remember that the top four

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.410
imagine will keep it,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.790
and the last one imagine will keep it.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.780
Between that,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.120
you can use anyone so that the reason for 096 minus that fiver addresses the top for and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.580
the last one will return a 4091 So that the reason you are getting a P before 409 months,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.450
That means these number off I P addresses you can locate within this sub may.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.630
Well,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.530
just remember that and the other information you will find over here is that flow locks

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.490
which we have discussed earlier through people fruit people,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.050
information which is being associated with this of net nickel tagged the tax which we have

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.370
created over here it is being reflected and sharing is the summit is being shared anywhere

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.370
.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.580
So it is not given the information because we haven't shared it for no moving for though we

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.640
will discuss about root people's jumped into the roof table.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.180
So here you will find that this is a root people which is marked there.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.740
Yes,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.530
in the main.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.400
That means it is a main route table.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.760
If you remember that we have discussed about main route table in our theory section,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.840
You can else attack the round table over here with the name core main table en route with.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.420
And now if you remember this diagram,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.670
then you will come to know that we have in tree over here,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:27.580
which is being mentioned like Ken Burns 0.0 dot zero last 16 that is representing the local

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.580
.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.460
So where this entry happened,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.950
let's look into that.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.280
Then there is a tab called route.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.730
If you were looking toe that.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.450
Then you will find that we have an entry over here.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.740
Like here We're getting one.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.860
Put 1 $72.31 dollars 0.0 slats 16 and that is representing the local.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.590
This route table has an also entry off Internet gateway.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.200
So you must be remembering the authorization.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.350
That way we use the round table so it will be used to rule the traffic.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.200
And this route table is associated with the implied route and router can be used to grow

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.630
the traffic with the help of this round table.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.470
So by default you will find that it has to intrigue.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.170
So the first entries,

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.150
this one's a word.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.090
This entry mean,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.650
waited,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.400
representing as local because if any,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.090
off the traffic which is coming within this range,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.960
this is a side of Loch Range which you will get over here.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.900
If you will go into the VPC dashboard within the VPC,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.430
then you will find we have a side of loch range,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.090
the same range which is existing within the root table.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.050
So if we're getting the traffic within this range,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.350
that means that is belongs to the local.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.490
This is what this entry means so basically this entries for the local within the seven And

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.600
now we were moving further than we were looking toward this entries Isidore Blue for entry

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.600
.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.930
That means so it is applicable.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.050
All die pays which is coming from outside Apart from the sub NATO,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.870
that means forced entry for local within the BBC and second entry for outside the VPC.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.650
So you must be remembering We have discussed about Internet Gateway in our theory section

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.720
where we have discussed about whenever any back it is coming from outside of the VPC,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.690
it must come through Internet gateway and Internet gateways associated with the implied

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.730
rotor and implied order disassociated with root table where we can check that where this

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.670
packet should go.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.330
One important thing which I wanted to show over here.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.610
Whenever we're going in tow,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:26.830
they didn't You will find you don't have ah probe isn't toe leader before local but you

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:32.140
have an option to delete the Internet gateway and this entry you confined in all the round

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.730
table within the week BC,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.880
Whether it is a photo able or whether it is a custom road table,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.550
the local interests would be associative within the repeat sea route table irrespective of

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.880
type,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.780
whether it to the main road table or a custom wrote table,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:53.750
this entry will exist way because it contains the I P address ranges within the CPC No

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.570
moving photo.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.320
You can check the subject associates and within the Southern attests a season taboo.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.910
Here you will find it has six of minute association over here.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.070
So now moving back to repeated Daschle?

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.320
No,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.850
Here we have understand in this lab that default VPC came to know about what happens when

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.070
we create an account with a w it than eight of fluids.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.730
By default create three PC in per reason.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.920
We have also discuss about subjects We have also discuss about truth table.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:26.430
So here are my stopping in the next session we will do the lab to create the customary PC

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.750
in the customary pretty where we will create the sub nets through table Internet,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:36.950
get with security group network a sales by our own and then we will associate those

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.670
component with the VPC.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.320
So this is what I want to discuss with you in decisions in the next session.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:42.720
Till then,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:42.990
Bob,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.640
I take care
