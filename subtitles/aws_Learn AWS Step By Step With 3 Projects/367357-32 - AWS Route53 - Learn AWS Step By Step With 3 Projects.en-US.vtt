00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.370
Hello,

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.630
guys.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.530
Thanks for joining the session in this session.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.950
We're going to look in tow eight of fluid through 50 through service.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.060
So let's understand that why we use Route 53 or say what is the purpose of Route 53 within

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.690
eight of Louis ecosystem?

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.920
So,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.530
basically,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.490
Emily on Route 53 is a highly every level and s callable domain name system that is DNS Web

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.070
service.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.000
Route 53 can be used to perform mainly three functions that first domain registration

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.480
Second dean is rooting.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.470
Authorities held checking off a job Lewis Resources,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.310
so let's discuss about all these three points in more detail.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.630
So let's discuss it for domain registration,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.630
as we all know,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.730
that every website needs the name and that name should be registered so that people can

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.430
access it.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.890
So here,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.680
the first function or fruit with 23 comes into picture.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.180
That is domain registration.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.760
You can register your domain using Route 53 so,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.070
no,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.840
let's understand that how domain registration works.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.900
Suppose that you want to create a website called the Blood of Low Dot I want to learn A W's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.020
auto making dot com can control that whether the name is every level or not.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.040
In case if it is not every level,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.020
then you have to select another name.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.440
Once you found on the name is available,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.790
then you can registered the domain name withdrew 53.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.410
While doing the registration,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.500
you should provide the name and your contact details.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.610
When we registered the domain withdrew 53 and what it does,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
it creates a host schedule that has the same name as our domain,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.520
and then it will assign a set of four names.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.230
So it was toe the hosted zone.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.120
Suppose someone uses a browser to accept our website that is w w dot I want to loan it.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.150
W it's automation.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.590
Not then these names or was till the browser where to find the resources like webs over or

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.930
an average honest three bucket and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the Web.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.880
In the northward,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.190
it gets the name servers from the host regional and adds them toe the domain,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.480
and at the end of the registration process,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.940
it sends information to the register for the domain here.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.350
The registrar's Amazon Register,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.320
incorporated now afterwards reached US cents our information toe.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.860
The registry for the Domain Registry is a company that sells domain registration for one or

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.750
more top level domains such as DOT com.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.900
So here now the registries toes the information about our doom in in their own database and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.150
also store some off the information in the public.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.370
Who is database.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.580
So,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.880
no,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.650
let's jump into the AWS management console where I will show you from where you can

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.850
register your domain.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.010
So let's jump into AWS management console.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.830
So we're in tow eight of Louis Management Concert Toe Goto the Route 53.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.590
You need to go to the network and content delivery,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.750
and here you can find that route 53 Click on it.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
So we're in tow route with 23 console,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.810
and here you will find these full activity can perform.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.000
So mainly we're interested in tow domain registration.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.250
So we need to click on good to starter now,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.640
once you click,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.610
couldn't get the starter.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.960
No.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.400
So you will find that were in tow register domains,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.320
and here you can click on register domain,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.870
and then here you need to check that whether the domain is available or not.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.050
For example,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.320
I want toe greater name.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.070
I want toe automation,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.880
something like that.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.080
Check the availability.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.180
It will check that so it is available now,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.180
but it will cost you $12.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.880
So we're not proceeding from here.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.850
So just I wanted to show you that from where you can check the domain name.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.090
Once you have decided the name,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.460
then you can proceed photo at toe the card so that domain is registered to you.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.210
Moving for the cancel it.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.910
Let's go back to the discussion and in earnest earned under the function that is Dennis

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.350
routing.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.790
So no,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.860
let's understand that.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.340
However,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.700
John Drew 53 routes traffic toe the domain.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.360
So what's happened that a user opens off Web browser and enters the website address?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.460
The request for website is routed toe ordinance,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.950
result for which is typically managed by the Internet service provider.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.670
Then the DNS resulted for the Internet.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.760
Service providers forwards the request for the requested website for the in its route names

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.180
over.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.040
Then there.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.440
Deena's result will forward the request for our requested website again,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.540
but this time toe one off the deal.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.570
The names of worse for dot com domains in this example the names of all for dot com domain

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.830
response to the request with the names off the four route 53 names over that are associated

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.360
with the requested website Domain Dinner.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.300
The Step five.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.190
The Deena's result would choose a Route 53 names over and forwards the request for

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.390
requested website names over.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.660
In this example,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.680
it will request for www example dot com.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.720
Toe the names over the Step six.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.140
The Route 53 names over looks in the examples or compost Red Zone for the doublet of Ludo

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.560
example dot com record and get the associative value.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.380
That is I p.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.140
Address for us,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.950
a Web server,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.980
and it returns the I P address toe.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.050
The DNS result will know where the Step seven Dina sizzle will finally has die.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.880
Pierre dressed that the user needs the result returns that well toe the Web browser and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.750
then afterwards,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.010
at a strip,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.430
ate the Web.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.660
Rosa Sense of request for the requested website.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.660
In this example,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.750
factors delude of Ladakh example dot com.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.730
So the i P address that it got from the dean result for and this is where the our country

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.510
is reside,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.320
which is a Web so over running on Amazon,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.510
easy to instance,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.200
or might be an image honest three bucket that it's configured as a website and point.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.170
And that last Step nine,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.820
the Web Slovo who turns the weapons that is requested for.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.150
And in this example,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.610
we had using the blood of loot example dot com that displays the webpage within the browser

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.610
.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.870
So this is how am 100 53 routes traffic to the domain now moving for the Let's discuss

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.090
about third function off Route 53 that is health.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.860
Check off the aid of Louis Resources.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.680
So let's jump into a diagram and then we will discuss a 1,000,000 route preparatory helps.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.770
Ex Function is one of the function of Route 53 that we can use to monitor the health off

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.390
our aid of Louis Resources.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:30.060
We can use Route 53 to monitor Web server and email servers with the help of Route 53 cloud

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.910
what we can design a full blown monitoring system in place for our it of Louis resources.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.840
Both of the services can help us to design a monitoring application where,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.110
at any point of time,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.060
any of the resources is going down that Route 53 will notify the Cloudwatch and Cloud would

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.760
send a notification toe the users with the help of cloud notification service.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.520
So that means three services comes into picture.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.860
One is the Route 53.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.090
Another one is cloudwatch that we will use for alarm and the those over,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.800
says VW Assassin,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.690
a service that a simple notification service that is mainly used that is mainly used to

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.950
send a notification.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.350
To resent the system,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.260
you need to create a health check and that specify values that define how you want the

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.400
health check toe work.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.210
So in this definition process,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.950
you need to define the endpoint,

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.950
which you want that Route 53 should monitor.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.970
You can also specify the protocol that you want.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.990
Imagine Route 53 to use toe for home the check on STP STP Assorted sippy.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:38.910
You need to also specifying that how frequently Route 53 to send a request to the end point

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.630
This process of definition,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:46.170
it's called requesting tobel unique to also specify that how many consecutive times the

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:52.370
endpoint must fail to respond to request before Route 53 Considerate on healthy and the

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.350
definition for this process is called failure Trestle definition.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.600
We're configuring the Route 53.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.180
We have an option for notification.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:07.590
That is how we want to notify when Route 53 detects that the endpoint is unhealthy.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.290
And when we do configuration for notification,

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.850
Route 53 automatically search the cloudwatch alarm cloudwatch uses.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:23.650
Imagine simple notification service that is essence to notify users that an endpoint is

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.350
unhealthy.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.770
So this is how it of Louis Route 53.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.440
Soviets checks the health off our AWS resources.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.180
So no,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.110
let's look what we have learned so far.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.910
So in this session we have launched a revolt Route 53 services.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.370
What is the functions of Route 53?

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.790
We have gone through domain registration process,

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.450
and we have seen that hardiness rooting works.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:52.060
And at last we have seen that how well taking process or the function off Road 53 that is

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.350
held checking is working.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.360
And this is what I want you to discuss in decision seeing the nexus.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.890
Until then,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.140
Bob,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.680
I take you
