00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Hello,

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.770
guys.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.080
Thanks for joining decision.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.760
In this session,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.280
we're going to do laugh or security groups.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.320
So let him win Toe either blew its management console.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.830
But pride toe that Let's understand that what we are going to do in this land So first we

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.360
will create a security group and then we will create an easy two instance.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.770
And while creating the easy to instance,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.120
we will use that custom security group in our easy to creation.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.910
Then we will rate some security group rules to allow and disallow toe access the easy to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.430
instant.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.260
We will also look into inbound and outbound Soto allowing boned where we can write and to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.300
allow out Born where we can write,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.590
we will look into that All these things are coming into our lab.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.150
So no,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.200
let's jump into the it of Louis management console.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.770
So here we are into it of Louis management console.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.580
Now,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.750
first we will goingto easy to dashboard.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.270
So you remember how do we are going there?

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.470
So we need to use the search box.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.030
We can type it.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.670
So this is the preferred way.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.210
So once you find it,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.480
you just click over there So it will take you to the easy to management console.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.050
And here you will get the dashboard.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.100
So currently we have two security group.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.020
Now what we will do,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.460
we will create a security group over here.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.330
So we are in tow Security group.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.300
And here we will create a security group cord.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.210
We will give a name eight of Louis Security group them,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.800
or we will give one name,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.920
and then we can add a rules.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.470
So see,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.960
here we were discussing about inbound and outbound toe.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.030
Allow the poor toe access this easy to instance and whichever easy to instance which is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.760
actually associating with this security group,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.710
they can access it.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.650
We will add the security group rules later.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.600
For a time being just created.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.900
Click on Create weapon.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.580
So it will create on security groups here.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.020
It has created it of Louis,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.700
as did Emma.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.930
So now the next step,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.390
what we will do we will launch an easy two instance and associate the security group.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.620
We will come over here now we will click on launch instance.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.820
So here we need to select the three tier only we will get this option.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.750
Now we will click on Select to choose the General Proper.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.490
And now here contribute instance this details you click over here now,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.100
in the configure instance section that means this section we will keep the thing as is as

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.420
we don't need to provide.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.070
And we don't need to change anything over here.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.590
So we will go with 34 adoption and we will click on our the story.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.610
Now here we need to again choose the default option and click on add Thanks.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.740
So you can add Tank.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.680
So again we can provide some tag over here.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.090
But wait,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.460
the name,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.540
it is not necessary.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.650
But you can give it now we can get an option to configure security group.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.230
So here we need to use the security group.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.740
We need to select over here,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.840
select an existing security group,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.340
and we can use that eight of Louis,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.160
as did Emma.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.470
Now we will write the security group rules later for a timing,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.490
we will review it review and long to see your We're getting a warning.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.230
So this warning is telling that you are not able to connect with the CC two instance which

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.040
you're creating because you haven't opened.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.780
That means you haven't given a rule security group rules,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.210
so that doesn't have involved rules.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.670
Where we are opening the port 22 poor 22 is basically used for as such connection.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.720
Asus it connection is seem like rdp connection off Windows.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.900
That means you can remotely access the easy to instance.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.430
So we will continue it because we know that we haven't set up any kind off security group

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.080
rules that were there in our security group.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.990
So that's fine.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.200
Click on continue.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.940
Know we need to click on launch.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.680
So here we need to generate the new keep here so that we will connect.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.860
So this easy to.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.730
So here we will given name and the names would be eight of Louis.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.840
Demo is de demo key.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.230
So you need to download it and we will use the party connection.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.640
If you're working with the next system than you don't required Connecticut,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.150
we do that.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.880
But if you are working with the window system,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.580
then you need 40 42 to connect to the clinic system.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.960
So because we have created a leaning system,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.250
the CC two instances Olynyk systems where you need to use must have a party connection to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.410
connect with the neck system from Windows Machine to download it,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.840
download,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.130
keep here and say that we will use it later.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.950
And now we will click on launch instances.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.970
So it is getting created.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.010
You go here and you will check it to say year.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.560
It is still working.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.880
It is impending a state.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.410
So now it is being created.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.410
So no,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.730
we will goto the security group and we will look into the inborn rules.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.250
So let's look into that.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.470
If you select that,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.350
you will find over here that there is no inborn rules,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.720
so what it means.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.760
So that means this security group is associated with the easy to instance which we have

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.620
created now.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.190
So suppose that if you want toe connect from party,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.840
then it will not connect.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.200
Why?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.440
Because our inborn rule is not being said.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.440
So let's trey toe open first 40 kitchen so that we can generate the people kicky that is

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.410
private key from the Pam file,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.130
which we have downloaded at the time off Creation off easy to instance.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.100
So let's open it.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.550
So now we need to Lord Ducky.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.920
So here you need to select all files.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.980
We need to select this Pam Fine.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.990
Which we have created for AWS as ge Demo key to select it.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.340
Open it on.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.080
It has given us the private key.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.960
So we will save this private key?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.320
Yes.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.350
And we will give a name it of Louis SG and save it.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.370
So now we will open the party and try to connect with easy to instance.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.750
So now we have opened the parties after,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.070
So what we need to do we need to specify the i P and the user to the user is easy to iPhone

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.530
users.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.450
Now we need to grab the I p public I p off Easy to instance so to do that,

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.190
we need to come back with easy to desperate.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.950
And here here we need toe select the instances from the instances we need to grab this I p

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.820
before public.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.040
I pick opiate once you cooperated.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.750
Then again open the party software and here you need to paste it.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:29.960
No CEO were telling that goto this i p with this user and connected at port 22.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.220
But this poor poor 22 is not opened in the s D group in the inbound rules,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.680
which I haven't returning it.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.130
So what will happen that even though you have generated the key map it first.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.690
So we will browse it even though you have mapped it.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.350
But still it will not work.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.790
Why?

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.950
Because in bone rule is not being allowed yet.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.600
Okay,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.370
so first we will save it.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.930
Come here.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.050
And here we will say.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.230
Well,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.350
give give it a name.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.060
Eight of Louis de Demo.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.970
Save it.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.750
Once done.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.750
Now click on open.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.330
So what will be the output?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.560
What do you think exactly Will not connect.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.520
So it is trying.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.480
But the port is not open there.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.110
So that the reason it is keep on trying.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.100
Keep on trying.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.240
After some try,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.120
it will return the era of CEO after some time it through network interconnection.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.850
Time out.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.760
Now what we will do,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.680
we will write a security group rule for inbound or incoming traffic.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.230
Okay,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.250
let's do it.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.850
Click on.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.240
OK,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.200
that's okay.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.360
You go away and now we will go here.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.240
We need toe.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.260
Come here into the network section.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.110
So here,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.360
sick security groups.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.700
And then we will say like the as did m o and in the end,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.850
it so here project.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.440
So here we need to click on it.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:50.890
It turned.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.720
We need to with specify the A sausage.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.020
And we need to open the port 22 the source I'm going to use anywhere.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.700
I'm opening for everywhere to select it.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.620
So any off the I p can access this instance for timing.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.910
I'm keeping it like so have added it saved.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.650
Now I have a reader rule.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.170
So this rule is being added.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.040
So now again opened the party software and what we will do,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.150
we will try toe connect again.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.170
Let's do it.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.640
So here we have already created its Oh Lord it So now try to access it.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.210
See you.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.450
It got connected.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.880
The committee.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.260
Why?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.900
Because we have allowed the ESA such panic.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:40.660
So this is war Security group rules it work as a firewall so that you can allow or disallow

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.540
at any time.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.970
So by default from a security group,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.480
prospective are born.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.150
All the traffic which is going out from the easy to is being allowed.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.400
So all traffic is being allowed from easy to instance.
