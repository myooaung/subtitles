00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Hello,

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.860
guys.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.180
Welcome to the course loan aid of Lewis's step by step.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.560
This is the first course in aid of Louis Automation cities.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.530
So let's look into the topic.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.800
What are the topics which we are going to cover in this source?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.930
This course is Redick with it for the automation within eight of Louis as we are going to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.650
perform all those exercises manually,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.960
because if you do the things manually,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.060
you can easily right any automation,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.050
irrespective of what you want to automate.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.300
So let's look into the topic now,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.190
so we will start our journey.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.390
But I step one overview and set up in this a step we will learn about what is cloud

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.940
computing and what was there prior toe,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.290
either.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.550
Bluest how things was working right?

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.450
Weight of Louis.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.270
And what was the pain area?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.640
Right?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.410
Weight of Louis.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.470
Then we will look into how aws globally it's credited their infrastructure and how they're

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.420
organizing their infrastructure and what they're called in aid of Louis context like AWS

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.980
regions availability zone as location.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.000
So all these things we will learn once you comfortable with that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.270
Then we will look in tow.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.040
The steps to set up the AWS free to your account as it is required to work with eight of

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.630
Louis management console.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.410
Once we finished their Step one,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.380
we will proceed toe there Steptoe,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.620
where we will learn about eight of Louis ecosystem with this cause.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.670
My attempt is toe teach you everything afraid of Louis in a step by step manner so that you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.860
can relate each concepts logically and you can use that service says accordingly.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.720
No moving further.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.060
Oh,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.670
in the Steptoe belong about ecosystem,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.700
afraid of Louis.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.650
So in this aspect we will understand that what is AWS management console and how you were

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.220
going to use it when you use any of the services of VWs and AWS charges people usage.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.020
But with three tier account,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.330
you will be getting some our so free using off many services.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.690
Toto,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.110
drag that usage.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.900
We will set up free tier usage billing alarm in the same escape with will.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.870
I also understand identity access management,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.750
which is one of the core important topic in terms of security.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.300
Well,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.970
we will learn how to manage the security off.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.750
Any resource is off AWS with the help of identity access management now moving for the in

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.540
the step three.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.840
We will learn about compute option,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.450
where we will learn about elastic compute cloud that is mainly related toe virtual servers

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.450
.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.900
In this,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.830
a step alone about how many times off compute That is what you also was offered by Aid of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.350
Louis.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.260
Along with that,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.490
we will also use free two year offered virtual sober that is D to Waco or,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.720
say,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.350
free tier compute option that this d to micro.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.490
So in this aspect,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.150
we will learn,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.610
forced the concept.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.020
And then we will do the lab so that you are in a comfortable position to understand what is

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.750
easy to.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.380
Once you have understanding about compute,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.680
we will move further and looking toe block a stories that is our step for here we will look

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.210
in tow.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.720
Devious.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.970
That is elastic blocker stories that is stories service offering off it of Louis blockers

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.650
told that used to hold the wineries off operating system.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.650
So here also,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.820
we will learn about the concepts off elastic blocking stories that is devious,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.630
and then we will do lab,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.900
And once we comfortable with devious elastic blocker stories,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.800
then we will move for the investor.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.210
Five.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.870
We will learn about Imogen Machinea made here.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.560
We will learn about how to create Imagine machine image if we had using easy to instance

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.340
and made that.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.660
Is it,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.430
for instance,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.300
as a webs over and you want to replicate the same configuration in another 20 easy to

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.010
instance toe,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.590
make them as a Web server.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.740
So this is Step will give you idea how to convert an easy to configuration in tow.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.050
Imagine machine image now moving for,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.750
though you will also do a small project where you will create an easy two instance and make

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.150
it as a Web server.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.830
My intention with the schools is that you will do as much as lab while learning the aid of

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.040
Louis so that you will get more hands on experience along with theoretical knowledge.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.720
Once you complete the Project one,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.930
we will move further on Lord in a vote bootstrapping process in the Step six.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.880
In this aspect,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.420
we will Buddhist wrapped the project one in a step six.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.820
If you confuse the world Buddhist tripping word.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.960
So Buddha stripping is nothing but a mechanism by which you can or to make the repetitive

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.590
task using his script.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.510
And once you understand bootstrapping,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.570
we will proceed Photo at step seven steps seven is very important to understand the aid of

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.790
Louis infrastructure.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.980
So here we were going to learn about what?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.570
Your private cloud in depth and where I have discussed all the nuts and bolts off virtual

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.320
private cloud that is re PC.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.810
So we're going to discuss all these topics in virtual private Cloud section and where we

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.040
will do a lab as well so that you can easily understand the concept once you're comfortable

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.590
with what your private cloud,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.560
we will proceed for those and we will do the project to where we will design the custom

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.910
repeat,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.790
see with the knowledge which we have required at a step seven once you completely the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.300
project.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.890
So then we will proceed for the and where we will learn about aws elastic load balancing.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.020
So here also,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.330
we will learn about the concepts and we will do the lab.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.030
Once you understand about hell,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.910
we that is elastic load balancing.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.320
We will proceed for the at the step nine on.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.530
We were going to learn about a double with one of the mostly you service that is simple

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.550
story service,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.390
and here also we will understand the concept.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.800
And then we will do the lab,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.990
though,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.120
that you can get the complete knowledge about as three.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.790
That is simple story service off eight of Louis After learning as three,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.790
we will proceed for,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.190
though,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.350
and we will learn about aws cloudwatch that is mainly used for monitoring,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.050
monitoring off the resource,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.570
you said.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.430
So we belong about that.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.130
Once we learn about cloudwatch,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.570
we will proceed for the right to step 11 and we will learn about how to improve the

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.150
performance off your application,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.380
which you are hosting within either of Lewis with the help of Content delivery network that

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.000
a CD in that is known as cloudfront in aid of Louis infrastructure.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.640
So in this aspect we are also going to learn about the concept,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.820
and we will do the lab on it so that you will be in a comfortable position to understand

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.990
the entire nitty gritty off content delivery network off AWS tactics cloudfront.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.070
Then we will proceed further and we will look into another AWS services that is Route 53 we

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.000
will learn about the usage off route 53 in detail.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.740
I want to understand that.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.350
Then we will proceed further at the Step 13 where we will look into another one of the most

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.880
reused Manus services.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.820
That is aws rds.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.980
That is relational database service off either of Louis.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.140
Here we will learn about the concepts off our ideas,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.640
how the are idiots instances being created and how you will create a DB engine within that

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.350
instance.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.570
And once engine is being created,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.430
how we're going to access it through client tools and at last,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.810
how we will delete that db instance.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.400
So all these things we will learn within this step 13 and once we're comfortable with

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.990
everything,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.740
we will do a final project where we will design something meaningful.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.510
In this project,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.650
we will design Ah,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.640
high availability eight of Louis in France.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.770
In this project,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.090
you will come to know about or to a scaling concept you will also see I was so we're coming

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.500
back to an existence.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.750
If it is going down in this project,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.320
that is really going to be a very fun exercise.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.120
And that knowledge you cannot play anywhere in your practical day to day activity wherever

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.430
you're designing Ojai every level infrastructure with the need of Louis.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.060
So all these things are coming in our upcoming session in this course while you are waiting

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.900
for Let's jump into the court.
