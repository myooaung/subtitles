00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
Hello,

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:00.790
guys.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.680
Thanks for joining the station in this session.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.110
We're going to look into elastic blockers to read,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.160
so let's jumps into the discussion.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.550
So in the last session,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.450
we have discussed about elastic cloud compute toe in decision we're going to discuss about

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.840
elastic block storage.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.380
So the topics which we're going to cover is the areas serious volume snapshot.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.290
And we can also look in tow that how toe who it is,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.800
Think with the aid of Louis management console.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.860
But prior to going into in depth off TVs.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.190
So I wanted to show you one diagram so that you can understand the different type of for

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.210
storage within it of Louis.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000
So let's jump into the diagram.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.170
So in this diagram,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.540
you're finding that there were 80 off or so different type Oprah story within either bluest

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.520
like a majority bees,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.810
that is a Stearns for elastic blocks,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.520
tourist type.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.400
Then there is something called S three than we have something called instances to and then

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.360
we have a 1,000,000 a year for its elastic file system.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.280
So I have kept in depth session for,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.430
um,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.050
a journalist,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.770
three along with image on,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.840
if it's so in decision.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.370
We're going to discuss a voter,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.800
imagine TVs and the snapshots,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.050
and we will discuss about the instances store as well.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.110
So now if you close you look in tow this diagram,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.650
then you will find that the instance or say easy to instance is being connected with.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.360
We're 80 off different kind off stories,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.150
debates or,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.060
say story types like you bs as the office.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.990
But their usage pattern is little different that we will discuss in detail.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.570
So basically image on easy to provide you with a flexible,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.810
cost effective and easy to use data storage options for your instances,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.550
like Armajani Office amateur newbies and Madonna's three and Instances told.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.840
So all these options has a unique combination off performance and durability,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.100
and these options for a storage can be used as per our need.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.420
So let's discuss about one way one so we will look into emo Johnny office.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.260
Imagine if it's provides a scalable file,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.430
a storage but used with Amazon.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.050
Easy to.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.840
You can create a new office for in system and can trigger your easy to instance to mount

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.440
the files.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.530
You can use any of its file system as a common data source for workloads and application

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.490
running on multiple instances.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.570
Now let's understand about instances Tour Instances Store mainly provides temporary block

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.780
level storage,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.980
for instance,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.380
is the point which I'm going to discuss now regarding the instances tour that is very

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.300
important point.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.870
So you should remember that and appointed the D tone and instances to volume for system

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.880
only during the life off the associate ID instance.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.670
So that means the moment you will stop or terminate an instance.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.100
He sued to instance,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.130
any detail that is a stored on instances store volume is lost,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.970
so this is very,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.370
very,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.810
very important point.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.780
There is another type of storage that it has three that spans four simple story service,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.560
so basically edible within three provides access to reliable and inexpensive date.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.540
I strode it infrastructure guys,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.820
we have detailed discussion about a 1,000,000 as three in the upcoming station off this

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.280
course.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.860
So these are the some of the important point about the AWS s three bucket a story broke.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.890
It is mainly designed toe.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.590
Make Weber skill computing easier by enabling you to a store and retrieve any amount of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.240
data at any time from within image on easy to for anywhere on the Web.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.770
So basically as three is mainly used for taking the backup and keeping it there.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.750
For example,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.160
if we're taking the backup for Evie's,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.390
then we're keeping it s three work it.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.430
So if we look into diagram here,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.320
it is representing the same thing.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.550
So here they're taking the backup snapshot is nothing but a backup off E V is volume,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.770
and that is being kept that image industry and really it is kept,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.340
which is kept into a bucket.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.710
So when we were discussing Able Tammi Jonas three,

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.530
then you will come to know about what is this Bucket is.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.840
So now let's discuss about the elastic block,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.520
a story that the previous elastic block restore.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.640
It provides block level storage volumes for use with easy to instance.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.850
Basically,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.960
TV's volume behave like roll on for motor block devices.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.020
You can moan devious volumes that devices on your instances.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.970
You can mount multiple volumes on the same instances,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.550
but the condition over here is one Lear.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.680
Single volume can be a test toe.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.840
Easy to instance at the time,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.860
one of the major feature off TVs volume is that It is highly available and reliable storage

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.430
volume that can be attached toe any running instances that is in the same every livability

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.430
.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.850
Joan.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.120
So you must be asking that what is the benefit off?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.020
Using devious volumes compared to instances store.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.600
So,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.890
as I already mentioned in the earlier discussion in the same station about the instances

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.720
told the lights,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.890
I can love or see the life span Off Instances tour is associated with the life cycle.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.120
OPC two instance.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.130
The moment,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.050
easy to instance,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.370
go terminated instances.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.880
Tours get deleted.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.560
So too,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.170
will come.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.100
This challenge,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.900
devious comes for rescue.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.650
The major benefit off reveals instance.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.910
Previous volume is that it is independent off easy to instant.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.830
If anyhow,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.890
ec2 in Stan's got terminated.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.980
Devious volume can remain.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.850
That means it is independent off easy to life cycle.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.050
And imagine also recommend to use devious when you want to access the data quickly and you

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.700
have a requirement to post is the data on a longer term.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.820
So in salt,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.380
we can say that previous volumes are particularly well suited for use as the primary story

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.080
for file systems,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.340
databases or any applications that require fine granular updates.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.720
and access to unformed.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.450
It'd block level storage.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.810
So,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.080
no,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.510
we have discussed about devious volumes.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.140
Let's have some discussion about even snapshots.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.690
So where does this snapshot means?

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:37.200
So Snapshot is nothing but backup off previous volumes and the snap shorts are incremental

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.990
backups.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.280
So where does it mean?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.740
It means that one leader block under device that have changed after your most recent

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.100
snapshots are saved?

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.980
So such feature really minimize that the time required to create those snapshots on DSI one

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.840
is storage cost by not duplicating the data.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.850
So on a theory.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.310
Inspect.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.780
These are the things which I wanted to discuss with the decision.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.340
You know,

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.590
next session we will do the lab in the lab station.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.940
We will create any C two instance and we will stop the instance.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.690
And then we will detach the previous volume route volume,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.450
and we will take the snapshot.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.050
So this is the exercise we're going to perform in our lab.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.970
So see,

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.660
in the lab station Until then,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.940
Bob,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.550
I take you
