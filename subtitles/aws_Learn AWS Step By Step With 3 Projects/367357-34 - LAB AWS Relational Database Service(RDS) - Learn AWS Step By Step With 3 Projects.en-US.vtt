00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
Hello,

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.640
guys.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.660
Thanks for joining the session in decision.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.150
We're going to do a lap on eight of Louis Relational database service.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.080
That is our ideas.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.980
So let's look into the exercises.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.130
What are the exercises?

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.150
Which we're going to perform in this lab.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.650
So in this lab,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.500
we are going to create my esque will db instance.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.110
And then afterwards,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.740
we will download and install a sequel plane that is equal plaint workbench.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.970
And we will use that sequel plane to connect toe this my sequel db instance.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.220
And once it is being done,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.030
then we will believe their db instance.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.890
So let's jump in tow the aid of Louis management console.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.240
And from there we will use the RDS console and create the bicycle baby.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.850
Instance.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.550
So we are intuitive Lewis management console.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.040
And here you need toe click on our ideas,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.710
which is on database section.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.060
Click on our ideas.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.830
Then it will take us tow RDS console.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:58.130
Now we need to click on create databases and here we will get the option to choose the data

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.010
creation methods.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.150
So we're going to choose the standard create,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.800
and here we need toe up for engine option.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.480
We have a variety of options.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.650
Have a level over here.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.850
But we will choose my sequel for this lab.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.790
Once it is being done,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.650
then we need to select the free tier as we're practicing on it.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.400
Then afterwards we need to specify the database.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.290
Instance Name here we will provide that rds underscore demo.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.910
Under the school instance,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.150
you can select the same thing.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.630
So here the naming convention is not being supported.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.670
So what we need to do,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.600
we need to change.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120
It will put hyphens.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.550
It will take and then we will proceed for the We will take the name and we will keep the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.200
same name or as a master user name.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.240
And afterwards we need to provide the passport once it is being done.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.720
Then we will proceed for the and confirmed the passport,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.360
the same passport and here db instance side which I already mentioned about this thing in

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.400
our theory section.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.230
Here we are getting an option was stable classes for two free tier and we are getting DBT

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.940
to micro,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.260
which has one virtual CPU and one DV off ram for this particular devi instance which is

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.240
coming with free tier now moving for the We have always storage again.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.170
We're sticking with the default option.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.630
That is general purpose.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.870
SSD and Allah created a story which we're getting with.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.820
The free tier is 20 GB.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.930
No moving for though we don't have option for Marty.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.660
Easy as we're using free to you.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.260
Then we will proceed further and look into the connectivity.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.040
So this is pretty much important.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.950
So you should focus on two things while setting off the connectivity.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.300
Need to click on a distal connectivity configuration.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.330
And here you should make sure that you will be choosing Yes,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.720
if you will not choose Yes.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.190
Then you are not able to connect to the this DB two instance on another option.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.900
You should make sure that you will be choosing create new for this three pc security group

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.900
.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.860
So here you need to specify that the security group name are deists Demo SG Now we will

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.040
proceeding for the We're just living as is no preference.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.870
So eight of Lewis will pick any off the availability zone over here and then we have the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.500
port number.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.370
We will leave it as is the database authentication.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.170
We're going with a password authentication over here,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.880
we have also optioned to set of the backup along with the monitoring,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.300
so you can click over here.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.060
You should provide the name of the data,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.370
miss.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.680
What would be the initial name?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.450
We are going to give it as our Deace Demo TV and then afterwards we will leave it as it's

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.750
for backup retention.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.550
We can provide one day if you have any option to select the window size off the back up.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.330
When this black of filtered kick daughter,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.860
you can select this and you can specify your start time.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.800
Then we have an option for monitoring.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.840
Here you can select the monitoring it was selected.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.650
Then you are able to provide the configuration for that.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.250
So we will leave it as is.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.410
And there is a maintenance.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.580
We know that you can also specify if you will select that.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.700
Think that you need to respect.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.850
We find that when the maintenance will walk up,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.200
we're going to stick with the default preference.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.320
That is no preference.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.850
And there is another option we're getting over here.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.070
Resolution protection.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.970
So if you enable this relation protection,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.350
then you are not able to delete the database,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.150
so we are not going to stick with it.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.120
We will leave it as is now here.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.880
The pricing.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.430
It is telling that we're going to get 7 50 yards off our ideas.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.590
If we're using Cretier along with that,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.570
we are getting 20 GB off general purposes stories That is office city type.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.710
And then we have 20 GB off automated backup storage.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.120
Now,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.340
we are happy with this thing.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.240
Now we need toe to think you should make sure Well,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.540
clicking on career data with the 1st 1 which I already mentioned that you should select the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.740
public accessible.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.510
Yes.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.400
And here you have provided the create new no click on create database.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.120
So here the instance Name is not good.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.150
So we need to give some name of when you let it be like rt is devil Instance Cope It

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.520
changed the password.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.040
We can keep the same name so that we will not forget.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.900
So as it is a demo So we will leave it as is now what we will do,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.470
we will take concrete data bits so it will take five minutes to create the database.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.410
So it started Now if you will see you.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.910
You will find that went to the creating street.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.650
So we will wait for it And once which is being done,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.090
then I will come back.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.560
So I'm pausing the video now.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.210
So no,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.100
the database has been created over you.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.630
CEO,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.280
you're getting successfully created.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.810
Data bits?

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.160
No,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.480
we will proceed toe the second exercise.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.110
So now what we will do.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.840
We will Don't know this sequel client from where you are in.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.920
So let's grab the u.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.200
N.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.190
So this is the US from where we need to download the client.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.990
That is my sequel Client workbench.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.360
So Corp it I have provided you this link in tow the resource section so you can use that.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.850
So we will come here.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.380
Open the browser is the US and we will go to the u R l and we will grab the disclaim.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.450
We really click on download and here you need to click on this.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.720
No,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.070
thanks.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.890
Just to start my download and it will give you this file.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.440
Click on,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.040
say filed.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.750
Once it is being downloaded,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.230
then we will get this m s a file we need to right click and click on install his two

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.340
started installing.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.040
So here in the region you need to click on next.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.860
For your case,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.020
you will be getting complete or custom option.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.620
You need to select complete option,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.050
as I have already installed,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.790
so that the reason I'm getting this option and then you need to click on next,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.500
then next and you will get the install option.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.750
So click on install.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.720
Once the installation is being done,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.050
then you need toe a penda,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.820
my sequel,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.890
Client workbench.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.280
So click on finish.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.670
So let's proceed further.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.650
So we have created our my sequel Live.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.170
Instance.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.290
We have downloaded and installed the sequel claim.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.550
No,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.760
we will open this SQL client that is my sequel were Bent Client,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.430
and then we will connect with that client to do this.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.690
My sequel databases,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.180
which we have created at the roster step.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.290
So let's open the my sequel claim.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.250
Workmates were into my sequel,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.160
Workbench client Soto Connect to the data with You need to click on this plus icon and here

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.780
you need to provide our ideas.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.800
Demo connection.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.820
Let's give a name,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.660
and here we need to specify the endpoint.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.850
So let's grab the endpoint from Made of Louis RDS console.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.450
Soto,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.960
grab it.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.930
You will be getting view credential detail.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.260
You need to click on this.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.220
And here you will get this option.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.420
Click on copy.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.450
It is being copied.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.650
Now we will go to the workbench client that it might sequel Weapons client.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.390
And here you need to specify that.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.520
And the user name?

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.850
No,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.360
we need to grab the user name.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.410
So here,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.030
we need to grab this user name,

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.520
which we have a specified at the time of creation.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.990
Copy.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.230
Go back to my sequel Client Workbench.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.280
And here you should based it on the password.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040
You need to specify Over here.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.910
Store in world Here,

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.700
you can disperse.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.520
Why the passport?

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.060
Okay,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:53.100
no test the connection authorities successfully done No.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.160
Next we need to click.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.650
OK,

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.740
And here,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.430
right click,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.550
open connection.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.050
So it is taking time.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.760
Now we have connected to the AWS rds,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.550
my sequel database engine.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.490
So if you create anything over here that will be created in tow eight of Louis rds,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.390
my sequel database engine.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.600
So we have completed the sex is now moving further.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.990
So we have connected.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.850
We have created my secretive instant.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.190
Then we have downloaded and installed sequel plant What we did in the last two step we have

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.650
connected to the my sequel date of its No.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.710
Next we need to delete that deviance tents which we have created.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.040
So let's jump into the my sequel workbench plaint and we will close that.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.070
So first we will close this one and then we will go to AWS Management Council and from

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.300
there we will delete the db instance.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.450
So we're here now.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.010
So close this one.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.660
And now what we need to do we need toe,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:51.730
select this one and go to the action and click on delete And here you need to de select it

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:51.730
.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.850
Then you need toe,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.640
acknowledge it and here you need to specify that.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.750
Delete me.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.760
Then you will get an option toe relief so you can click on it.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.010
So it will take another five minutes to relieve this rds instance.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.260
And once it is being done,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.160
then we will done with this slap it is still the leading.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.450
So let's wait for it.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.820
I'm going to pause the video.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.090
No,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.670
Once it is being done,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.560
then I will show you So no,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.340
the databases being completely deleted.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.890
If you will repress this based,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.550
then you will find that the data with has gone now.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.750
So just repress it.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.660
You will find that there is no date of its presence.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.160
No instances being prison.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.680
So let's jump into the exercises.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.910
What are the exercises we have performed so that we will wrap it.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.710
So in this lab we have gone through creation or for my secretly re instances.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.100
Then we have downloaded and installed sequel plane.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.240
And with the help of sequel plane,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.760
we have connected to the mites equal later with and at the end of the session,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.300
we have deleted that instance.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.470
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision seeing the nexus.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.000
Until then,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.230
Bob,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.790
I take you.
