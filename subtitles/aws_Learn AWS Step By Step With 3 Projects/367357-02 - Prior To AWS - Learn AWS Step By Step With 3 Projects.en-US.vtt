00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
Hello grades.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.700
Welcome to the first session off our first course in need of Louis Automation cities to

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.520
indecision were going toe discuss about what was there prior to eat of Louis here.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.210
Eight of Lewis's the representation off Cloud Computing as eight of Lewis is one of the

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.760
major player in cloud computing in space.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.010
So instead of keeping the name prior toe cloud computing,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.320
I have kept it as pride to AWS for this topic.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.700
Cause in this journey we're going to learn about it of Louis.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.860
So we will talk only a voted of Louis.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.460
So let's jump into the diagram.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650
And then we will start our discussion right to AWS System Administrator,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.120
often used to talk about service as a whole union,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.930
and that is called Data Center.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.770
That includes the hardware,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.910
the operating system,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.300
the storage and the application servers and the applications.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.040
Overs are often referred to await their function.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.430
That is,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.900
like exchanges over the Sequels over the file silver.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.820
And if you look into this inmate,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.890
then you will find that how this always is being organized.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.970
These words are organizing on racket spaces,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.790
so you can imagine that if something went wrong,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.910
then it is really very painful task or cumbersome task for system administrator.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.520
So I didn't to find the problem and rectify it.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.290
And in keys off hardware failure,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.150
the system administrator must add a new solo.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.270
So you can imagine that any company wants to have ah,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.780
fault tolerant infrastructure in place for dollar and means if anything goes wrong on the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.090
solo than others,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.900
over can easily take place the rule of that particular so over.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.100
So you can imagine that how difficult and how tough it was to design a fault tolerant in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.840
France structure or system administrator to resign,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.750
such infrastructure for $4 system administrator can implement Cluster also was to make them

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.760
more for dollars.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.470
However,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.340
even clusters have limits on their scalability,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.950
and not all applications work in a cluster environment,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.180
and we all know that everything comes with a cost along with the cost of maintaining.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.140
So to save from these hardware and maintenance costs,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.340
the virtual server came into place,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.540
which also concept separate the server software away from the hardware.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.570
This includes the operating system,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.380
the applications and their stories,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.530
for that's over with such innovation.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.780
So where is no become just finally stored on a physical walk instead of physical hardware.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.490
So no,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.840
you must be asking me.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.130
OK,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.430
OK,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.630
so I understand that how physical so is being replaced by which also or say how virtual so

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.720
over taken place or physical server.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.340
But why do we use cloud computing?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.730
Why do we use aid of Louis?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.350
So to answer your cushion,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.600
I want to quote an example and with an example,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.200
I want to make you understand.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.500
Suppose you're a CNN dot com and CNN Salvos Operation hour,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.720
nine AM until five PM in a day.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.750
Then why is print resources on the sober during night when it is not actually used?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.530
If CNN Who's there Sobel themselves,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.110
then why living in title during its known operational hours?

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.240
So the better solution to host your debt cloud.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.300
Then eight of Lewis comes into picture.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.540
We will host the website in Amazon's E.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.760
C.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.930
Too easy to refer,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720
says elastic Compute cloud,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.660
which I am going to discuss in upcoming session,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.620
for the time being just considerate as a virtual sober where we can host our website.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.550
So if we're hosting our website on easy to then we will prove is a new servers every day,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.120
and D probe isn't them every night by paying just 0.1 sample sober,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.830
poor our or might be a little more for higher capacity servers,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.910
and we don't need to worry about the hardware's.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.280
Let's imagine running about the hardware cloud computing takes for two logician,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.300
one a step ahead.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.650
So,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.010
no,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.720
I hope you understand that why we use cloud computing and eight of Louis,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.000
because it is really very cost effective.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And whenever we want we can use.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.880
That's over,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.770
and we can be by use it on.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.960
Whenever we don't want,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.250
we can d prove is on it.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.920
Let's have some more discussion on cloud computing so that you will be more comfortable

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.060
with the jargon core cloud computing.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.700
So so far,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.010
we have discussed about how physical So where is migrated toe What rules over now In this

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.320
cloud computing era,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.570
cloud computing takes virtual addition one a step ahead,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.950
where virtualization provides the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.590
political system and seared down the lying hardware resources and with the power of cloud

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.320
computing,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.050
it provides the ability to probe reason the services in a timely manner or so whenever we

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.550
want it on the mind manner,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.000
we can allow them to a scale up and scale down off resources whenever it needed.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.280
We just need toe provide the configuration read of Louis can take your off scaling open the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.960
scaling down off your servo asper,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.410
your configuration in the upcoming station.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.340
I'm going to design a project where I will show you the same capability.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.050
That is how you have ability and four tolerant and France structure within eight of Louis

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.040
that is going to were very fun exercise.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040
So with this North,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.450
I'm just to stopping here.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.770
There are various thing coming in our upcoming session,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.090
so stay tuned and see in the next system.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.620
Until then,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.880
Bob,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.490
I take here.
