00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
hello.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.800
Grades will come to another session in this session.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.170
We're going to look in tow,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.270
virtual private cloud.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.720
And we will understand that.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.990
What?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.590
Actually virtual private cloud.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.380
It's on water,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.950
the component involved in designing the virtual private cloud.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.310
So let's jumps into the discussion.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.910
So far,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.250
we have seen easy to in stances elastic block a storage security groups.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.510
These resources off Ada blew.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.330
It doesn't provide much control or somewhat complete.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.630
Nitto,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.990
design the infrastructure as we want because it is belonging.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.750
Toa defer to re PC.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.860
If you closely look in tow our previous love,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.370
Then you will find that whenever we're creating any easy to instances,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.140
then by default it is belonging.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750
Toa 44 To be Peter,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.230
you must re asking that.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.630
Okay,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.290
I understand that there is no completeness.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.140
There is no much control but work actually this virtual private cloud And in short,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.460
I can say that virtual private cloud is service offering from AWS,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.560
which enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network which you have defined

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.880
using some new technique.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.090
The virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you're operating in your

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.350
own data center with the benefits off,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.790
using the scalable infrastructure,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.720
afraid of Louis to understand virtual private cloud in a more better way.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.110
First,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.460
we were looking toe water,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.710
the component which is involved to design the virtual private cloud.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.400
So let's jumps into one off the diagram.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.940
So here you will find that VPC components.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.360
So these are the components which actually helps us to design our own virtual private cloud

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.360
,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.960
where we have much control over our virtual private network to here,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.350
Every component have their bonus specific rules within the virtual private clothes.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.020
But we will discuss all these components in details and understand that what is the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.150
significance of those competent?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.580
Why we had using it within VPC designed.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.850
So let's understand the competent one by one to really start with sub nets.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.090
So as we already discussed that of what your private cloud is a virtual network dedicated

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.940
to your AWS account.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.210
So that means it is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the aid of Louis

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.670
Cloud.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.550
So what is happening when we had creating a VPC?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.110
So we must have to specify your range off I P addresses and these I P addresses is a range

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.750
off I P B four red dresses in the form off cider blocks I did block is not a new concept

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.610
for those who belonging toa networking background.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.700
But it is a new concept for those who is not belonging.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.840
Toa who were not belonging to networking Bagram.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.490
So in short,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.590
I can tell that side of Loch is nothing but the class less interred,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.950
um in routing block.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.530
So where does it mean?

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.660
So basically our virtual private cloud has many submit and eats.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.190
Avnet has range off I p addresses.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.690
So who actually defines this strange for some it.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.200
So the answer is side of Loch.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.150
So to better understand it,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.530
let's jump into the diagram.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:27.190
So here you will find that the cider block for this three pc is 10.0 10.0 dot 0.0 Last 16.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.870
So that means our submit will reside in these trains on for though,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.800
if you will find here there is to sub minutes of net one and submit to and that has a range

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:48.550
of five peas from first sudden it has 10.0 dot 0.0 slash 24 2nd one subcommittees It was

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.280
looking toe the third octave.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.650
Then you will find that it is changed to one.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.680
But overall it is belonging.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.550
Toa this range only 10.0 dot 0.0 Last 16.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.440
So here,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.310
with the help of side of Loch,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.000
this VPC range is being defined to understand it more better,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.980
we will Juman.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.070
So this diagram and looking toe another diagram which is a subset off this diagram.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.000
So let's jump in tow that diagram.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.840
So basically,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.690
to look closely,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.380
you will find that every PC expense all the availability Jones in the region.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.810
And when you create a sudden it,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.000
you will specify the cider blocked year.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.340
This insider block for the submit which is a subset off this cider block CEO.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.900
When we created this,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.660
this range is being used.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.920
Oh,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.860
and see a It is a subset.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.400
It is a subset off this side of law,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.160
so the range of sudden it will fall within the cider block range.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.550
Some points to remember is that east submit must reside entirely within one have liability

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.550
,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.950
Joan.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.060
That means the range of sudden it belongs to the particular every livability.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.520
Joan So Now we understand the side of Loch.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.050
Let's move further and discuss over the summit.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.550
Ah,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.520
submit is a range of I P address in your BBC.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.640
Be looking toe the diagram.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.800
Then you will find that it has in the sub net one.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.580
It has two instances and that will be falling within the range which is a specified within

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.380
the subject.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.630
One.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.780
It will not fall into the range which is defined within the subject toe.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.380
The C two instance which is belonging to some NATO,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.100
will be within the range which is being a specified within some NATO well,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.950
creating the VPC.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.330
So here you must get some clarity that at the vpc level,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.280
the segregation happened with those cider block within the cider within the BBC.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.840
The segregation happens for the instances by the submit to eat something,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.370
it has their own range and the instances which is belonging toa that particular submit it

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.260
must be falling in tow that strange which is being allocated for summit.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.570
This concept is really very important Because of that reason,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.540
I am emphasizing on this topic so that once you understand this one,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.050
it is really easy to design the What shall Private cloud.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.010
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.320
See,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.110
in the next session where we will discuss the another week with the compliment.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.210
Tilden bubble,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.370
I take you.
