00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hello,

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:00.850
guys.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.140
Thanks for joining decision in decision.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.270
We will learn about how the aid of Louis interest actually is being set up.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.080
But bridal,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.560
going into the detail discussion about it of Louis Cloud infrastructure set up,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.250
I wanted to make you understand about what is cloud computing is.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.510
So to understand that,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.980
let's look into her diagram so basically cloud computing,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.560
you can understand it as a group off shared physical resources made available to enable

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.130
consumption off compute and storage capacity on a need basis using Internet.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.980
These shared resources can be located in multiple locations across the globe that enable

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.350
accelerated access to the floor resources like so vos databases and other man it's services

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.350
.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.750
No,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.600
let's understand about need of Louis Cloud infrastructure set up.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.210
But prior to going into a detailed discussion about it of Louis Global infrastructure,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.420
Let's and this turn that white cloud infrastructure matters.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.610
Companies around the world are moving toward cloud based infrastructure to increase ICTY,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.930
agility gain,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.470
unlimited scalability,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.200
improved reliability and lower carts.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.490
These companies weren't the flexibility to expand their operations at a rapid pace without

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.970
worrying about setting up a new I T infrastructure as you know that setting up a 19 France

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.650
structure is a costly affair,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.910
and the reason being is that they want to enhance their end user and customer experience by

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.230
minimizing the Litan.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.660
See on the time it takes for their data packet to travel so they can avoid really and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.420
interruption.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.580
So,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.880
no,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.270
let's understand about AWS global infrastructure.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.450
The aid of Louis Global Infrastructure is designed will to deliver the most flexible,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.330
reliable,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.920
scalable and secure cloud computing environment with the highest quality global little

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.380
performance every level today that the reason Amazonian Media player in Cloud a space the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.770
era of Louis global infrastructure set up,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.160
has 22 geographical regions,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.890
and this diagram regions is represented with the blue dots in the orange darts is upcoming

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.230
regions and these regions has multiple availability.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.030
Zones have liability zones,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.050
are designed for physical redundancy and provide resilience which enables uninterrupted

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.270
performance even in the event off power outage,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.460
Internet downtime,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.090
floats and any natural disasters.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.810
So let's zoom into the diagram.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.250
So here you will find that it has six availability zones.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.020
This reason,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.930
and this is a representation off North Virginia.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.700
Reason off image on eight of Louis cloud.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.550
So basically everybody zones.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.400
Our data center in the reason these have liberated Jewel's have the actual physical

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.210
resources for cloud services have liberated zones are interconnected by high speed land toe

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.950
enable four tolerance and high availability.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.090
So weapon case one availability zone and sat down due to any reason at least another

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.580
availability zone is the level to see it.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.050
The Lord.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.380
Now there is another term that is called edge locations,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.150
as locations can be seen as so was kept geographically closer to users.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.060
These soldiers can act as a cash storage that enable faster transaction of frequently

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.950
accessed data.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.680
Transfer.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.580
Acceleration technique is used to provide monster data transaction off new data.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.810
So you must be asking that what is the benefit off all these setups?

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.380
The benefit we will get on the set up is high performance,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.500
high availability,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.620
security,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.830
high reliability Along with the capability off rescue ability.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.690
You can a scale your application any time with any number off instances as but your need.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.800
And as per your load off the application and all these bill coming with the locals,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.530
as I already discussed with you,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.980
a known earlier session set up all this,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.510
we need our data center and to set of the data center.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.780
It is very costly affairs because hardware costs on the maintenance of hardware cost is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.440
very high.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.950
And if you're a growing business,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.620
you can't think off to know enough off talk.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.510
Let's jump into eat of Louis Management console from where I can show you how you can

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.960
choose the regions and how it looked like If you're confused about these Jagan's don't

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.360
Woody,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.060
you were going toe learn all these in the upcoming station,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.410
so we're into it of Louis management.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.380
Console it.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.410
A blues management console is one of the interface by which you can interact with the aid

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.720
of Louis Resources.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.540
I have a little discussion or say digitalization on AWS management console for a timing.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.140
You just consider it by using it of Louis Management console.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.200
You can play with eight of Louis Resources now coming back to the topic.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.290
If you want to know which regions we are currently belongs to in AWS management concern,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.680
then you should look in tow this extreme rate,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.430
and here you will find that North Virginia reason.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.790
So it is telling that we are in tow.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.720
North Virginia.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.150
Reason.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.880
If you want to change the region,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.220
then you come here.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.840
Click you and you can change anywhere.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.170
So it is always preferable to choose whichever your nearest location.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.050
For example.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.880
For my case,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.170
my knees issue specific moon way.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.250
So I will choose Monday,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.870
which is nearest to my location.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.660
So no,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.220
you understand about were to find regions in AWS management console and how to change it

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.160
now moving further.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.460
How do we identify how many have liability?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.450
Jones have a level.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.810
So the easiest way is to identify the have liabilities on you should come here and within

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.950
computer option.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.430
You will click on Easy to,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.770
and it will take us toe the easy to management console.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.100
And here you will find that we have total number or three availability zone in this year.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.060
Pacific reason.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.190
But if we will change it to the North Virginia reason,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.470
you will find that it is going to be changed to six.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.860
So let's look into that.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.420
So here you will find that we are in tow US East,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.620
North Virginia reason,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.420
and we have total number off.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.540
Six have lovely T zones,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.370
so this is the way you can identify the regions as well as they have lividity zones.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.430
So you must remember these two terms because you're going toe area where these storms

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.990
frequently in our upcoming sessions.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.060
So on this note,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.400
I'm closing this session.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.070
Seeing the next session.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.800
Tilden bubble,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.400
I take it.
