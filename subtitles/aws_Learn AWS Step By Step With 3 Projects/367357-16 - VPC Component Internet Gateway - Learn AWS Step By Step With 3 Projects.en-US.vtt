00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
Hello,

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:00.870
guys.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.870
Thanks for joining decision in decision.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.340
We're going toe looking toe,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.350
Another repeat see component that is Internet gateways.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.490
Who?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.920
Let's look into the diagram where we have left earlier.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.240
So in this diagram,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.760
we have already discussed sub net out table.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.150
No,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.730
we will do their discussion on Internet get way.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.600
So what is Internet gateways?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.640
So basically,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.860
Internet Gateway is one off the VPC component that allows communication between instances

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.110
in our everything on the Internet.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.520
So basically an Internet gateway serves two purposes.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.140
Forced it provided target in your VPC route table for Internet route,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.480
table traffic and second toe perform network address translation.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.640
For instances that have been assigned public I p v four address is so majorly for these two

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.170
things.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.710
Internet Gateway is being used within VPC infrastructure.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.550
Internet Gateway supports both kind of traffic.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.700
That is I p before and I people think now we will move further and we will look in tow a

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.170
diagrammed wonderland,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.450
the Internet gateway you know,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.900
more proper manner so that you can get a holistic view about the Internet gateway.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.620
And whenever any questions comes regarding Internet Gateway so that you can confidently

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.810
answer the question.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.160
You know,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.830
let's jump into the another diagram.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.350
So now you can look in tow This diagram and you will point the Internet Gateway can be used

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.530
to to provide the access off Internet toe the instance off the Southern that So here the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.280
questions comes over here Is that how do we enable Internet access for the easy to instant

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.280
?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.320
So then I can say that this is more off lab question.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.870
But again,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.670
I wanted toe introduce their steps which is required to enable the Internet into the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.290
instance off BPC.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.640
So basically it is a four step process and the forced to step what we need to do we need to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.460
attach an Internet gateway to the world should pray,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.030
would clothes.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.820
That is our VPC Now Can you tell me what would with a second district?

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.880
We have discussed aboard this in our previous component discussion exact,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.320
so we can make an entry off Internet gateway into the root table.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.420
So when we attach Internet Gateway toe the VPC for providing the access off Internet toe

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.820
the easy to instant,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.440
and we should make sure that we should have unique of leak,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.350
I ve addresses is allocated toe.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.070
Each instance is reachable in stances.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.000
Going toe have Internet access.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.200
So this is the third sister p should rally.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.120
Did the uniqueness off I P addresses off each easy to instances now coming to the fourth

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.390
step.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.420
This is also very important and we have already discussed able this thing in one off our

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.480
earlier discussion.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.720
So the fourth step is we should make sure that Security Group,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.910
often easy to instances,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.080
should have ruled to allow Internet Gateway l Security Group will not allow the Internet

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.650
access.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.820
This is one point.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.620
Another point.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.190
There is something called network access control,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.190
which we will discuss later in the course.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.090
But for a time being just considered that Nicholas,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.380
also one of the component of virtual private cloud,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.720
that is,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.620
we PC that should also have an entry toe allow Internet gateway within nickel.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.120
So this is really very important to the fourth point,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.550
which we have discussed for enabling the Internet access to easy to instances.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.030
We should make sure that nickel network access control should have entry to allow Internet

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.610
Gateway and and Security Group should also have an entry to allow Internet gateway So now

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.430
we understand that how to enable Internet access to any off the easy to instances off

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.590
virtual private cloud.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.280
So now we will move further and we were discussing about some of the points to remember.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.830
So the first point You should always remember that to use an Internet gateway yourself,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.810
Nets wrote Table must contain a rule that data Internet bound traffic toe the Internet

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.390
gateway.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.040
Another points to remember is that in a will communication over the Internet what I p

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.070
before your instance must have a public i p before red dress or and elastic I period rid

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.510
that's associated with the private eye.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.990
Be before address on on our instance.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.920
Our instances only aware about the private I P addresses speed defined within the VPC and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.170
submit another points to remember is that the Internet gateway logically provide the oneto

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.820
one not on behalf off our so that when traffic leaves our re busy sub net and goes toe the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.560
Internet,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.260
the reply addressed religious said toe the probably cape before rhetoric or elastic i p

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.580
address off your instant and not its private i p address.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.890
So this is about enabling communication over the Internet for i p.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.560
Before now,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.350
we will discuss about how to enable communication over the Internet.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.340
But I'd be very sick.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.970
Soto enable communication over the Internet for right people say so to enable communication

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.820
over internet.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.260
For I people think our VP CS Avnet must have an associate ID.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.550
I previous six cider block and our instance must be assigned.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.050
And I PV six Andhra.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.580
See you.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.790
There is a beauty six address and this is IBV.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.530
People red dress in the diagram from the range of the submit and make sure that I P v six

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.090
addresses are globally unique and therefore public by default.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.250
So this is what I wanted to discuss in this session.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.850
Seeing the next session.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.950
Tilden Bob Arctic you.
