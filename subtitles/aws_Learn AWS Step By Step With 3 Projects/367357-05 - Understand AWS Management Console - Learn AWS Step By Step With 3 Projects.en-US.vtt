00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Hello guys.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.680
Welcome to another session in this session.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.300
We're going to look in tow.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.990
ADA blew it.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.200
Management consultant.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.290
But prior to that,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.740
let's look into our journey.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.290
So far.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.090
So far,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.320
we have seen that what to pose happening,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.690
right to eat of Louis.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.960
Then we have understand that what is region and what is their availability?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.310
June.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.720
So these are the two concept,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.060
which was very important,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.990
so we have understand that now.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.350
After that we have looked into how to set up your free tier er on AWS,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.590
and now we have created they come No.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.050
The next step is that we have to understand that what is eat of Louis management console is

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.130
but right toe that I wanted to discuss some of the point regarding it of Louis Management

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.850
console.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.710
Basically eight of Louis management console is nothing but an interfering or say mechanism

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.200
by which you can interact with eight of Lewis and its services.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.440
So to understand it,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.830
whether that's somethinto,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.450
the little blue it management console and understand that worked,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.690
my statement means Soto access console what you need to do.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.450
You need to read this address https,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.570
and he'll have to need right console taught.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.040
Imagine eight of those daughter Megan dot com,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.020
then in tow.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.200
So this will take you to the aid of Louis console management site,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.200
and here you need to provide the credits is use the account,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.460
which you have used for account creation,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.000
with it of fluids.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.150
For example,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.340
I have used this email address.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
Then I need to mention over here and click on next.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.260
After that,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.860
you need to provide your passport once you log,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.240
and then you will find that this screen.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.190
So this is Krienitz Guard eight of Louis Management console.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.200
So here the question comes that Why do we use it of with Management Council?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.140
So to answer your question,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.810
the aid of Louis management console provide the interfaith toe access the aid of Louis

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.980
managed service.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.320
As I told in our of your discussion that eight of Louis offer various services to their

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.020
users.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.790
So we need a way by which we can access those services or say we need a way by which we can

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.670
configure those services to use it for the so eight of Louis management console.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.330
Provide that mechanism.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.340
For example,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.290
here you will find the list off.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.020
All those services over here were like,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.500
and it is being grouped together like compute Instance.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.270
We will discuss all this thing in the coming session for the time being.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.130
Just considered that so computers a group machine learning is a group,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.680
and these air the services which belonged to a particular group.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.000
So they have categorize it like that way,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.070
same way stories,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.610
database analytics.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.460
So so many service offerings provided by Aid of Louis.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.050
We're not going into all these services,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.740
but definitely I will provide you technique or a way by which you can work with any of the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.410
services.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.290
With that technique in the scores,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.880
we will play with some of the commonly used services manually forced.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.350
And then we will do the automation off those services.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.750
Whichever services which I explained in the man will part off the scores.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.100
So moving for the let's understand the console is water.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.950
They'd Yet it has given that if you look in tow the right side of this screen,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.280
then you will find that this is the profile which is being given over here,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.980
your profile description and you're seeing that it's coming like out Virginia.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.490
So this is the region or the forced region.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.230
You can see that where it of Lewis was long and then it s spread it across.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.580
So here you will find all the regions where aid of Lewis's having the presence,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.340
and we need to select the table the nearest region,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.370
like issue specific moments.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.280
But the thing is,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.720
whenever either blue is is coming with new services,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.730
it will be forced,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.270
released with not Virginia.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.360
Reason subjected.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.730
We can stick with North Virginia reason because we can get an opportunity to lick unwto

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.130
water,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.010
the services,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.840
all the services you will find in North Virginia.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.240
Reason.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.060
But it is not.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.730
But it is not necessary that you will find that services in that other particular region.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.250
But it is very good practice.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.310
If you were sticking into the nearest region,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.650
why?

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.600
Because it will provide us a low latency while accessing those services.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.510
So that means that suppose that if you're trying to access any services,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.660
it will take lesser time if you were accessing toe the nearest region.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.100
But if you're trying to access some other services from the other region than it will take

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.630
more time,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.030
or say latency is very high compared to the nearest one.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.970
But in this course,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.560
we are going to stick with not one Virginia reason.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.860
The ones we understand that let's move further.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.130
So here you can also access the services with help off the search box.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.770
So if you want to access,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.110
for example,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.850
as three,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.280
then you will be accessing like this reachable service which you want to access.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.490
You can write the name of that service and it will be coming over here.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.660
You need to select it.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.880
So this is one of the way that is other way.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.320
You can access the services like that here.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.630
Also,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.440
you will find those information.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.260
For example,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.330
you will get the information like which group it's always belongs toe the same way you can

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.620
get the complete glance,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.800
overview and year old,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.380
so unique toe right thoughts always name with this mega menu.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.790
So this is a mega menu they have provided and what you need to do you need to provide.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.640
For example,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.390
I want to access e care service.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.550
You need to write it,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.680
and it will give you the managed to burn it on aws so all the IT services.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.460
They're telling it as a resource.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.130
You can manage those resource as put your convenience and that's for your project,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.000
whichever it'd so you can come here.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.610
You can create the group of those resources.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.390
You can say you can check that want are the groups you have seen,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.800
and you can also look into the tag editors tag editors can be used to man is the services

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.150
which you have created and tagged while the time off creation off that services.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.370
So from tag editor,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.940
you can manage those who says I haven't created any services,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.530
so you will not get over here.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.380
So this is the use of tag editors or design ways.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.490
Imagine has created very simple design off their AWS management console,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.030
and they have provided really good documentation on each of the services.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.020
The how do we can access the documentation to access the documentation?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.960
What you need to do,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.990
you need to come over here and take condo documenting.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.090
So here you will get the details about all those services that you want to learn about.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.880
You can kick on documentation,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.830
and it will take you to this location and where you can search for the information about

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.550
that service.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.130
It'll see it has provided the duty aerial as well along with the project,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.940
so you can look in tow those documentation as well.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.040
So I would recommend that bookmark this page because I am 100 portion show that we will be

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.570
coming back by and then tow this page to get the information about it of Louis managed

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.350
services.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.450
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate your indecision.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.150
So see,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.460
in the next session till then.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.040
Bye bye,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.600
kid.
