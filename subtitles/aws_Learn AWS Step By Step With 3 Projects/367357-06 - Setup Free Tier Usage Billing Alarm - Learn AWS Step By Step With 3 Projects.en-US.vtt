00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hello,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.640
guys.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.530
Welcome to another session in this session.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.470
We are going to look into how to set a building alarm.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.860
So in this aspect,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.880
what we are going to do,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.310
we're going to cover the following things.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.290
So basically,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.690
we will understand that what?

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.130
Actually it is why we had using it and how we are doing.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.410
But prior to going into these discussion,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.320
let's look into the journey which we have covered so far.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.870
So so far we have looked into what was happening prior to it,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.540
a blue ists.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.420
And then we have seen that two important thing for the entire it of Louis concept that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.190
disease in an inevitability jewel,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.040
if you understand this thing than it is very easy to understand the aid of Louis

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.020
infrastructure.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.800
After that,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.630
we have seen that how to set up the aid of Louis Free Tier account.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.500
Then afterwards,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.410
we have seen that eight of Louis management console,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.700
where we have discussed about why we are using AWS management console.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.010
No.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.840
In this session,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.950
we're going to look in tow setting of the building alarm into eight of Louis.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.690
But prior to going into how to do the billing alarm set up in need of Louis.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.130
We have to understand that why we had using it and what Actually it is so as you were than

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.740
either Blue.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.130
It's comes with various services and some of the services which AWS offers in prettier,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.280
but not also with his faults into the free tier.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.750
So that means it is coming with some costs.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.380
So we need a mechanism by which we can monitor our uses off that services.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.660
So to achieve this thing,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.170
eight of Louis provide and interprets for setting of the building alarm.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.640
So no,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.470
we understand that what actually it is and why we are using it to let's move further and

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.880
let's look into the steps.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.950
What are the steps required to setting of the willing allowed to?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.350
Let's jump into the heat of Louis console.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.440
So we are in tow.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.490
Eight of Louis console to set up the billing alarm.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.960
We need to follow these steps First.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.870
We need to goto the my building dashboards or we will be getting these options here.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.940
We will get that cost management Cost Explorer budgets budget report.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.490
So all the thing which is related with the cost and budget,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.620
you will get over here.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.880
So we are mainly interested in this session with the building preferences.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.520
So we need to click on the building preferences.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.890
So we will be getting these options so we will be mainly interested in receive free tier

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.700
usage alerts so we will enable it and we will provide the militarists.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.850
If you will not provide,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.090
it will take the ROOTY County militants.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.780
But we will be interested in plowed program here at gmail dot com.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.760
So here I want that all the alerts were getting prettier.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.080
Usually I won't at this email address,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.180
So once you have provided you river Remillard is the next step is you have to select the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.490
receive building alerts.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.490
Once you inability,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.420
then you need to configure the cloudwatch.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.840
So race off aid of Louis for sending the allure to your email address.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.350
So this is really important.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.140
I have a detail station on cloud would service.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.180
So for a time being,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.990
you just to understand that Lord watches one off the service which will take care off all

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.810
the monitoring related task off AWS can be configured within cloudwatch services.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.760
So now we will move further and configured.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.080
The cloud was service so that we will receive the building alerts.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.220
You can do it way too with post.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.860
Either you can click over here.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.890
It will take you to the same location else you need.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.130
Toe,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.800
come here on a pipe cloud what?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.310
And you will go directly to the cloud work.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.660
So let's understand this cloud was service.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.470
Over here you will find that there are various options for the cloud.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.270
What services?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.490
You will find that there is a dashboard alarms building event rules,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.350
even bus logs inside matrices,

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.010
settings,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.520
all the thing which is required to monitor or say monitoring related operations.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.270
You can configure over here.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.600
So in this session we will be interested in building related I think so.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.150
We will be going in tow building.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.980
So here you will get an option called Create alarm.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.650
You will need to create alarm.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.660
So here it is pretty easy to configure,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.620
as the steps has also been given who over here you will find that specify matrices and

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.360
condition,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.470
configure actions at a description preview and create.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.040
So we will do the same thing and you will find the detail over here.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.610
If we want to change the currency.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.310
You can do it from here and then here you need to select that water.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.490
The condition you're going to apply as we are doing this is for our learning process.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.450
So we will not exceed more than $5.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.180
Once done,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.350
click on next.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.240
So here you're going toe see another kind off a new service called s Illness.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.370
Like a simple notification service.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.370
So this service will take care of all the notification related asked.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.500
So,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.720
guys,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.280
this is really very interesting.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.280
I want to explain you in a better way.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.190
And this will give us the understanding off the architecture off eight of Louis.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.550
So let's jump in tow one diagram which I want to explain you.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.830
So,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.120
guys,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.090
see this diagram in this diagram what it is representing that AWS has various services

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.530
which is designed for a specific purpose or purposes.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.390
They have a very good design.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.500
If you look into that,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.850
then we will find that here we are using cloudwatch and simple notification services to set

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.420
up the building alarm within that once always calling another service and assigned their

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.710
respective task.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.980
So,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.150
as we have seen that while the creation of willing alarm we are going toe create cloudwatch

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.640
and within the cloudwatch what we're going to do,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.550
we are creating a simple notification service.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.620
The reason behind to swing this diagram is that you saw No,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.290
we start thinking eight of Louis Services as an object.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.430
You can think that cloudwatch is an object,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.060
so it must be having some properties.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.240
It must be having some 1/3 which we will do their discussion in our part two of this course

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.240
.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.730
So to create simple notification service,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.850
we need to create a new topic.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.730
And here you need to provide the name of the topic.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.020
We're going to provide a name called Building Alarm.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.330
Next,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.880
you need to provide your email,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.450
a wrist like I'm going to provide my human urges.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.820
And you can also provide comma separated the militants.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.080
If you want multiple places to receive the email.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.810
Once done,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.690
create topic.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.240
So it has created a new simple notification service with you can verify over here you need

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.580
to go over you and you will check that it has created on simple notifications off.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.750
So what you need to do next,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.800
you need to go to your inbox and confirmed the notification.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.550
After that,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.710
you will start getting the notifications whenever you're building for 32 year usage is

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.290
getting exceeded from your A specified amount.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.090
So now proceed further and complete.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.050
The remaining is take.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.800
So here,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.000
Once we have provided that and we know we need next and here you can provide the detail

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.680
with the description over here.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.510
Once done,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.020
you can click on next.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.980
The ones done.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.620
You will get the preview and create So here,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.050
If you want to do any changes,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.210
you can again do,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.640
they did.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.200
If we want between the currency and anything,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.440
you can do it over here.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.540
Once it is being done,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.610
you should come here and click on the create a lot so it will create the alarm.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.220
You will start getting the email once you do that.
