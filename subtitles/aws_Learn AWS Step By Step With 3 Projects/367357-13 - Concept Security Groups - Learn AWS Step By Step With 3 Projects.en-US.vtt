00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
Hello,

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:00.930
guys.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.990
Thanks for joining the session in decision.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.070
We are going to understand security groups off eight of Blue.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.910
It's so let's jump into the discussion.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.930
Let's look into the journey so far.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.240
So first we have understand that what is prior to the head of Louis then we have seen that

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.470
two important Jagan's,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.000
which is really important within UW,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.750
is that these regions and availability Jones Then we have also seen the lad how we have set

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.990
of the free tier account.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.780
After that,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.850
we have understand that how to use eight of Louis Management console.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.650
Then we have set up the billing alarm so that power usage is reaching to our trees or limit

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.650
.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.520
Then it will notify years.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.460
So we have set up that building alone,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.530
and we have understand that identity,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.810
access management and we have done the love.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.350
Also,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.900
after identity access management,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.620
we have discussed about elastic cloud compute,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.250
and we have done lab on that as well,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.550
using manual the steps with aid of Louis management console.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.570
Then afterwards we have discussed revolt elastic block a store.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.030
Now we are in two security groups,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.970
so here we will discuss about the security group.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.610
So prior to discussing the security group,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.170
I wanted to share two concepts and so that it would be easy to understand security group.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.550
So let's look into one diagram.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.610
So if you're seeing this diagram,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.940
then you will find that to Tom's that is inbound and our born.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.360
So why it is important to discuss inborn and or born tried to discussing security group is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.990
that because security group is mainly used toe handle inbound and are born traffic,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.960
So what does it mean?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.680
So inborn is nothing better.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.780
Incoming traffic toe access,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.890
your easy to instance and out boned is related.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.390
Toa outgoing traffic from your easy to instrument to access the Internet so all security

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.580
group discussion will be goes around these two concepts.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.600
If you clear about in bone or bone,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.030
you can easily understand security group.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.740
So now we understand that in bond and our bone.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.200
So no,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.010
let's start our discussion about security groups opposed that if you are having an easy to

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.990
instant and you must be thinking that how you can allow and disallow other computer to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.450
access,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.900
your easy to instance.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.550
So here the security group concepts comes into picture.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.460
So within eight of Louis,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.500
you can manage the security off.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.660
Easy to instance,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.780
with help off Security group.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.580
So basically,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.890
Security Group act as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.740
For one or more instances,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.070
easy.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.590
Two instances when you launch an instance,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.720
you can specify one or more security group.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.510
You will not specify any security group than it will pick the default security group.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.180
You can add Rules to Eat Security group that allowed traffic toward from its associated

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.640
instances within eight of Louis.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.950
The management of security group is really very easy.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.410
You can modify any time the rules off security group on new rules,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.850
which you have added into a security group that will be automatically applied through the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.450
instances that are associated with the security group.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.220
So look at this diagram.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.540
So it is representing the same thing here.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.780
This is inborn traffic,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.120
and there are born traffic,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.500
and here we are having the easy to instant,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.990
and that will be managed way.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.810
The security group and we will do the lab session.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.350
Then I will show you where you can write the inborn rule and where you can read our born

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.220
ruled by default.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.190
Inborn rules is not allowed,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.190
but out born rule is allowed.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.190
So what it means.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.960
As I already explained in our inborn and Norgle discussion,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.250
inbound means the request coming from the Internet to access the C two.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.980
Instance,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.070
This girl in Born on the request,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.830
which is going from a C twins,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.860
tends to the Internet that is out born.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.440
So caution comes over here.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.240
Is that how do you manage inbound and our born for a specific I P means How do you allow an

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.390
I p to access?

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.150
The easy to instance to Here comes the concept of security group rules,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.780
so security group rules.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.130
So it basically do the job off,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.820
allowing this alot often i p to access the easy to instant.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.210
When we do the lab station there,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.850
I can show you so that you can better understand it.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.490
So let's now discuss about types of security group with the native Lewis,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.990
So basically we have to type of security.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.770
Group one is the false Security group on another one is the custom security group,

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.830
so let's discuss one by one.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.910
So the false security group is already exist within your AWS account along with the Fort

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.430
Vpc VPC.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.120
We're going to discuss in for the session off this course.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.180
So for a time being just considered,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.750
that it is a private cloud,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.170
virtual private cloud with mainly company prepper who set up their cloud environment.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.680
So you must be remembering that whenever we are creating easy to instance,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.570
then we need to provide the configuration detail while creating the easy to instance.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.130
And we get an option to choose the security group.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.810
If you don't provide the security group at the time off creation off,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.050
easy to instance,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.650
then it will automatically pick the defaults security group for your easy to instance.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.250
So if you closely looking toe that before security group,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.650
then you will find that it has a rule that allows all in Bonn traffic from other instance

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.450
or saying Stances,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.820
which is associated with the default security group can access each other,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.480
and out born traffic from the instance is also allowed.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.430
So these are some of the important point for default.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.460
Security group.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.560
I will demonstrate you in our lab station where we will create an issue to instance,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.330
and we were looking toe our default security group is being assigned.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.850
If we don't provide any kind off security group,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.140
toe the instance,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.610
so now move further.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.160
And let's understand that what actually custom security group is so prior to discussing

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.830
about Custom Security group.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.450
We must have to understand that in what scenario you can use the custom security group.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.990
Suppose if you're working for a company and that company has various departments like a

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.040
char finance I T.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.490
And each department has their own easy to instance,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.070
and you want to restrict the access off Finance Department from other department.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:31.180
So if you're going with the default security group option that that is not really feasible

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.180
,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.040
options as by default,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.560
default security group or say all instance has access to each other as their belonging toa

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.210
que for security group.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.210
So you need a mechanism or a way by which you can handle the granular level off security

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.590
for each instances.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.620
So here,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.600
custom security group comes into picture so you can create a different custom security

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.630
group for each of their department,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:04.240
and you can associate or create a security group rules for each of the customs security

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.980
groups where you can handle the security requirement off the particular department you can

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.090
easily manage.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.080
I will show you in the lab were to define the security rules.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.890
So no,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.920
we understand that.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.280
Custom security groups who we will stop over here and we will do all this thing in our lab

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.760
sessions.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.090
Bob,

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.850
I take care.
