00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
Hello,

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:00.820
guys.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.850
Thanks for joining Decision in decision.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.360
We're going to discuss about a major industry that is the stand for simple stories service

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.360
.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.550
So let's start our discussion.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.090
So what is image on simple story service or say what is a magician s three?

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.530
So basically image in simple stories.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.450
So this is a story service for the internet.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.410
This service provide a simple web interface that we can use to a store and retrieve any

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.140
amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.010
So no tried toe going in towards detailed discussion.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.430
I want that we should look into the S three concepts to let's look into the S three concept

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.430
.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.550
So these are the five key concept or so jargon Zor say terminology off as three,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.080
that you will get well working with test three.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.220
So let's discuss about one by one.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.250
So the first concept is buckets.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.410
So every time you work with this three,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.070
you will hear the dome buckets.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.280
So basically a bucket is a container for objects stored in S three or in a simple tone,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.850
we can say that every object within a street contained in a bucket.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.100
Now moving for the we were looking toe objects of what is There's three objects.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.800
So in s three bucket.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.540
Whatever.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.290
You will restore us tour as an object.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.790
Objects are the fundamental entities stored in image industry.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.950
So where does this object princes?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.780
Object consists off object data and the meta data data represent anything which you want to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.250
restored with the ministry.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.290
Like text Well,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.930
or your video will in any other kind of royal or any other kind off information which you

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.920
want to historian.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.020
Oh,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.150
here comes the question.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.230
What is meta data?

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.990
So basically,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.770
meta data is nothing but data about data.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.860
That means meta data contains information about the data which is stored within a street

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.020
market as an object.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.900
For example,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.470
if he was told a file than meta data off that file,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.330
it's something like when the file is being created within three.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.030
Work it when it was mortifying.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.200
What is the wasn,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.180
as it supports,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.120
wasn't ing as well.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.140
Who such kind of information is called meta data.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.750
That is data about data,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.640
and it comes in the form off name value pairs that basically used to describe the object.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.610
No moving for the we will look into another concept that is called keys.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.570
So what is keys within the street?

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.590
Home in the Keys is related to the identity off the object.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.260
So in simple Dome,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.210
a key is the unique identifying for an object within a bucket.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.030
So one point to remember over here is that every object in on Bucket has exactly one key,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.830
and the combination off a bucket key.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.880
And wasn't I?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.220
D?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.480
Uniquely identifies each object from the development perspective.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.260
Every object in Amazonas three can be uniquely address through the combination off the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.320
bucket name G and optionally awards and as a Web service and point no moving for the let's

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.150
discuss about regions.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.480
So what is regions?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.510
So regions related to geographical aid of Louis region were a Madonna's three Willis toward

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.220
the buckets that we create.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.140
So it is always recommended to choose our nearest reason to restore the market so that it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.150
will help us to optimizing the latency and minimize the cost.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.740
And sometimes it helps toe address regularly requirements.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.200
So what does it mean in certain scenarios?

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.110
Some companies don't want their data belongs to other regions support considering their

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.740
data security now moving for the we will discuss able data consistency.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.580
Image industry provides read after right consistency for port.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.880
So new objects in our history work it.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.570
So in a simple tone,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.150
we can say that data consistency is mainly related toe the mechanism by which you can store

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.040
the data.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.120
And once you retrieve the data,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.520
you will get the same data and return.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.890
So what does it mean?

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.130
Let's understand with a better example,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.350
Suppose that whenever you put an object into the S three bucket Soto achieve higher

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.150
availability.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.910
A 1,000,000 as three replicated the data across multiple.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.170
Sir,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.490
What's within eight of Louis Data Center?

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.890
So,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.140
in case of failure,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.290
you can get the data which you have saved it to know Coming back to know.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.650
We understand that Tammi Jonas three concept.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.020
No,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.250
we will move further and we will look into some of the features off history.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.380
So let's look into the features and the features we're going to discuss about the Imagine S

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.290
three classes,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.420
bucket policies,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.210
aid of Louis,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.050
identity and access management,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.880
which we have already discussed.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.490
But we will discuss here with the perspective off a street,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.170
then we will also look into access.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.020
Control is we will discuss about poisoning and we will discuss the vote water.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.930
The operations,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.190
which is being supported by AWS,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.680
has three.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.540
But first,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.010
let's look in tow the image on as three classes.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.170
So what is Amazonas?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.030
Three classes?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.770
Basically,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.580
history comes with a variety off levels and which is coming with different pricing model

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.220
along with the different durability and have liability.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.990
So if we look in tow this chart,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.820
then you will find that it is nearly six type of storage classes.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.480
That means,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.520
as three comes in sick types off.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.090
Offering that means 1st 1 is the standard,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.950
which is designed for frequently.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.220
In this offering,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.960
Aid of Louis provides durability off 11 nines that is,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.150
99.9 time 9% and availability off 99.99%.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.010
And to achieve the high availability,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.160
it is replicated toe more than three zones,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.620
or at least three zones.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.690
In such offering,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.430
there is no commitment.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.230
That means you use and pay for usage,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.980
no moving further to the other offering that is a standard infrequent access,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.050
this particular kind off a storage classes basically designed for long lip,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.910
infrequently accessed data.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.990
It is really a good option off a storied if you want to restore infrequent data,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.030
which is something like the data with you access on a weekly basis or monthly within such

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.690
kind of later you can store in such storage class and AWS provide the same kind of

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.260
durability and availability.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.810
Same like a standard one.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.990
In such offering backup is also have a level in three availability zone,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.060
or more than three of availability zone.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.280
But here you should at least committed for 30 days,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.520
and you will retrieve the data people that,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.850
as positive military will feed the third kind off a storage class is really very

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.400
interesting,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.980
one that is intelligent,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.480
tearing this kind off,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.910
offering a sort A will for those scenario where your data retrieval pattern is no different

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.800
and your retrieval is changing as sport need basis.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.140
So in such offering durability and availability of similar,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.750
like what we have seen in a surrendered and this turn Dirda year,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.660
they're dealing frequent.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.250
Texas,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.380
along with the availability zones,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.820
that is,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.670
it supports,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.960
or it takes back up in three every level.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.560
It is ALS and more But here also commitment needed for at least 30 days.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.340
There is no retrieval Peasley,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.840
the child monitoring and automation be on a par object bases moving toe,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.780
the another storage class that is one's own infrequent Texas.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.650
This is a good choice for our own critical later.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.130
Their durability is similar to what we have seen in earlier stories.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.910
Classes or the availability is different from the other three,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.930
and it is 99.5% and the availability zone.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.990
It is at every level toe only one of lividity zone,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.450
and the freer structure is based upon the retrievals.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:36.250
In this kind of stories class your data is not highly of level as it is belong to a single

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.390
availability zone.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.380
So in case off,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.270
really your or any disaster off that particular availability zone,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:48.010
you will not get the data back now moving for the We will look into a storage plus Cordless

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.360
here.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.710
So let's hear is basically designed for long term rate archiving.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.190
But their retrieval is little slow,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:01.630
which is ranging from minute to our AWS provide same kind of a durability for Glacier,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.880
which it provides for other fourth but availability.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.430
Boys it is not a straightforward forced.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:14.440
You need toe restored the archive data and then you will get the 99.99% availability and

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.410
the backup is placed within three of live elitism or more.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.880
But here the commitment needed in 90 days and retrieval way you first need toe restore the

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.560
data before access it.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.240
And here also the charges is as Bert db basis.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.470
So another kind of storage classes are others which is not recommended by AWS.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.870
And it suits in scenario where infrequent access of data and that data should be known

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.550
Critical data and there,

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.800
dude,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.930
ability of ability and of lividity.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.250
Jones matches the same which we have discussed for the standard a standard a year and

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.280
intelligent eating.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.570
So no moving further,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.820
we will discuss about bucket policies.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.710
But prior to discussing about the bucket policies,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.820
we must have to understand that what actually policies is with the needle bluest policies

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.060
provide on my canon.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.930
Well,

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.310
we can define the access control tudo resources off radar blew it.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.660
So in the same aspect,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.380
bucket polices relied centralized access control,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.560
toe markets and objects.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.450
Please don't over there 80 off conditions including which operations are allowed which

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.790
operations are not alone.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.400
Operations.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.590
We will discuss for that in the same session with the help of policies,

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.660
bucket policies we can define,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.790
who will access the work it and who will.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.300
No taxes the bucket with the needle bluest.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.890
The policies are expressed in the access policy language that basically enabled centralized

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:45.500
management off omissions on the permission which is attached to a bucket which will be

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.250
applicable toe each of the object that belongs to that particular bucket.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.550
No moving for,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.840
though,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.670
that today the bluest identity and access management.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.810
We have a Tory drill session on this topic,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.710
which we have discussed earlier.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.980
If you haven't gone through that session,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.930
I would such is that you can go through that session from the image industry bucket

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.590
perspective we can use.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:13.880
I am with Imagine s three toe control The type off axis ah,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.290
user or group off user has access to a specific parts.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.380
Often imagine three bucket off our AWS accounts.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.230
So let's proceed further and let's discuss about access control list.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.110
So is here.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:33.390
This is again another mechanism by which we can control the access often eight of Louis

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.200
Resources.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.110
So basically,

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:41.230
it's he answer one off the resource based access policy options that we can use to manage

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.030
access to our buckets and their objects.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.270
We can use its heels to grand,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.110
basic read great permissions,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.820
other AWS accounts.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.210
So here comes point to remember for the seals,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.700
and the point to remember is that you can grant permissions only two other accounts.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.680
You can't grant permission to users in in your account.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.950
You was re asking that in what scenario you can use a seals.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.540
So suppose a bucket owner allows other AWS accounts toe upload objects,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.330
permission toe.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:19.950
These accounts can only be managed using object issue by the aid of Louise Ciccone.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:25.820
That won't stop object now moving for the let's discuss about worsening so basically

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.020
worsening usedto keep multiple was and often object in one bucket.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.010
So what is the benefit out off it?

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:37.780
So basically the functionality off worsening help us toe prevent from accidentally

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:43.640
overrating or deleting object and provide us a way to retrieve the previous words and often

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.150
object.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.100
No moving for the let's discuss about operations in the three offering,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.510
we can for form various operations like we can create an object,

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.940
we can write an object.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.290
We can read an object.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.540
We can relate an object.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.160
So these are the operations we,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.430
which region really perform to a free lake.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.150
Enough of theory is being done.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.730
Let's stop decision over here.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.410
And in the next session we will do the labs.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.300
And whatever we have discussed,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.750
we will perform those exercises in aid of Louis management console.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.670
So that's it for decision seeing the next session till then,

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.930
Bob,

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.520
I take it.
