00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.440
We'll leave this four column space off on the right-hand side.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.680
This is where we're going to add a sidebar for our blog.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.215
Just like the finished version which you see here,

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:13.335
it will have some sections with some information about this bar.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.915
Also we can filter down by categories or by the month it was created.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:24.870
Let a little social media section at the bottom too of any blog, to HTML.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.595
We can create some space just above this closing row.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.420
If it helps, you can add a comment inside here.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.960
Say this is the closing row.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.935
Also we can say this is the container,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:44.070
just so it's more clear we are right.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.350
Then we create our div.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.430
In fact, we add this as an aside.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.890
Since it's a sidebar.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.100
This sidebar is going to have a class,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.650
make it four columns wide on smaller devices and above, so called sm-4.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.920
The sidebar will contain the four blocks as we just looked at.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.050
The first is just a little bit about this bar.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:17.520
A surrounding div for this block still will have a class of py-3.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.030
Just to add some spacing on the top and bottom.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.060
A title for this block "font-italic",

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.470
and the title of about.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.060
Then the text in the p elements.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.490
The p elements will have a class,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.550
to add margin and bottom of zero.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.235
Then we want to paste in the text for this one.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:47.745
We're just going to grab this off the finished side.

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:55.195
Paste the same, followed by a horizontal rule with the hr elements just below this.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:58.440
Let's check this out over into Chrome.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.905
Reload our blog page.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:03.845
Next up we have the archive section.

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:07.190
On the finished version, this is going to be a ordered list,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.670
which is going to have each list item as a date.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.890
We can start with a surrounding div as a container still within the col-sm-4.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.405
My new surround in div.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:26.250
Just like above this is going to add a class of py-3,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.455
so add our spacing.

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.485
We then go to add a level four heading.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.605
This is also going to be italic,

00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:37.125
would be font italic class.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.940
Then the title of archives.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.860
Our items are going to be inside a ordered list.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.324
This ordered list is going to have some Bootstrap classes.

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:53.440
The first one is going to be list-unstyled.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.085
List-unstyled removes the default list style and the left margin on our list items.

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:04.160
Then we'll set the margin bottom to be zero.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.335
These list items will have a link nested inside.

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:11.440
We can add some dates into here.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.195
Then a href for the a elements.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.030
We can just leave this empty. All you need to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.480
do now is copy and paste this in a few more times.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
Add some random dates into here.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.485
This would be generated by WordPress later on,

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:30.690
save and then refresh inside of Chrome.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940
That's all we need to do now for the archives.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.145
Next we go to do a similar section,

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:39.905
and this will be for the categories.

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:44.055
A new div just before our side section.

00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:46.785
Following the same pattern.

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:49.960
The class of py-3,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.960
a title which is going to be level four,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.680
class of font italic,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.010
and the text of categories.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.055
This will also take in a ordered list with the same classes as above.

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:11.220
This one will be list-unstyled to

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.190
remove any list styling and also set the margin bottom to be zero.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.435
The list items also nested with a link inside, a empty href.

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.260
We can add in the news.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.205
We can also add in the offers too.

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:33.150
The final section is for our followers section which is

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.735
going to be some social media links using the font awesome icons.

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:43.540
We'll create our div, class of py-3.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.470
Inside here, I will have a four heading once more,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.540
which is again going to be italic,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.215
with the text of followers.

00:04:55.215 --> 00:05:00.270
This is going to have some i elements for our icons.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.960
First class of fab and then

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:14.925
fa-Facebook.It's going to be square and then fa times 2 x to make them twice the size.

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:17.850
Let's add another three into here.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.840
This next one wants to be Twitter and then in surround which doesn't need the square.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.850
Then finally Pinterest.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.840
Save this and reload.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.705
This is our sidebar now complete.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:42.370
In fact, this is our blog page also complete.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.375
We've now got a blog template which we can convert WordPress in a later section.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:53.280
Next up we'll finish off our Bootstrap templates by adding a contact us page.
