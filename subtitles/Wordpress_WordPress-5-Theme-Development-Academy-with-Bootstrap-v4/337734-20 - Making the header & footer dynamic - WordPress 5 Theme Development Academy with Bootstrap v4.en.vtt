00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.395
Now, onto the header and footer.

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:08.849
At the moment, we have our HTML code from the bootstrap templates.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.460
This is fine for static websites but we want to hand over control to WordPress.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.890
I'm going to begin by going over to our HTML and then passing over control to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.640
WordPress by adding in some PHP tags to make use of the built-in WordPress functions,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.895
starting with the header.php.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:34.560
Let's open this file and then go up to the very top.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.995
We can add a PHP comment.

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:42.040
Open up the PHP, close this off,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.715
which is just like this.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.370
Your comment will simply be the header for our theme.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.325
Since WordPress is built in the PHP programming language,

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.985
we need to add any of our built-in WordPress functions.

00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:00.475
Also between these PHP tags,

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:03.965
we can open and close these tags anywhere in our HTML.

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:08.155
For example, we're going to replace the language attribute.

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:11.050
Let's delete this from the opening HTML tag,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.530
open up the PHP, close this off,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.910
and then we can add a WordPress function called the language attributes,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.970
followed by the brackets and then the semicolon.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.770
These PHP brackets when used inside of the HTML,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.695
will signal the start of HTML code.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:37.610
Then we close this off, and then the file will return to regular HTML.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.155
Language attributes is a WordPress function used to set the language of the page.

00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:48.400
But how does WordPress know which language you want to use?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.950
Let's go over to the browser and take a look.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.170
Let's reload this, right-click,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.210
and then "View page source".

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.210
If we look up at the top for the opening HTML elements,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.840
we see we have the language attribute set to English, US.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.640
Yours may be different for your install,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.755
but we can see that this is not what we set over in our file.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:16.775
We don't see any of this PHP code which were added in.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:20.660
Instead, we see the actual language which we are using.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.215
This is because PHP is rendered on the server.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:27.470
When we get this page back and open the browser,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.215
we don't actually see the PHP code.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:34.940
We in fact see the HTML which regenerates in its place.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.615
This language is set in the WordPress dashboard.

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:42.775
If we open up Flywheel, click on "Admin",

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:46.290
then go down to "Settings" and "General",

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.955
we have the site language,

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:50.280
which we have set just here.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.905
If you want to know more about any of the WordPress functions which we'll cover,

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:58.835
you can visit the codex.wordpress.org,

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:03.805
and search for the function name to find out some more information.

00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:07.310
Next, we're going to set the character sets.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.470
Back in our header.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.050
For the meta character set,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.145
we can remove our hard-coded version of UTF8,

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.860
then inside of these quotations,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.580
we can open up the PHP tags,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.215
close these off, and then inside add a WordPress function called blog info.

00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:32.375
The blog info we want to set is the character set,

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:35.140
which is set just like this.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.860
The default encoding in WordPress is UTF8.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.915
This is what will be displayed.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:46.390
We can also reload the browser source just to double-check this.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.440
There we go. This is set to the default UTF8.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.670
Next up we have the site title,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.815
which I'm going to remove.

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:58.310
So scroll down, we have the title used on here.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.240
We can completely remove or comment this out.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.160
This is because in the functions.php,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.870
which we added recently,

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.645
which sets the theme support for the title tag.

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:15.440
In doing this, this theme support allows WordPress to safely manage

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.135
the page title photos and also declares we're not using a hard-coded title for our theme.

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:25.260
Back over to our header.php.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.640
We can use a PHP function called WP_head.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.175
This will tell WordPress exactly where we want to add the auto-generated info.

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:43.250
The location of this is important as this is used to

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.240
inject all pulling things such as our CSS files,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.510
any scripts and they're going to be inserted here exactly where we've added this.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.175
We will also take a look at how WordPress handles

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:59.110
our CSS and our scripts in just a moment but first,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.040
we're going to move down to the body class.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.740
Let's add this inside the opening body tag,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.155
which means PHP. Close this off.

00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:12.810
then add other WordPress function called body_class;

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.455
On this one too.

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:23.980
Still making sure to close off the HTML tag right at the very end.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.770
By adding this body class to the body section,

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.010
this allows WordPress to add any CSS classes,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.280
which is required, just in the same way as we

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.285
would in regular HTML by adding the class attributes.

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:41.975
But now instead, this is under the control of WordPress.

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:45.455
If we save this and then reload our page source,

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:48.970
and if we locate the opening body elements,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.080
which is just here,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.590
we now see all of these classes which WordPress has added.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.765
These classes do change depending on the page we are viewing, our logged-in states,

00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:02.210
if there are any errors, and so on,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.005
but this is all handled by WordPress behind the scenes.

00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:10.010
We can even add our own classes to each page too,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.630
simply by adding them as a string inside the body class.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.185
Let's go for custom.

00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:20.565
Give this a save, reload,

00:06:20.565 --> 00:06:23.990
and we should also see our custom class added on the end.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.820
This is added as a string.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.410
If we had multiple classes,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.515
we could add this as an array. I'll type in array.

00:06:31.515 --> 00:06:36.215
Inside the brackets, we can add our first value separated by a comma.

00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:37.955
We can add a second value,

00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:41.775
let's say custom 2, "Save" and "Reload."

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:45.050
This adds multiple classes to our body.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.255
We don't need these for this project,

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:51.400
so I'm going to remove these and just leave the empty body class.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.330
When viewing the page source,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.615
you may have also noticed that we now have some extra content in the head section.

00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:01.790
If we scroll up, we have all of this code which is on

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.820
here and also all the links down below.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.255
These all being added in automatically by WordPress.

00:07:08.255 --> 00:07:10.950
These are all styles and scripts which WordPress has

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.715
added since we included the WP_head function.

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:17.625
This is just below our custom CSS.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:20.360
If we look for our custom CSS here,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.705
this is all of the WP_head content added just below.

00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:27.050
We also have our site title,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.405
which is automatically being added even though we removed the hard-coded page title.

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:34.970
The final change to the header I want to make in

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.525
this video is the site title at the very top.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:40.355
If we go over to our project,

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:43.510
this is the site title which we have in the link.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.485
Currently, this is hard-coded and WordPress has no control over this.

00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:51.020
Let's go ahead and change it now.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.150
Handle over control to WordPress,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.005
we use get_bloginfo passing in the name.

00:07:57.005 --> 00:07:59.360
If we scroll down to our nav,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.915
we have the site title inside the A element.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.595
We can remove this.

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:09.430
Let's open up the PHP elements and then close it off.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:16.670
Inside here we can echo the blog name by get_bloginfo.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:21.640
Inside here we're going to pass in the information we want to receive back.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.040
This is the name of the site.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.790
If we save this, and once again,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.594
if we view the page source and then scroll down to our header section,

00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:35.890
mine is on line 62,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.035
and here we see the site title of Tranquil Spa.

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:41.505
Back to our site and reload.

00:08:41.505 --> 00:08:43.620
We also see it just here.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.190
To see where this is set,

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.065
we can once again go to the general settings and then go to site title.

00:08:50.065 --> 00:08:52.940
If we add anything just after here,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.340
hit "Save", "Reload the site";

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.570
we see the changes are reflected in the browser.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:04.040
Let's change it back to Tranquil Spa and then save.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.540
The last thing I want to do now in the header is to have

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.315
the site title link back to the homepage when we click it.

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:13.325
Currently, if we click it now,

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:17.230
we're just using a empty href, which is set here.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.900
This works for now, but we want to make sure WordPress is also

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.320
fully in control of this by adding the PHP element.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:31.560
Close these off and then we're going to echo escape URL,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.715
passing in the home_url as a function.

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:41.840
So the home_url retrieves the homepage from WordPress,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.250
and we pass it into escape URL to remove or

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.825
clean up any unnecessary characters such as any ampersands,

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:55.145
percent symbols, or generally any character which is not needed.

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:58.100
Save this and now just double-check everything is still

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.055
working by clicking on Tranquil Spa and go back to the homepage.

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:06.380
There is a small change to make to the footer too.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.320
If we open up the footer.php,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.960
scroll down to the bottom of the file.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.060
Just above the closing body tag,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.030
we need to add a WordPress function called wp_footer.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.205
We'll put the brackets, the semicolon.

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:28.145
This is a little bit like the wp_head,

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:32.450
which we did in the header section just here.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.875
It'll be used by WordPress to inject any scripts which you may add.

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.990
Add in the wp_footer,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.670
therefore tells WordPress where to put these scripts.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.685
We also need a PHP comment up the top of the file.

00:10:47.685 --> 00:10:54.040
Just follow the footer, open and close the PHP.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.920
This is going to be the template for displaying our footer.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.860
Give this file a save. We will come back to the footer at

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.045
a later stage when we look at adding things such as custom menus.

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:17.600
But for now, this is the header and footer now changed to be more

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.929
dynamic and also to be linked more deeply into WordPress.
