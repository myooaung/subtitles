00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.170
The next task is to remove the square brackets,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.585
which is at the end of our blog post.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:11.445
I'm going to remove the brackets and then just leave the three dots just afterwards.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.020
This is completely optional,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.405
but I prefer the way this looks.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:18.720
These are automatically added in place when using

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.545
the excerpt function to display the shortened version.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:27.120
It also gives us a chance to look at how we can use a filter hook too.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.445
If you don't know what a hook is,

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.790
hook allows us to hook into the rest of WordPress,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
allowing us to provide a action or a filter.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.445
In the case of this video,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:41.775
I'll be using a filter hook called 'excerpt_more'.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:45.829
To find out more about these hooks and any other WordPress functions,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.755
we can go to developer.wordpress.org/reference.

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:52.725
This page does change over time.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.895
Don't be too surprised if this looks a little different.

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.255
You see, here, we can browse through the available functions,

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:03.640
hooks, classes, and methods which WordPress provides.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.195
If we click on the hooks link,

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:10.430
we're taken to all of the available hooks which we have access to.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.680
There's a lot of these available.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.830
I'm going to click on this magnifying glass and do a search for

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.180
'excerpt_more' and we see this popping up.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.350
I'm going to search for this.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.450
Then we have the code reference for the 'excerpt_more' filter hook and we can see this is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.180
a filter which is going to filter the string in the

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.645
''more link" displayed after a trimmed excerpt.

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.305
This is perfect for what we need.

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:44.360
Let's go over to the 'functions.php' up to the top.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.470
Inside here we've already used some action hooks earlier.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.995
We've already used the 'after_setup_theme',

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.140
which is this one just here.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.700
We will run our 'tranquilwp' setup just after this hook, hard run.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.655
We've also used 'wp_enqueue_scripts,

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.695
which will run our own 'tranquilscripts' just afterwards.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:09.340
I'm going to add our own filter just after this line.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.670
But still we needed the PHP.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.390
I'm going to create a PHP function.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm going to call this anything of your choosing.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.285
I want call mine 'new_excerpt_text' separated by the underscores.

00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:26.685
Open up the curly braces.

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:30.200
All of these function that needs to do is to return a string.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
We've all we want to display in place of the square brackets.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.760
We can use the return statement to return a string.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.880
In place I'm just going to add the three dots with

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.310
a semicolon at the end and the string can be any text which you prefer.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.280
You can see we've got an error just here.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.935
I think we need to add a semicolon at the end and that will fix this.

00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:53.600
Then after our function,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.650
we can add in our filter with 'add_filter'.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.900
This takes in two arguments.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.255
The first one is the filter name,

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:07.100
which is 'excerpt_more', which we just looked at in the documentation,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.780
separated by a comma.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.815
The second document is the name we gave to our function just above.

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:17.410
This is new and add this as a string,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.220
new excerpt and then text,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.385
semicolon at the end and then over to our theme in the browser, it reloads.

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:34.310
Now, it's just three dots at the end without the square brackets.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.760
I think this gives a much cleaner look to our blog.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.620
For the key takeaway for this is to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.055
remember that each time we want to do something in WordPress,

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:46.385
there is often a hook available for this to use,

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:50.095
and it just takes a search of the documentation to find them.

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:54.590
Also, remember to never be tempted to change the WordPress core files

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.110
directly for using these hooks in our custom themes or our plugins is perfectly fine.
