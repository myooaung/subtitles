00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.545
Another important page template which WordPress will recognize is the 404.php file.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:12.675
This is the template which is used when it doesn't recognize a URL.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.570
For example about the top here,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.210
if we add in something which doesn't recognize,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.825
such a random string of text,

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:23.570
we're taken to a page which is not very useful to the user.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.890
In fact this page template is the index.php.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.665
Since as we already know this is the default fallback template,

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.100
we can go ahead and create our own custom 404 file,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.700
which will be used in place of this index.php.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.980
We can add some useful information to

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.345
the user and also some links to get them back on track.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.700
As ever, inside of the sidebar,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.265
we can create this in the root of the project.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:56.370
This is called the 404.php.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.115
As a starter, I'm going to copy the code which is in the archive.php.

00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:05.740
Select all and copy,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.285
then add this into our 404.

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.350
Beginning with the command at the top,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.480
this is the command for display in 404 pages.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.970
Now we can go ahead and clean up this page.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.740
But we still need the header,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.660
we still need the main container,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.115
the row, and this eighth column section.

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:29.870
So now I'm going to move everything inside here.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.640
We can also remove the sidebar.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.755
We can remove the nerve for the pagination.

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:44.730
Let's remove all of the content inside here and tie this up.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.405
This is the closing element for a column section,

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:51.365
then we have our closing row and container,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.720
followed by the footer at the bottom.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.490
Since we now have no sidebar,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.300
we can change this to be the full 12th column grid.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.100
But before we go ahead and modify this page,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.175
let's go over to the functions.php file,

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.905
and we can add our header text for this file.

00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.905
I'm going to do this as a new elseif section.

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:14.000
Just before our else section at else-if,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.400
the condition which we want to test is if this is the photo 404 template.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.230
If it is we're going to run the code inside of these braces.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.085
Let's use a underscore echo function,

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.840
then the text inside of here,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.820
where it is the last.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.545
We can then output a break tag after this at the html elements.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:43.365
Opening this up while this off.

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:45.050
Then enclosed inside a here,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.865
we can add to the text of "Let's get back on track",

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.660
semicolon at the end of this.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.985
We can save this file and then go to the browser,

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:59.430
it reloads, there's custom function text now displaying.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.940
We now have feedback to the user and let them know we are on a recognized page.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.065
But what can we do to get them back on track?

00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:11.155
To do this, I'm going to add some widget area to

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:14.480
allow the user to find out where they want to be.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.280
Early in this section,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.800
we added widgets to our sidebar.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.550
Now I'm going to add some reusable widgets to our content area just below.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.765
First, we need to create some of div elements to add these widgets too.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:33.550
I'm going to add one row with four equal sections inside.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.525
Back to our 404 template,

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:41.610
inside here we can add a div, close div.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.615
This is going to have a class of row.

00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:50.185
This row is going to be the wrapper 404 sections.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:55.240
The div, we're going to close this one off and this is going to be followed columns.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.290
This one will have the class which is going to be called MD-3.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.870
In fact we'll changes to be MD-12.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.939
We can duplicate this to create four sections,

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.000
and each one of these divs is going to be a wrapper for our widgets.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.720
We can use a function called the underscore widget.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.770
If you go over to Google,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.870
now we do is search for codex, the widgets.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.030
We have a function reference which you can click on it just here.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.855
We'll see in a description here,

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:35.120
this template tag is used to display a widget outside of a sidebar.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.610
This is perfect for our use.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.730
Then if you scroll down to the parameters to

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.360
see a list of widgets and how we can use them.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.995
In our template we have access to your widgets,

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.314
such as the archives,

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:51.095
the calendar, any different pages or comments.

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:52.760
We can add a search form,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.310
tags or menus, and these are

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.645
similar to the ones we've seen in the sidebar section before.

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:01.775
I've selected four which I am going to use in this project,

00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:05.275
but of course you can choose four different ones if you prefer.

00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:08.465
Let's start by adding these into our div.

00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:11.925
Inside here, this is php code,

00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:13.560
so we open this up,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.850
the function as we have seen is called the underscore widgets.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.960
Then we pass inside the name of the widget which you want to add.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.980
The first one I want to add is WP, Widget Pages.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.365
Add this in as a string,

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:30.185
then we can add in the remaining three.

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:33.180
Let's just tie this up a little bit.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.795
So the next one, I'm going to copy this line of php at this end,

00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:44.640
and the second one I'm going to add is WP, widget categories.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.860
The third one, this time is going to be recent posts.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.440
Then finally the last one,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.030
I'm going to add the tag cloud.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.320
Let's try this out over in the browser.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.360
Back to our projects.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.075
Good. We have our pages in the first section.

00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:12.235
Let's try the contractors.

00:06:12.235 --> 00:06:13.990
That's working okay.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.625
We can try four categories.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.350
Let's take this to the office templates.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.330
The reason blog posts,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.725
find number 6 and that's working fine.

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:30.875
We can also do a search for a tag and that is working fine too.

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:35.970
You may also notice a title or two when we click on the categories.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.090
For example if we go to news,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.045
get the category of new selected,

00:06:41.045 --> 00:06:44.030
and also the same if we go to the tags.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.165
This is up at the top here,

00:06:46.165 --> 00:06:50.450
this is because this page is using the archive templates.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.195
If we go over to the archive.php,

00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:56.780
we added in a function called the archive title.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.560
This all nicely fitting in together.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.635
This is it now for our 404 page,

00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:05.260
feel free to go a little bit further if you would like,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.720
but this is a good starting point for getting the user back on track.
