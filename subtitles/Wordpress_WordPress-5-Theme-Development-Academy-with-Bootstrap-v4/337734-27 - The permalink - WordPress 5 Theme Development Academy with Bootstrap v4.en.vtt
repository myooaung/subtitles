00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.140
We'll have a shortened version of the blog post in

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.135
the last video using a PHP or WordPress function called the excerpts.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.680
In a typical blog,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.395
we also want this post to link to the full version on a new page when you click on it.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:19.955
To do this, I'm going to make this blog post title clickable,

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:23.990
which will all link to this single page shown at the full content

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.410
and also create a read more link underneath this excerpt to link to the full version.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.575
To do this, we want to go over to where all blogs are produced,

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.380
and this is in the index dot PHP.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.470
Inside the loop we have this blog post title.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.160
I want to surround this in a HTML A tag which is before

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.840
the title and just afterwards we can close this off.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.350
Inside this link, we need to provide the HREF attributes.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.080
Then this is going to link to our permalink.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.940
Open up the PHP.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.920
Close this off. Then inside here we can link to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.915
the permalink add the brackets just afterwards and the semicolon.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:11.535
Permalink is what WordPress calls the current URL.

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:15.515
In our case, it will be the URL for each blog post.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.860
If we save this and then go over to the browser,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.540
we can now refresh.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.445
Now see when you hover over each blog post title,

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:27.065
this is now a link.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:32.530
We can then click on and then we're taking it to a page with just this blog post.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.415
We can also see in the title,

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:36.605
this is got its own unique URL,

00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:38.825
which is the same as the title.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.030
This is blog post 3.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.805
Click on number 1, and the URL is exactly the same.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:49.790
We'll come back to this page later in the course to display

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.905
the full blog post content rather than just the excerpt that we see here.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:02:01.455
Now let's move on to the Read More text just underneath this excerpt. Go back.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.739
Then in our index of PHP,

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:08.525
we can make some space under the excerpt and then create a new div,

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.460
which is going to be the wrapper for our text.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.120
I'm going to add a Bootstrap class,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.460
which is going to be some margin bottom with MB and a value of three.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.715
The content is also going to be a link too,

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:28.530
so we can add this in the A tags. Close this off.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.390
We can simply output any plain text you want in here.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.060
But instead I'm going to add some PHP,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.670
which is going to be the underscore E function,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.700
which will echo or display some text to the browser.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.620
This also means that this is translatable later on in the course.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.255
We can add the text of read more.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:50.030
Then just as we did above with the title,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.640
we can also add the permalink to link to the URL for this current blog post.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.260
The HREF is going to be equal to the permalink.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.715
Save this and we can test it out in the browser.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.670
Go back to our blog.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.205
Click on any of these.

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:10.305
See the Read More text.

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:14.655
This will now also link to our full blog post.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:18.450
Again with the URL set as the title.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.420
We don't have a template set just yet for the single blog post page.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.780
It's going to default back to our index dot PHP.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.425
This is why we just see the shortened version of our blog post.

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:35.350
Just here. Well, this is something which we'll fix in a little while.
