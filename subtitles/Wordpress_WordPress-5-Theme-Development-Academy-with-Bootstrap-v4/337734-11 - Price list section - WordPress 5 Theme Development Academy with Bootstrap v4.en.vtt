00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.010
All done with the About To section,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.720
which we made in the last video,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.329
if you scroll down on the final project,

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.410
this price-list section is going to be a

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.020
little bit more detailed than the one we just created.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.400
We have some different sized columns for layout which have the images on

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.685
one side and also the prices for each type of treatment available on the other.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:29.460
This is the section which we are going to be creating now over in the index.html.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.515
We'll begin by creating a familiar title and image,

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:37.235
and we'll do this in sideshow container and first row.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.925
Just after the About To section will be created,

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:44.630
let's scroll down to the very bottom and add comments.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.820
This is going to be for our price-list section.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.935
Just below this, we can add our div,

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:56.590
which will follow the same structure as before,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.830
this will have a class for the wrapper of container fluid.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.025
Some padding on the Y axis the value of five.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:12.190
I will set this time the background to be dark.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.365
Inside here we need a row,

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:20.170
so this is going to half the class of row inside here,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.135
and this row then needs to have some nested columns.

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:29.335
First of all, we can add our title,

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:34.080
like the rest of the side this going to have a column width of six.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.285
So col md -six,

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:41.580
we can add the offset, which is the value of free.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.795
It's pushes into the center and also the class of text center too.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:50.435
Next in here we can add our level three heading.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:54.300
Level three heading is for our price-list text,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.005
and this also needs a class,

00:01:58.005 --> 00:01:59.990
since we're using a dark background,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.000
we can add the class of texts light.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.005
There's our title, the next step is for our image.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.035
Image source is in the Images folder,

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.375
and this time it's the divider,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:20.475
silver.png the image classes.

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:24.980
First of all, we need some padding on the bottom value before,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.045
and also said this to be a width of 25 percent with W 25.

00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:34.450
The same lets check this out.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.610
Inside the right tab below the above this text,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.650
we should now have our price lists,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.280
and we're just missing the image of that,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.700
and check the images folder.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.935
To divide a silver is there?

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.635
Maybe just needs save that.

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:56.635
We just want to save it after the image and that's fine.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.900
The next stage is to create a new row.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.230
This is going to be for our massages treatments section,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.570
which is this first row here.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.170
This will have right image and then a unordered list on the right hand side.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.049
Just below this row but we'll add a comment,

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.090
just so it's clear what we're doing here,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.310
this is the closing container.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.500
Just above, we need our div,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.540
class or row and then next inside our columns.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.090
The image is going to be larger than the unordered list,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.400
so I'm going to set this to be a columns wide with call sm-8,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.830
and in fact, for the row we'll also add some margin on the top

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.620
and bottom, add some spacing.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.975
Then inside of our columns we can add our image.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:57.605
The image provided for this one is called the massage.

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:02.050
JPEG, and the old text.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.255
After the wrapper for the images,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:10.475
let's go down and create a second div inside of this row,

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:13.780
and this table is going to be for the unordered list.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.920
We've used to eight columns or rows,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.620
so we can go ahead and use up the remaining four.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.050
We call sm-4.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.160
This is going to take in a unordered list, but first of all,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.385
we need a title in a level four heading,

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:31.890
which is this massages text is here.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.910
Add our h-4 massages as the heading.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.880
Now we can add our Bootstrap classes.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.105
The first one is going to be title,

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.205
title is not a bootstrap class,

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:49.445
this is a custom class which I've added in,

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:52.165
and we'll use this in the CSS soon.

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:57.395
Followed by a bootstrap class of tech center pushes into the middle.

00:04:57.395 --> 00:05:00.065
After this, we can add an unordered list,

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:03.350
which also takes in some classes for styling.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.590
The first one is list group, and after this,

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.495
this group flush, and we'll take a look at what this does in just a moment,

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.430
and then finally, text-light.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.540
I'm just going to add in some sample list items.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.450
The first one is just going to be massage, warn.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.730
The Bootstrap classes for the list item is List Group Item.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.960
Then after this we can add the span tags just after the name,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.925
and we can add a pricing.

00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:46.790
We want to add these in-between the M tags,

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.190
so it's emphasized or Italic and a dash,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.760
and then add a price inside here.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.510
Inside model these albums you can paste in and

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.960
before and go down here and just change the names.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.450
It could be more imaginative if you want,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.560
so I'm just going to go 1, 2,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.220
3, 4, 5, and then take a look at this in the browser.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.890
Over to our project, and then refresh.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.270
We got our image on the left hand side,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.025
it's taken up eight parts,

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.550
and then taken up four parts,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.615
on the right-hand side is our unordered list.

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:25.880
The text is a little bit difficult to see,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.280
but if we highlight this,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.895
we can see is there,

00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:31.865
and we'll do this in CSS in just a while.

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:35.225
Let's move down and create the next two sections,

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:37.220
which is this facial section here,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.520
and then the hair and makeup.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.265
These next two sections, we'll follow a similar pattern to this.

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:46.625
Let's go just above our container here,

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:49.085
and we'll create a similar section to this.

00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:53.130
Let's go and create our div with the class of row.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.785
This is also going to have a margin on the Y axis of four.

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:03.260
Then we're going to do the opposite of what we did here,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.120
rather than having eight columns on the left of

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.580
the image and then four columns on the right.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.635
We're going to do the four comes first,

00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:12.305
so we can add the unordered list.

00:07:12.305 --> 00:07:19.530
So div class of core sm-4,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.170
and then below this inside the row,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.120
we're going to add a second div.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.255
This one is going to be for the eight columns,

00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:30.925
so call sm-8, and then close this off.

00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:33.410
For the first section which has four columns,

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.075
is going to have an unordered list,

00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:36.425
just like we had here,

00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:38.315
and also a level four heading,

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:41.520
lets cut and paste these in.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.279
This one is facials,

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.065
now we can change these text below.

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:51.895
Let's copy this and paste this into each one.

00:07:51.895 --> 00:07:55.070
Just like that, you can change the prices if you like,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.765
but I want to keep it as this.

00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:59.075
Then inside of our 8-column section,

00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:01.255
this takes in our image.

00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:04.310
This image is going to be in the Images folder,

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.890
and this one is called facial.jpeg.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:17.410
Say this, and then over to the browser, reload the projects.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.685
Go down and there we go.

00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:23.180
Again, the images is there, but the text is a little bit difficult to see,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.230
and we'll fix this with a little CSS later.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.080
The third one down is going to follow the similar structure to

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.070
our first row with the image on the left and the links on the right,

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.009
let's go up to our Massage section,

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:46.250
and I'm going to copy this full row and then paste this in just above our container.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.320
First of all, the 8-column section at the top,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.515
the image for this one is cosmetics.jpeg.

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:58.630
We can change the old text.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.740
The text for the heading is Hair and Makeup,

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.940
and then at any text you like into these links,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.109
just paste these in, and that should be it gives a fail-safe,

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:23.110
and up to the browser reload.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.945
There we go, there's our three sections,

00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:32.840
and now we can go over to the CSS and do some styling for this.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.385
Let's go to a custom.css needs go outside of the media query.

00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:46.185
That's added comments, this is the price-list section inside here.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.990
When we had the custom class of title,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.550
I'm going to set its title to be a color of golden load,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.110
and then after this, we can add the list-group-item.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.860
This group item, if we go over to the index page,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.415
this is the class which had been added to each list item,

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:11.230
and what we're going to do here is remove

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.945
this white background image so we can see the text.

00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:20.540
To do this, we need to do is set the background to be known,

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:27.560
and we could also change the font size to be 1.1mz.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.810
Save that, and let's see how this looks.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.810
That's the background now removed for each list item.,

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.550
so we can see our text.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.270
We didn't mention before about this extra class.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.535
If we go up which is list-group-flush.

00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:47.300
So if we remove this from

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.690
the cosmetics and then reload down at the bottom, we'll see the difference.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.210
This has the full border all around,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.245
whereas the rest just have the lines in between.

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:04.470
Lets add this back end and then reinstate our project.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.020
This it now for the section we'll finish up the homepage in

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:15.630
the next video by completing the footer and also adding in our Font Awesome icons.
