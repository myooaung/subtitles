00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.370
We're making good progress with our Bootstrap templates,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.530
and now we've taken care of the homepage.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.390
Now we're now going to move on to the additional pages starting with the blog.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.720
In the last section, we created a link to a blog page,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.915
we have not created any content just yet.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:22.590
If we take a look at the finished site which was just here,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.795
and if we go to one of the blog links,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.330
this is what the blog is going to look like.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.205
We'll have a header section which is going to be the same as the index page.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:37.215
Also the footer, which will also be the same to keep the theme more consistent.

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:42.635
Then the blog is going to consist of our posts on the left in a called container.

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.590
We'll also have some links to the previous and next page,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.555
and also a four column sidebar on the right hand side.

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:52.565
The only content which we'll add at the moment on this page,

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.605
is just to show, it's basically

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:58.400
a template that we could hook up to WordPress with later on.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.335
Over in Visual Studio Code,

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:04.820
we can create the blog to a HTML page.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.610
Let's close this down, and we could do this

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.075
in the root of the project alongside the index.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:15.990
This is going to be called the blog to a HTML.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.220
Pull this out into the root of the project, there we go.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.650
Make sure this is alongside the index and the first thing I'm going to

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.430
do is copy all of the content from the homepage.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.910
Select all, copy and then paste it into the blog.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.220
This will allow us to keep the same footer and header

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.445
sections and we can just delete all content from inside.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:47.380
I'm going to delete just above the footer,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.590
I'd select this container and I've to go all the way up to the closing header tag.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.625
It's quite a bit of content to remove here.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:02.870
There's the header, enough,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.700
and everything just below this header tag here, we can remove this,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.970
give that a save, and then we can see if this is okay in the browser,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.770
and go to our blog and make sure we just have

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.980
the header and the footer area looking like this.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.410
If it always looks like this, we are good to go and we

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.810
can start customizing our blog page.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.955
Let's start with the title,

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:27.310
which is going to be tranquil spot blog.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.845
Then after this, we can also change the feature text.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.150
Instead of a full responsive premium spa theme,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.700
we change it to need to Tranquil Spa official blog.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.130
Just after the break tag,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.450
we can add official blog.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.170
Save this and with the CSS which we've already provided,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.945
there should still be in the center on here,

00:02:49.945 --> 00:02:52.870
so we don't need to do any additional work with this.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.915
The next thing to do is to go down and create a blog container.

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:59.940
Let's do this, just after the header,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.785
we can add a comment.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.425
This is going to be the blog section.

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:08.244
Then this blog section is going to be a fluid container,

00:03:08.244 --> 00:03:11.800
which will be a class on the main element,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.795
is just going to be the main content.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:20.040
Let's construct our Bootstrap classes of container,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.145
dash fluid and also some padding y,

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:26.270
which is the top and bottom.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.120
As ever, we also have a div nested inside with the class of row.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.675
Now this row is going to have two sections.

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.040
As we mentioned before,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.005
when we looked at the final version,

00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:44.360
the left-hand side is going to be a eight column section.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.000
Then later on we'll also create a sidebar to fill up the remaining four columns.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:59.545
Our div with the class of col sm-8 inside here,

00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:02.950
we can construct a pretty simple blog template.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.890
Remember this is just some basic HTML

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.905
which we can adapt to WordPress later on in the course.

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:13.445
A surrounding div for the blog post,

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.060
a level two heading.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.055
Let's add some sample data, so new feature,

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:24.935
then open up the p elements and we're going to add a date the blog post was created.

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:27.660
We can add any date into here.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.485
We'll also got to add the offer,

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:36.140
so we can say this is by and we can add an author's name inside of a link.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.720
I'm going to add my name inside here,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.320
and the link can just have an empty h-ref at the moment.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.095
Again, we'll fix this in WordPress later on.

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:48.520
Then we can add another p elements just below.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.830
Just with some sample date in here,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.035
I'm just typing Lauren and date of the sample text from VS code.

00:04:56.035 --> 00:05:02.520
Let's check this out over in the browser reload and we have our first blog post.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.000
Again, the content doesn't matter at the moment.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.505
We'll be adding all these in using the WordPress dashboard.

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:13.865
The next thing to do just after this date is I'm going to add a small section,

00:05:13.865 --> 00:05:17.645
to display any tags associated with the blog post,

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:22.345
and make sure that the a element is closed off.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:26.735
There we go. Let's create a section just below this.

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:29.310
This is going to be a div.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.560
We can add some padding on the bottom,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.775
and add a class of pb and the value of two.

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:41.200
This will just give this some spacing from the text.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.230
Inside here we can use Font Awesome with the i elements.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.750
This would ride a tag icon.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.140
This should be the solid type with FAS,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.295
and then FA, an icon is called tags.

00:05:55.295 --> 00:06:02.090
Just after this we can add a p elements and it's going to have the text of tagged.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.975
W\ e'll just add some sample tags inside here.

00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:09.840
This again will be generated by WordPress later on.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.370
This little icon in the middle is the tilde.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.085
You may need to look around on your keyboard for this one,

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:19.345
but you can add any icon inside here.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.320
Let's say this. First of all,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.495
we can add a class.

00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:30.650
The inline makes the p elements in line rather than the default or block level.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.415
This will keep the tags that we add in here on the same line as our icon just above.

00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:40.085
Check this out reload the browser.

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:42.170
There's a little Font Awesome icon,

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.665
and then we can have our tags just afterwards in line.

00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:48.200
This is looking very good.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.300
To add some more content, I'm going to copy and paste in this blog post.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.015
If we go to our div,

00:06:56.015 --> 00:07:01.360
which is surrounding all the content here,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.825
copy this in, make sure we're still between the col sm-8 element,

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:10.270
and then paste this in two more times.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.075
To round things off for this video,

00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:16.355
some buttons at the bottom of the posts.

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:19.265
You just infer the older and newer pages,

00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:22.470
just like we have in the finished version here.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.425
Over to our blog, to our HTML,

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:28.660
and just after our last blog post that we added,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.320
the previous and next page is going to be inside of a nav elements.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.290
This nav element is going to be an unordered list with the bootstrap class of nav.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.620
The unordered list will have our two-list items.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.470
The first one is going to be for next page,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.870
and copy and paste this in,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.030
and this one is going to be for our previous.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.145
Then over to the browser reload.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:05.045
There's our links now, we can just add a space in between with HTML entity.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:12.045
Ampersand, non-breaking space, and there we go.

00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:14.070
Our blog is now starting to take shape.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.585
Notice how we've contained the blog post to eight columns wide.

00:08:17.585 --> 00:08:22.920
This will give us four columns to work with for the sidebar, in the next video.
