00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.050
In this finished version here, we can see,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.160
if we scroll down from the latest part of the section,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.345
we have a small About Us section just below.

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:12.615
This About Us section is pretty basic

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.255
and probably something you could complete on your own,

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.370
if you feel confident doing so.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.210
It simply contains our header of About Us,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.835
an image which we've used previously,

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:27.285
along with a row of Lorem Ipsum text.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.655
This is placed in our Index page,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.745
just below the latest offer section we just created.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:36.190
Let's go over to our index.html.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.105
Let's create commands.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.400
This is the About Us section.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.440
We'll also do same, just above as well, in the last section.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.965
This is for the latest offers.

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:55.760
This will just help us later when scrolling up and down.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.680
Onto the About Us section,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.740
this will become fairly familiar now.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.995
We have a surrounding div with the class.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:09.020
I want to again use the container fluid so it spans the full width of the page.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.230
I'm also going to add a value of padding on the top and bottom of five,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.210
positioning texts to be in the center,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.495
and also add a background color of light.

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:27.335
This will offset the value from the dark, which is just above.

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:31.750
Inside this div, we're going to add a familiar row.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.960
To keep things consistent,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.300
we're going to structure the title in the same way as the last two sections.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.235
We do this with a div.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.385
This is going to have a value of col-sm-6,

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:49.510
so it's half the width of the page,

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.860
and then offset this with a value of 3 to push this into the middle.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.400
A level 3 title,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.020
which is going to be About Us,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.275
the image, so the source is going to be in the Images folder.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:10.940
And remember these two different [inaudible] here,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.775
since we're using the lighter background color,

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.550
we're going to use the divider of purple,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.225
alt text of divider is fine,

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:24.430
and then the same class that we used before to give it a weight of 25 percent.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.675
Let's check this out. Give that a save,

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:30.675
and there's our title and the image.

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:36.200
Next up, we just need to create a new row just below for the sample text.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.350
So back over, we have the closing row,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.730
so the closing columns,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.095
and the closing row.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.630
Let's add some space, again,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.580
making sure this is inside of the surrounding container,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.630
div with the class of row,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.225
place this onto a new line.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:56.550
We'll also add some margin on the top.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.080
Separate this from the title with mt and the value of two.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.285
Each row needs to have a div nested inside.

00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:12.665
I'm going do something a little bit different this time and just set this to be col.

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:16.400
If we just set this to be col rather than a value,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.109
each time we add a new col,

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.330
it will take up an equal amount of space.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.100
So if we want to have this one div,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.230
it'll be the full 12 columns.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.690
If we had three divs side by side,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.445
all the same class of col,

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.690
each one will take up an equal third of the page.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.640
Let's add our sample text inside with the P elements and the class of text center.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.130
So there's a couple of different ways of doing this.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.230
If you're using Visual Studio Code,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.840
you can type in the lorem shortcodes,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.910
hit Tab, and then we get some sample text placed in photos.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.705
If not, you can go over to the browser,

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:57.180
and go over to lipsum.com,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.520
and this will give us some sample text which we can generate down at the bottom,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.415
and then copy and paste this into the project.

00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:06.470
Once this is done, and give that a save,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.070
and we can check this out in the browser, and we'll see our text.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.805
In fact I'm going to generate some more.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:18.995
Instead of doing that, we can add more by typing in lorem and then a star,

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:27.345
generate five paragraphs, hit Tab, and that's all we need to do.

00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:30.345
This is the About Us section now completed.

00:04:30.345 --> 00:04:31.940
It was pretty straightforward,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.120
but it gives us a little extra practice using Bootstrap.
