00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.120
At the moment, there is a small issue which may not seem like a problem at

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.605
the moment but this issue will grow as we get a lot more comments.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.755
At the moment, if you take a look at a blog post,

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.320
and I've added three different comments under here,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.715
it will go ahead and click on "Reply" to this first command.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:24.915
The reply box is right at the bottom of all of the comments.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:28.095
This is fine with the number of comments which we have,

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:32.160
but imagine if we clicked on the first comment when it was 50 comments,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.475
then we'll be taking it right down to the bottom,

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:37.730
resulting in a bad user experience.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.250
This is something which WordPress has discovered

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.174
for by allowing us to load up some JavaScript,

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:47.795
place the comment box just under the comments we are applying on.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.005
This is as simple as enqueuing a new script,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.660
just like we did earlier with our bootstrap.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.405
The only difference this time is we're going to load this up inside of an if statement.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:04.685
We don't want this WordPress script called comment reply to always be loaded.

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:09.965
We only want it to be loaded on the single post page if the comments are open,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.915
and also if nested comments are enabled too.

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:18.130
Let's go over to our functions.php.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.670
This will be added up just after our Bootstrap

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.700
JavaScript so we do know [inaudible] scripts function.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.305
Let's make some space,

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:31.240
and then inside here I'm going to begin with a php if statement.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.020
Let's type this out to begin with,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.795
and then we'll talk about what each function does.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.485
First of all, we want to check if is_singular,

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:42.350
and I'm going to add this on a new line so it's more clear.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.240
Then once I had the double ampersands,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.915
I'll also check if the comments are open.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:56.980
Next line, also check if the get option of thread comments is enabled.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.155
If all these conditions is true,

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:06.630
we then want to load our script with WP enqueue script.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.890
The script we want to load is the JavaScript called comment reply.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.905
Comment reply is bundled with WordPress,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.395
so we don't need to add this into our theme,

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.935
so the first thing we're doing is checking if is_singular.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.830
Is_singular is a WordPress conditional tag,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.815
check if this is the single post page.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.950
We then want to check if the comments are open,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.005
which is another conditional tag.

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:35.975
Check if comments are enabled for this post.

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:38.740
This is done inside of the dashboard.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.775
Get option, we'll retrieve an option from the WordPress database.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:49.885
Options are basically pieces of data which it uses to store configuration settings.

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:52.930
Here we include in the thread comments,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.740
and this is a option value to check if nested comments are enabled.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.965
This is important since this JavaScript we're loading

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:04.915
is used to bring the comment box under the nested replies.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:10.760
The option of enabling and disabling comments can be found in the dashboard.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.770
Let's head over there now,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.690
go down to settings,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.260
and then in discussion you will find all the options we have relating to our comments,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.755
such as enabling our nested comments, which you see here,

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:29.435
or making sure users must be registered and logged in to comment.

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:33.870
All that we have to do now is make sure that this file is saved,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.510
go over to our blog section into a comments.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.500
Choose any blog post with some comments,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.775
let's go for the first one,

00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:47.510
click on "Reply," and now this box to

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.170
reply is directly underneath the comment which we clicked on,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.360
and this now leaves our reply box directly underneath the comment we're replying on,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.360
resulting in a much better user experience.
