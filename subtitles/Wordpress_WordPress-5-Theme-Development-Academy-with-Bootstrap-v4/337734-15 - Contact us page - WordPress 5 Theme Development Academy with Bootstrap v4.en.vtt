00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
With our blog, now finished,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.440
we're going to go ahead and create our final page,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.735
which is going to be the Contact Us.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:10.500
If we scroll down, we'll have a link to the Contact Us page here.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.755
We also have a privacy policy link.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.250
But we're not going to be creating this page as

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.685
this would be something specific to your business or needs.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.490
You can go ahead, and create this if you would like.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.735
I'm now going to create this Contact Us inside the roots of our project,

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:31.745
alongside of a blog and index page.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:38.890
Let's create this file, which can be contact.html.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.255
Again, we're going to reuse the same header and footer to keep the layout consistent,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.940
and then create a new section in the middle.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.595
To speed things up we can go to the blog,

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:53.380
copy all the content, and then paste this in.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.405
Just like we did before above the footer section,

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:04.630
let's select from the main container all the way up.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.525
We want to select this just above the block section then remove all these.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.250
You can replace the header section and also the footer.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.180
We can say this and check if it's working okay by reloading the contact page,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.305
which is fine, so we can go and change the title up at the top.

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:29.220
We can change the page title to be Contact Us.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.795
Then the feature text,

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:36.405
let's go down to this section here.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:42.975
We can again use the index.html text which was FULL RESPONSIVE PREMIUM SPA THEME.

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:49.320
Copy this and replace our blog section.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.310
Next we're going to work between the header and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.640
footer section by creating our Contact Us to section.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.255
Let's start with a Comment,

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:01.050
Help us when scrolling up and down.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.660
This is going to have a div,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.530
and this div will be the fluid container for all page.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.875
Then also some padding on the top and bottom a value of five is fine.

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:19.270
Inside here, div with the class of row.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.875
This is going to be the first row inside of our container.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.705
On the finished version,

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.520
if you go to our contact page,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.690
this is just going to be a row which will have the Contact Us title and then the image.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.710
After this, we'll create a form in a second row just below.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.885
This first form, we'll do the same as we did in the index page.

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:48.425
This will be a six column container with a free column offsets,

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:58.400
so col-sm-6, and then provide the offsets about to make this a medium devices called Md.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.710
Then the offset value of three,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.610
level three heading, which going to be Contact Us.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.190
The image for our divider which is

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.155
the images folder and we want to choose the divider purple,

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:26.650
the old text, and then a class of w-25 so it's 25 percent of the width.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.390
Again, if it helps, you can add a comment and this is going to be for the closing row.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.230
Then over to our project in the browser,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.960
and something's not quite right there.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.440
We have our image contacts,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.109
we just need to add a new class of tech center.

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.300
That should do the trick,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.410
reload, and that's it.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.015
Just blow this we're going to add a new row for our form.

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.525
Just have this comment here.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:06.420
This would be a class of row,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.440
and then nested inside here,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.780
we can make our row a 12 column container to make our form a full width for the page.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.920
Open up our div, it's going to be col-sm-12,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.595
which would be the wrapper for our form elements.

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:29.060
We don't need actions since WordPress will be handling this,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.895
but we do need a class.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.025
I'm going to add a class of text left,

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:39.845
and as it sounds, this will align all the texts to the left-hand side of the form.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:42.395
Each input is going to take in

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:47.930
a form group wrapper so bootstrap can control the positioning and layout.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.660
A surrounding div for each input,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.750
a class of form-group.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.235
Each input is going to have a label too.

00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:02.555
This is going to be a text label.

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:05.775
The first one is going to be Your Name.

00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:09.980
We then add the for attribute which is going to be name,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.975
and this will link it to this input which we're now going to create.

00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:16.820
The input is going to be a type of text,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.955
since it's a name field,

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:23.980
a bootstrap class of form control,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.470
the ID and this ID must match this for attribute

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.610
here so the browser knows that this label is linked to this input.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.130
Another benefit of having these linked is

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.565
the user can also click on this label or the text,

00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:47.510
and it will also highlight the input so the user can begin typing in.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.030
A placeholder for the texts of Enter your name.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.910
Before we go any further, let's see how this is looking.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.620
As we said before if we click on this label,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.150
it will also bring the input into focus so we can type in straight away.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.800
Let's do a couple more.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.630
Since the next one is going to be very similar,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.085
we can copy the form group,

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:19.960
paste this in since we are using the same classes.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.630
This one is going to be a label for email.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.129
The text of your email inputs,

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.330
email and the ID too.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.120
We also need to change the place holder to enter your email,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.650
and let's take a look at this in the browser. That's looking fine.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.190
Over in the final version,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.875
we're also going to add a text area at the bottom,

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:50.215
and then a button to send this off.

00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:53.860
The message input is going to be a text area.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.305
Let's add our form group in once more.

00:06:58.305 --> 00:07:02.280
The label is going to be message,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.350
the text of your message.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.820
We can remove the input type of text,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.340
and in place we can add our text area.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.805
I'm going to remove the name,

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:21.990
set the ID to the message to match I will label.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.610
Columns, I'm going to remove but I'm going to set the rows to be

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.340
free followed by a bootstrap class of form control.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.550
The last thing to do just for the closing form tag is to add a button

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.260
so user can send this off with the text of Send message....

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.745
Some attributes, the opening tag,

00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:50.920
this is a type of submit.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.400
Also some bootstrap classes of btn,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.335
then btn-primary to give it the blue color and also the sizing.

00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:05.230
Lets take a look at this.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.440
This is all we need to know to follow Contact Us section.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.520
The final thing I going to do is just check all the links are working okay.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.160
The homepage goes back to the index.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.365
We have the blog page.

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.440
At the bottom of the index page,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.490
we can check the blog works and it does,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.750
Contact Us, I like this here too,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.370
so that's all working fine.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.690
This leaves us now with a great looking bootstrap

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.840
for template to work with for our theme.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.640
I hope you're now excited to move on to converting this template to WordPress.
