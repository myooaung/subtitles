00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.185
Currently we just have a basic Hello World example from the bootstrap starter templates.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.830
When organs change this by adding the top navigation,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.140
it will go to the finished version here.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.530
This is going to be the top navigation bar, which is here.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.850
Over on the left-hand side, we'll have a home link with a site title.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.995
And then on the right we'll have our links.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.600
If we shrink the browser down,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.415
this will be fully responsive,

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:29.510
and this will also dropped down to a button,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.115
which when clicked on it to get our menu links on smaller devices.

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:37.970
Let's start over in the index.html.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.040
The first thing I'm going to do so don't have

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.000
any problems in the Bootstrap CSS,I want to know if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.560
these two attributes of integrity and also the last one of cross-origin,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.985
then bring this back up on the same line.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:57.305
Also the same for the JavaScript at the bottom.

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.870
The one way we linked our minified version,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.435
we can remove the cross origin on the integrity and then give this a save.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:10.120
The next step is to remove our HelloWorld. The sample code.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.695
I will no longer need this.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:15.350
Instead we're going to get started with a header.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.100
Open up the header and then nested inside we have the nav elements.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.135
In nav element is going to contain two things.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.220
First of all, on the left-hand side,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.720
we're going to have the site title,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.065
which you seem for, and then the menu links over on the right.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:38.200
These menu links will collapse in to the drop-down button on smaller devices.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.350
Let's get started by adding these in now.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.180
Let's begin with our link,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.950
which is going to be for the site title of tranquil spa.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.190
This is going to have some Bootstrap classes,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.955
if we save this,

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:54.855
and then check this out.

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:58.249
We can see it's just pretty standard texts at the moment.

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:03.289
Let's start in the nav elements by adding some Bootstrap classes.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.605
The first one is the simple navbar.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.040
If we give this a save and then reload,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.600
we can see this is now moved in from the top edge.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.850
We can see what styles have been applied by going into

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.345
the developer tools with right-click and inspect.

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:25.435
If we then click on the selector and then have over our navbar.

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:29.450
Make sure this navline is highlighted and then on the right we can see

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.345
what styles have been applied by bootstrap from this navbar class.

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:39.525
We can see that it uses the CSS flex box as the display type.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.900
We're also using some padding which moved

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.180
in from the top corner, which we've seen before.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.750
We can add additional classes to this too so just after the navbar, but add navbar,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:59.200
expand-md, give this a save and these styles will apply over the medium sized devices.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.115
If we reload this,

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:03.785
we can see in the media query,

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:09.635
these styles will apply when the minimum screen width is 768 pixels.

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:15.600
If we do shrink this down below 768.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.575
Just a little bit further, we load.

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:23.525
We can see we just now have the navbar applying from before.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.940
We no longer have the second-class applying.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.010
This navbar expand class will set the CSS flexed with the row with no rap,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.000
as we can see here, and justify the content be flexed start,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.300
which is over on the left-hand side.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.865
Then let's add some background colors for this to stand out a bit more.

00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:53.990
Just after this, we can add the navbar light and also bg-light.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.855
We can use any combination of these colors here.

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:58.760
I'm using the navbar light,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.550
which used to be used with light background colors,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.445
and then bg-light to specify the actual light background color of the nav.

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:11.630
If we reload, we can now see this all difference in the background.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.335
Now let's get to work with our link of tranquil spa.

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:18.260
This is going to have a class,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.090
a bootstrap class of Navbar-brand and then we can just add a empty [inaudible] ,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.740
the link to our homepage.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.710
If we now save this and reload the browser,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.795
we now see this applies a style,

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:36.065
color and spacing properties to our link.

00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:39.520
Next up I'm going to create the button,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.980
which is for our drop down menu.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.505
Just a normal HTML button.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:50.499
So inside here, we can add some Bootstrap classes.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:54.590
The first one is going to be navbar-toggle,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.750
and then the type attributes of button.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.800
We're not going to add any text inside here because soon we'll be adding a icon and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.140
this icon is the free lines which you see on the finished version of in the corner.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.970
So the next two attributes which we add the button will be related

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.550
to the small screen and the drop-down content which it controls.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.665
First of all, let's add the data-toggle to be equal to collapse,

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:34.429
and then we can also add the data target,

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:37.805
and we're going to set this to be equal to aid.

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:44.065
So let's add the hash in and call this the navbar nav.

00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:48.230
Here we see a nice data-toggle and we declared we want

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.010
the content to collapse when this button has been clicked on.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.085
But which content do we want to collapse?

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:57.470
Well, if we look at the finished version,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.160
this is going to collapse and expand this navigation menu.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.950
We haven't created this yet, but once we do,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.330
we'll give this AID of navbar-nav.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.945
This data-target can be any CSS selector we want.

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:14.650
So we'll just use it like regular JavaScript.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.610
If you want to target class,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.855
we can use the dot or use the hash for an ID.

00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:24.800
Just before we create the div we want to control by the button.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.210
I'm going to add a span,

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.185
which is going to add in the icons that we just seen before.

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:39.090
The span is going to have the class to add these icons in of nav bar toggle icon.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.960
Let's check this out over in the browser,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.590
and below, down to

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.295
the smallest screen and we now have the button with the free icons from our spun.

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:57.440
If we expand the browser,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.770
we should also see that this button disappears because we've

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.040
added this expand on medium devices.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.375
Now let's create our div follow links.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:12.215
This is going to be the container for our home and

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:16.580
our blog navigation link and it's going to be the container,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.140
which is button toggles open and close.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.240
Let's get to work just below our button.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.360
Let's add our div which is our container.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.200
The first class is going to be equal to collapse.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.485
This is used to hide the content when we need to.

00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:37.474
Next up we have navbar collapse.

00:07:37.474 --> 00:07:42.185
The second bootstrap class will group all the contents together,

00:07:42.185 --> 00:07:47.485
and it will also be used in conjunction with the navbar expand md.

00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:50.195
It knows to hide this container underneath

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:54.215
these breakpoints and the third one is for the CSS flex box,

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:57.620
this is justify contents end and

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.150
this will push our links over to the right-hand side of the navigation.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.860
Inside of this table, we can go ahead and create our links,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.680
which is going to be an unordered list.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.820
Unordered list also takes in some classes are

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.745
the styling and layout and the first one is going to be navbar-nav.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.705
We then add our list items.

00:08:18.705 --> 00:08:24.000
The list items classes are going to be nav item,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:31.175
and then nested inside we have a link by using a elements with the texts of home.

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:33.710
This link is going to have a class of

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:43.835
nav link and then we can set the hate draft to point to our index dot HTML.

00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:48.955
Good, let's copy this and add in one more time for our blog.

00:08:48.955 --> 00:08:52.710
This first list item, paste this in.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.820
This is going to be for the blog and you can also change

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.540
the href to be our blog dot HTML.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.190
Of course, we've not created this,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.920
but we'll get to this in a later video.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.730
So give that file a save and then over to the browser.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.030
Let's reload and expand this.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:16.025
We see on the larger screens we have our home and blog links,

00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:21.800
and then finds to the button is hides the content on these small devices.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.100
But if we click on this button in the top corner,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.485
we don't see the links dropping down.

00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:30.950
This is because if we go to our button,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.265
we set the data target of navbar-nav.

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:37.175
Both not added this to our container.

00:09:37.175 --> 00:09:43.525
Inside this div, let's add the ID of navbar-nav.

00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:50.520
Give this a save, reload the browser and now we get a work in drop-down menu.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.775
Expand this and this now goes back in to the full-screen view.

00:09:55.775 --> 00:09:58.820
Good, so this is it now for the menu,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.500
and we'll continue with the header next when we add the featured background image.
