00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.495
Welcome back. In this video we're going to introduce pagination.

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:09.885
This will allow us to organize our blog post in two ways.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:14.145
First of all, we can break up really long posts into smaller,

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:18.030
more manageable pages, which then have page numbers at the bottom,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.565
which you can click on to skip between them.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.155
Second of all, when we are on the single post view,

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:26.810
we can then add a link at the bottom of the post.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.090
This give forward and backwards to the next or previous post.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.060
Let's begin with adding a pager when we have a really long blog post.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.745
This is a really simple thing to do.

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:40.940
We need to go over to the edit post.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.480
Go into any blog post and then click on edit,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.520
will then take into the edit section of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.945
the dashboard and here we see we have a paragraph of text.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:53.870
If we then click on the plus symbol up at the top,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.885
we can insert a new block for all post.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:00.265
I'm going to do a search for page break.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:03.645
Then click on the Page break just here.

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:07.310
Then we can continue on with our contents which I'm just going to copy

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.775
this paragraph and then add a new block,

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.765
which is going to be a paragraph of text. Paste this in.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.015
Let's do one more. Just below this,

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:18.815
we can add a new block,

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:23.680
add a new page break, copy small text.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.230
Click on the plus symbol to get a new paragraph.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.175
Paste this in. Click on Update to save our changes and then view our post.

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:40.415
We immediately see our first paragraph of text and this is up to our first page break.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.680
But we don't see any page numbers at

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.205
the bottom to skip through to the next page of the content.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:51.140
But this we need to tell WordPress where want these links to appear in our theme.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.390
We want this to appear in the single.php

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.260
file and we're going to use a function called WP link pages,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.570
which I'm going to add just below the content.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.735
For the content function underneath here,

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:09.120
open up the PHP.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.775
Then inside, use the WP link pages function,

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:17.430
brackets just afterwards and a semicolon.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.115
If we now say this and refresh.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:24.685
So good, we now see the page numbers down at the bottom,

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:29.505
which links both from a current page this CSS is a little messed up.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:33.420
Before we fix this, let's just check the rest of the page is working.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.650
We can click on page 2,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.335
which also shows the current page in the URL.

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:41.930
Let's try number 3 and it's all working too.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.215
Before we progress any further,

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:46.015
let's change the CSS.

00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:51.635
This is applying because if we go into the developer tools with right-click and inspect,

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:57.645
let's hover over this current page and this is founded in a span element.

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:02.110
The span elements already has some custom styling from our homepage,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.140
which is for the price section for each one of the office. Let's edit this.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.480
If we go into the sidebar and then down from

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.380
page inside here we have these span elements.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.720
I'm going to add a custom class.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.550
Let's just name this the price.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.490
That's the first one.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.770
We can do this for the second span and also the third one down near the bottom,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.270
give that save and then over to our style.css.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.685
Never need to look for our span, which is just here.

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:43.940
Provenance, we can call this the price with a dot,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.710
since this is a class.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.460
Close these files down, reload.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.440
These are still working okay,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.465
let's check out our blog.

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.385
Click on any of these individual blogs,

00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.745
and go to our free pages and now down at the bottom.

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:03.490
Next pick on a link down at the bottom here,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.855
which is going to be a link to the previous or the next blog post.

00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:10.640
Back over to the single.php.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.270
We have some links down at the bottom which we copied over from our index.php.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.495
These links, if we go to our blog,

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:24.835
these links will cycle through our previous and our next page or blog posts.

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:28.120
We want to do a similar thing for all pages.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.670
All we need to do is to rename this function to be

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.975
post rather than have the S on the end.

00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:38.265
Do that for the previous or next, it's safe.

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:42.825
Then go into any one of our blog posts and as our two links.

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:44.320
We are on blog posts 1,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.275
so the previous one will be our hello world.

00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:50.335
We can then skip forward to blog post 1,

00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:54.530
number 2, number 3, and this all works fine.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.965
This is how we can use pagination on WordPress.

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:04.140
Next we'll continue with the single post view by looking at how we can enable comments.
