00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.995
We know for this course we're going to build in a WordPress theme.

00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:09.125
But what exactly is a WordPress theme?

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:12.480
Well, only official WordPress documentation.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.595
In the what is a theme section,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.675
we can see that a Word Press theme and changes a design of the websites,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.280
and often changing the layout,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.840
which will then change how the end user sees our sights on the front end,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.415
i.e, what a visit disease.

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:32.125
Basically a theme can have different layouts,

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.510
it can use static or responsive layout.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.605
Will be using Bootstrap to create a responsive layouts with various column widths.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:43.200
That generally takes all of other content from WordPress,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.360
well, if that is the page is we've created,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.950
we'll if that any blog post,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.745
any media such as images of videos

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.750
and displays them in any way which we create in our theme.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.815
Going on further down,

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:58.400
themes are made up of some required files,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.515
such as the index.php,

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.050
and also the style.css,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.530
and we'll add these into our theme soon.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.420
We'll also be adding a lot more PHP template files,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.180
we'll also be creating files for Localization,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.415
which is what translating our theme.

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:18.180
Will be used in multiple CSS files and JavaScript to include

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.490
Bootstrap and generally all all the rest of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.685
the contents which we'll need to construct our theme.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.790
If we take a look at the finished side over here,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.115
this is the skin of the theme which we are going to be building for all this course.

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:35.729
It will include lots of Bootstrap columns, rows,

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.380
images and text to create the final version, which you see here.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.659
If we go to the blog section,

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.590
it is going to be all of the blog posts which we'll create in WordPress,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.085
and it's going to loop through them and display them all on this page,

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:52.740
along with our sidebar on the right hand side,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.220
which will allow us to search through these posts.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.830
And also filter by the archives,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.090
the categories, or any tags which will be added.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.194
If we go over to the dashboard,

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:07.624
and then in the theme section,

00:02:07.624 --> 00:02:11.150
this is the Tranquil spa theme which we have activated.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.685
When installing WordPress we also have default themes which come with it.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:20.440
I'm going to activate a different theme called 2019.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.364
Then if we go back to our site and refresh,

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:28.355
we see these same two pages of home and blog.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:30.845
Since it's using the same information,

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.675
which is currently in WordPress,

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:35.305
we'll just create in a different layout.

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:38.070
We also have our same blog posts.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.480
Although a different style and the layout has been applied,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.834
this is the exact same content,

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:46.170
but presented in the different way.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.880
We also have our sidebar down at the very bottom.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.575
These are the same blocks of content which we've created in our theme,

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.415
but just laid out in a different way.

00:02:57.415 --> 00:02:59.910
Back over to the theme section,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.545
let's take a look at one more.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:05.110
This is the 2017 theme.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.055
Let's take a look at this,

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.470
starting with the home.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.320
This again looks completely different.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.914
Although we do still have our same pages,

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:19.820
it has a completely different feel to our original site,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.570
and this is what a theme will do,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.555
clicking on the blog.

00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:27.095
We still see all of the same content,

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:30.620
such as the blog posts which are all listed.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.635
You see these same featured images which were added,

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.200
and also this sidebar on the right has all of

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.990
the same blocks of content just rearranged in a different way.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.840
This is the power we have as a theme developer.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.620
We can create any type of website we want using WordPress,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.945
and this will allow us to create our Tranquil spa website as we go through the course,

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:56.000
along with giving you these skills and knowledge to

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.210
build any type of WordPress website which you would like,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.965
whether that's for yourself,

00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:05.310
or a project, for the business or for the clients.
