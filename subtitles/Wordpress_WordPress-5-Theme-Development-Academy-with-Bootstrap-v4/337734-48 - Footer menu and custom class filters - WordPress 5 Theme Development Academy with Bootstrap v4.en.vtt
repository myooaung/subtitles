00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.980
We already know how to register new navigation menus from

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.360
early in the course when we added the primary menu in the header.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.110
There should be no surprises during this video where we're going

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800
to register the footer menu down at the bottom.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320
The footer menu is still linking it to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.430
the HTML files when we created the boost of version.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.515
Let's go over to the Dashboards and then go down to Appearance.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:32.820
Inside here we have the menus option where we create a new menu.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.850
Let's create this from the create a new menu link and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.825
give this menu a name of a Footer Menu and then hit "enter."

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:46.580
This is an alternative approach to building a menu.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.414
Early on we created the primary header menu using the customizer.

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:54.995
This footer menu has three different links one for the blog,

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:56.615
the contact us page,

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:00.130
and the page we don't have yet called the privacy policy.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.435
Remember this was a page we never created since it's personal to each business.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:08.375
Therefore, we're not going to be creating it in this course.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.130
But we can create a page for it,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.685
for the user to edit themselves.

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:18.315
Let's quickly save this menu and then go to pages, add new.

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:22.150
You can create this privacy policy.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.560
Then publish this page.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.415
Then back over to our menu inside of appearance and menus.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:36.889
Make sure the Footer Menu is selected and then over on the left under the Pages,

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.770
let's add The Blog.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.465
We also want the Contact Us and Privacy,

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:47.100
add all three of these to our menu and let's just rearrange these.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.050
The Blog is at the top,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.205
followed by the Contact Us with Privacy Policy at the end. Give this a save.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:59.285
Next, we need to register the Footer Menu in our functions file,

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:04.130
just like we did earlier with register Nav Menus added to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.680
the functions and then we need to look for our Register Nav Menus function.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.495
We already have the primary menu linked on here.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:17.080
Let's now add the footer,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.930
making sure this comma is at the end of the primary section.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.935
We do this in exactly the same way, just as above.

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:27.280
We first give this a name.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.165
This is Footer Menu.

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:33.140
Then our theme name as a string,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.615
which is Tranquil WP.

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:39.990
Now if we head back over to the Footer Menu in the Dashboard,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.920
there is a term called Manage Locations.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.450
We can select this,Theme Location that we just added of Footer Menu.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.760
We can select our Footer Menu to go in this location and then save the changes.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.015
This new menu is now ready to add to our Themes Footer File.

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:02.135
Using the WP Nav Menu function,

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:08.695
I want to copy the Nav Menu along with enough walker codes we added in the header.

00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:11.535
Let's go to the header.

00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:17.975
We need to copy the Nav walker which is all of this PHP code here.

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:21.890
We can take this over to our footer.php and this will

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.640
allow us to take advantage of all the usual bootstrap classes.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.095
In our footer, just under our navigation header,

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:35.205
I'm going to comment out this on order list for our free links,

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:37.965
then paste in our Nav walker.

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:43.010
We can edit this now. This is the footer rather than primary.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.655
We still have the depth of one's instrument using a drop down.

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:50.580
The container this time is an on order list.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.825
The container class is list group.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:04:00.765
Let's edit this section here, paste this in.

00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:02.420
We don't have a container ID,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.190
so we can remove this line,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.060
the menu class, we can also remove this line.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.635
We then have our Nav walker which is all the same so we can save this file.

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:16.280
These changes were made all apply to the container,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.900
i.e, the on order list rapper with the class of list group.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.430
But what about the individual list items?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.270
The WP Nav Menu function will automatically create our links as LI elements.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.895
It will also automatically add word press classes too.

00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:39.985
But we also need to add our bootstrap class of List-Group-Item.

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:44.105
There is no way we can do this inside of this array.

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:46.880
There are options such as before and after,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.635
which we can use in the array,

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:54.305
where we can add a string to output a list item elements with our own classes.

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:57.770
Since an LI element is automatically added,

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.475
we will end up with the LI nested inside of an ally.

00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:03.680
First, if we refresh the browser,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.530
we can see how our Footer Menu looks.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.310
Reload this on any page.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.650
We'll see our navigation doesn't quite look right.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.394
One way we can fix this is if we go to the Dashboard,

00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:21.225
Appearance and then Menus.

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:25.325
Inside here, if we click on the screen options at the top,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.310
we can add some CSS classes by checking

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.530
this box and this now allows us to add our CSS classes to each page.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.600
If we click on the blog, for example,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.060
we can add the List-Group-Item.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.395
Let's copy this.

00:05:42.395 --> 00:05:46.850
This is the cross which matches up with our list items from here.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.270
We can also do the same for Contact Us and also for All Privacy Policy.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.805
Then save this.

00:05:56.805 --> 00:06:03.280
Then we can reload our blog and our menu links now look like they did before.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.460
Although this is working,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.645
we don't want to rely on the end-user,

00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:12.265
remembering to add this class each time the add new page, the footer.

00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:15.365
We can create a more permanent way of doing this

00:06:15.365 --> 00:06:19.355
using a filter called Nav Menu CSS class.

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:27.365
We can do this over in the functions file and we'll add this down at the very bottom.

00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:30.365
Just before the closing PHP tag,

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:32.675
we create a function.

00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:38.790
This is going to be called a Footer Menu class.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.019
Inside here. This is going to take in three arguments.

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:46.115
This first one is going to be called Classes, which is an array.

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:51.785
This is an array of CSS classes which is applied to the menus list item elements.

00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:56.015
The second one is going to be for the item.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:59.375
The item is the current menu item.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:00.935
Although we don't need to use this in

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:05.635
our particular function and the third one is for the args,

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:09.855
this is an object of WP Nav Menu arguments.

00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:11.420
This will give us access to

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.760
the Theme Location along with over current Menu information if needed.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.069
Inside here we're going to use a PHP if statements.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:27.275
Inside here we want to check the Themes Location and see if it's equal to the Footer.

00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:30.860
We can grab the Themes Location from the args,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.680
then the arrow and then the theme underscore location.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.810
We want to check if this Location is equal to the Footer.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.710
If it is, this code inside the curly braces will run.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.425
What we wants to do, we want to add our bootstrap class to the array.

00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:55.610
$ symbol, classes, which is this argument just here.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.465
We want to set an array item to be equal to

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:07.125
List-Group-Item, semicolon at the end.

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:11.495
Then after this we're going to return our Classes array,

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:14.470
with a semicolon at the end.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.040
Just to recap, we are creating a function which is going

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.080
to check if the Theme Location is equal to the Footer.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.930
If it is, we're going to push to the classes array a string of

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:32.090
List-Group-Item and this will apply to each item in our Footer Menu.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:37.205
Just after this, we'll then go to run our familiar add filter.

00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:40.635
This first argument is the filter name.

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:46.070
The filter name we're going to be using is Nav Menu, CSS class.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.905
Then after this we add a callback which is named of our custom function,

00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:55.090
which is add footer menu class.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.460
Add this in, semicolon at the end.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.895
Then we're going to add two more arguments.

00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:03.770
The first one is a value of ten,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.595
and then the value of three.

00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:10.955
The ten is the priority which the function is run.

00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:13.970
Any lower numbers are higher priority.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.640
I will leave this as the default of ten.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.480
The number three is the number of arguments the function will accept,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.435
which changes from the default value of one since we now passing in three arguments.

00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:29.440
Let's save this and now go over to our Theme.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:37.195
Refresh. We can test this is working by removing the menu classes from our free links.

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:44.564
Lets remove this one from the Contact Us, the Privacy Policy,

00:09:44.564 --> 00:09:52.570
save this and reload and we'll see our classes are still applying to the Footer Menu,

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.225
leaving us with a more permanent solution for this Menu.

00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:59.765
Next we're going to move on to advanced custom fields,

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:05.370
which will really allow our theme to be fully customizable by the user.
