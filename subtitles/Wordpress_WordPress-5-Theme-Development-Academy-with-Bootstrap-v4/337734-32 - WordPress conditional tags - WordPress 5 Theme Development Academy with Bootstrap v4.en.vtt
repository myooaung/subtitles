00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.150
If we look at our original Bootstrap templates which I have opened here,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.925
we have the text of full responsive premium spa theme for WordPress in the header.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:14.700
Then, if we click on the Blog Section,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.925
the text changes to tranquil spa official blog.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.090
Hover back over in our WordPress version,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.674
we just have the same text if we click on both pages.

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:28.605
Since both of these files use our header.php ,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.170
meaning the text is going to be the same.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.265
To fix this, we're going to look at how we can add some custom PHP code into our theme.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.260
This code will detect which page we are currently on,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.840
and then we can conditionally render the text based on the page.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.425
These text is stored in the header.php.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's get to work over there.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.745
If we locate the feature text area,

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.460
I'm going to remove the text from here,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.230
so cut this out, and then in place we're going to add some custom PHP.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.600
This is going to be our own custom PHP function and nothing to do with WordPress.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.550
Let's call this the feature text capital T. We can now set

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.945
this up over in our functions dot PHP, let's head over to here.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.405
Then just after our filter,

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.270
still within the PHP tags,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.355
we can create this function,

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:29.010
which is called the feature text.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.995
Inside the body of this function,

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:37.340
the job is to check if we are on the front page or

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.215
on the blog page and then display the corresponding text.

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:46.340
We can do this with an if statement to first check using the WordPress function,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.545
if the page is the front page.

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:54.484
If it is, we then add some curly braces afterwards.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:57.860
It's front page, is a WordPress conditional tag,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.735
which will allow us to set the text we want for the front page.

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:03.965
Just like this, we can add a underscore,

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:06.620
e, the echo our text.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.540
This is going to be a string,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.715
to add in the quotations.

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.025
I quote the texts out of the header before,

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.835
so we can now paste this back in place.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.990
Let's check this all works over in the browser.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.675
Make sure in the WordPress version,

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:23.640
oops, and we have a error.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.140
Line 43, semicolon again,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.195
save that, reload and there is text on our homepage.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.660
However, if we go over to our blog,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.689
we see that no text is being generated.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.760
This is because we only set the text if the page is the front page.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.485
If it's not the front page,

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:49.235
we can add a never conditional tag called is home.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:53.300
The is home function will refer to the blog post page.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.180
Looking at this in a else-if section,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.570
inside the brackets, we use our conditional tag of is home.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.630
Open up the curly braces and wants to do a similar thing to before.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.020
We're going to echo to the browser and it's acts of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.215
tranquil spa, official blog with a semicolon at the end.

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:18.840
Let's save this and reload.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.020
Our text of tranquil spa official blog is now showing on the blog page.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.855
If you are new to, if else statements they will run the code inside of the curly braces.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:33.830
For example, if is from page returns true,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.250
then the text inside of these curly braces will run.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.200
If we're not on the front page,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.710
you will then fall back to the next section, which is elseif.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.115
Check in if the page is home and then it will run

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.745
the code inside of the set of curly braces instead.

00:03:49.745 --> 00:03:55.235
We can also add multiple elseif sections and we'll do this later on in the course.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.335
Finding out at the very end,

00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:59.585
if none of these conditions met,

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.485
we can add a final L section.

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:07.760
This will act as a fallback if none of the above two conditions are met.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.310
If not, we're just going to echo to the screen

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.885
the standard text that we have on the homepage.

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:17.345
Paste this in and this will work for things such as

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:22.925
a follow four-page or any of the pages which we don't set the custom text.

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:27.110
We will keep adding to this function as we create more page templates,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.120
both analysis, all we need.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.090
Next we'll move on to our single page templates.
