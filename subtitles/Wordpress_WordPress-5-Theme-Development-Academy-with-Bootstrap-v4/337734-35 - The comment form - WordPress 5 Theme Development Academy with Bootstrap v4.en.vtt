00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.520
A common feature when working with a blog is to have a comment section below each post.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.970
This allows our readers to comment or ask questions about

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.285
the post and also others can reply and comment too.

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:21.345
The comments functionality will be added over the next couple of videos.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:25.775
This video will concentrate on adding the actual form input

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.885
and then the next one will be the code to display the comments under the blog post.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.550
For the comments, I'm going to add a new file which is called the comments.php.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.830
This is going to be in the roots of the project,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.770
alongside the rest of the page templates.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.790
Create the comments.php, add PHP tags at the top for our comments,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:57.930
close this off with the text of the template for displaying comments.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.375
WordPress has a built-in function which will display a standard comment form,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:08.495
this is called the comment on the skull form.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.330
Since this is a PHP function,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.800
you need to open up the PHP tags.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.260
Then this is called the comment on the skull form.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.760
We'll give this file a Save and then open up our single.php file,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.855
reload any blog post.

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:29.635
We don't see any new content added to this page.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:35.450
Under this cause, we need to setup where we want the form to appear in this template.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.955
We can add this over in our single.php.

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:45.725
Lets go just above the nav section for all pages, the PHP tags.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:49.855
Inside here we're going to create a PHP if statement.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:53.675
Inside here, this is going to check two things: First,

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.620
we're going to check if the comments are actually open.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.840
Then we use the operator,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.565
which is the two pipes.

00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:06.695
The second condition is to check if we have at least one comment available to display.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:11.700
We do this with the WordPress function called get_comments_number.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.900
Then need colon at the end where we add the content,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.260
which you want to display is this condition is true,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.990
the content we want to display is the comments template.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.955
This comments template will default to our comment.php file,

00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:32.140
which we've already created.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.545
Let's check this out over in the browser.

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:41.090
Has syntax error on line 52 of the single,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.600
we just need to add if at the end to close off our if statement.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.185
Displayed is the standard WordPress command form.

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:58.755
We leave this in the default state

00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:02.870
or we can also add arguments to this comments form the customize,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.315
including some bootstrap classes to make it fit in better with the rest of our theme.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.060
In the comments.php file,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.055
we can set up an array of values to customize each field in the form.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:18.965
Let's add these just above the comment form.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.740
We can create a variable with the $ symbol,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.705
which I'm going to call args.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:27.390
Set is to a PHP array.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.355
We can then pass in our arguments into our command form.

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:36.170
This will take effect and add a semicolon at the end.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.410
Before we add in our arguments,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.810
let's take a quick look at our form.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.500
I'm going to begin with customizing this form at the very top,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.125
which is the leave a reply text.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.810
All of these modifications are done by making

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.395
changes to the default parameters in our array.

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:59.285
If we go over to the WordPress website and take a look for the common form section.

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:03.880
This will show us all of the available parameters which we can change.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.520
If we scroll down to the parameters section.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.160
At the moment we're working with the title.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.440
We need to target a field called title underscore reply.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.335
If we search for this,

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:17.300
which is this field just here,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.820
this is a field we need to customize the title of the comment form.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.400
Making this the first argument we need to add in title, underscore, reply.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.585
Then a arrow operator,

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:34.010
which is the equal symbol,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.390
and then the right arrow.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.150
We can then set the new title to be reply or

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.325
comments or you can customize this to any text you prefer.

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:50.060
This arrow operator when used in PHP with an array,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.485
is basically used to set the value on the right hand side to the key on the left.

00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:59.885
Then go to our project and refresh.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.795
We've now changed the title of the form.

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:05.270
We can also add some Bootstrap classes to add

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.585
some space in on the top and bottom of this title.

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:12.685
We can do this by adding a div inside of our string.

00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:19.320
A Bootstrap class or title reply a value of three,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.810
then close off our div,just afterwards,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.850
it reloads and there's our space it in at the top and bottom.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.035
Next we can move down to our common section,

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:31.700
which is this text area.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.605
For this, we use a field if we go to our reference called comment on the skull field,

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:38.120
which is this one just here.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.025
This is to set the text area and the label of the comments body.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:49.325
In our arguments makes you add a comma just after our title reply.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:52.860
We can then target these common fields,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.965
setup our arrow and then our string.

00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:02.315
To make this more clear, I'm going to add this on multiple lines,

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:05.125
starting off with a div section.

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:09.280
We can add Bootstrap classes just like we did above,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.150
this is going to be the form group class.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.215
Then we can define a label if four attributes,

00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:22.180
this is going to be for comments,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.900
the text of comments,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.815
then close off our label.

00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:34.080
Then a break tag to add this onto a new line.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.950
Next up, we have our text area,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.750
the opening and closing tags.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.070
Inside the opening tag,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.480
we can add our attributes.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.660
The ID is going to be equal to comments.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.730
Tomato put the label,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:58.260
the name of comment two the Bootstrap class is going to be formed control.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.320
Then finally on the last line,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.650
this is going to be to close off our div,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.725
so the file was well project and reload.

00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:13.105
Good. This text area now fits in better with our theme.

00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:16.700
Next, we also have this submit button at the bottom.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.380
Very soon I'm also going to come back and create a name and email field.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.695
Who will do this later since this is a little bit different.

00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:27.755
This one is target, the submit button.

00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:30.820
Just after our string we can add a comma.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.170
This is for the Submit button,

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.575
so Submit on the skull button.

00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:40.595
Setup our arrow, then as a string,

00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:46.920
we can add our Bootstrap button with the type of submits.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.560
The bootstrap classes of btn, btn-primary.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.465
The text to display on a button of

00:07:56.465 --> 00:08:00.530
submit and then close off our button writes at the end.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.080
Still within a string add a comma,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.925
hit "Save" then reload,

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:09.695
now as our Bootstrap classes now taken effect.

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:13.895
Next I'm going to add a name and email field.

00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:17.575
If we head back over to the documentation for the common form,

00:08:17.575 --> 00:08:20.835
then what we want next is this field value.

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.660
This is going to be for the input fields of offer,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.435
e-mail, URL and cookies.

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:30.830
To work with this, we need to setup the field array nested inside of

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.795
our arguments is field array also makes use of the comment form.

00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:38.960
Default fields hook to apply filtering,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.820
so back over to the comments of PHP we can now see this inaction.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.470
Your stuff that our button,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.560
make sure there's a comma at the end.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.195
We can ask our fields.

00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:52.560
Set this up just like before,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:59.149
but this time we're going to apply on the skull filters at the brackets.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:03.800
The first parameter inside of our filter is the name of the filter hook,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.730
which we've seen before as common form default fields.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:14.605
Add this as a string, comment form, default fields.

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:20.430
Then the second parameter is our array of fields which you want to filter.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.940
Inside of this array, we can add the offer e-mail,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.930
URI or cookies, which we've seen before.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.365
In our case so we only want to target the offer and the e-mail.

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:37.950
Let's begin with the offer as a string.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.455
This is an setup just as we did with any other field just above.

00:09:43.455 --> 00:09:47.270
Let's add this as a string and make some space.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:54.330
Need a surrounding div with the Bootstrap classes or form group.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:01.260
Next I label, close label of two.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.665
We can add our attributes inside.

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:05.915
The first one is going to be four,

00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:11.760
this is for the offer with the text of your name.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.080
Then I'll form inputs,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.610
this will have the ID, which is going to be author,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.010
after the link we have label,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.720
the name of offer,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.240
this is a type of text.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.915
Then finally the Bootstrap class of form control closes off.

00:10:36.915 --> 00:10:40.040
Then we also need to close off our surrounding div.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.740
Next stop is the e-mail,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.560
which is going to be another item on our array.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.180
So I'm going to copy the off section, add a comma,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.490
and then paste this in just below,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.340
this one is going to be for the e-mail,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.585
let's copy this email section.

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:02.465
We have these round and div is going to be the label for email,

00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:06.905
text of your email, input Id,

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:12.465
changes, the name and also the type.

00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:17.420
Save this file and then over to the browser into our projects.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.555
We see just underneath our comments and submit

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:24.005
that we don't have this name and email section showing.

00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:28.930
This is because these fields don't need to be displayed when we currently logged in.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.440
We currently logged in as tranquil admin,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.850
so we'll click on log out.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.610
This is how the form looks for non logged in users.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.625
So we're going to add in the name and e-mail too.

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:44.585
The next stage is to add the start to the required fields.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:48.500
I'm going to add this to the comments, offer and e-mail.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.345
First of all, up to our text area for the comments in the label,

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.655
which means add a star,

00:11:55.655 --> 00:11:59.180
then the offer, so just after your name.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.945
Then the e-mail at the bottom,

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:05.385
that's your checklist is working with a reload,

00:12:05.385 --> 00:12:08.450
this is now for part one of the comments.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.220
In the next video, we will look at how we can

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.470
actually display the comments on the screen.
