00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.195
Just like we looked at earlier when adding pagination for our list of blog posts,

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.480
we can also add this feature for comments too.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.365
To this, I'm going to add five comments on any blog post.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.690
Let's go for the tests.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.960
Test one, "Submit", Test two, "Submit". Test three.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.905
Leaving these five comments on this particular post.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:36.319
Now if we go over to the "Dashboard" then to "Settings" and then "Discussion",

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.735
just for demonstration purposes,

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:42.490
I'm going to reduce the number of comments per page to be two.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.205
If you look for the option to break comments into pages,

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:52.080
we can change this to be two, save our changes.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.795
Then if we go back to our sites,

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:56.715
my Amazon blog post free.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.240
Let's head over to there, click on this.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.160
We still see there is a single comment showing on this blog.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.025
We did set this be a maximum of two,

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:12.350
but this is the last page of comments so we see the comment number 5 on its own.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.565
Comment one, two is on a page,

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:16.250
three and four is on a page,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.610
even this number 5 on its own as the pages.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.245
We can skip between these.

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:26.740
This is as simple as adding a WordPress function called the comments navigation.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.870
We can add this over again in our comments, dot php file.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.045
We're going to add this just above our if statement that we added in the last video.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:37.435
Check if the comments are open.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:41.090
We already have the PHP tags so I'm gonna add this nested

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.650
inside as the WordPress function called the comments navigation,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.270
semicolon at the end,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.740
hit "Save" and then over to the browser and reload.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.040
We now have a title of comments navigation.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.605
We can click on the older comments, to go back,

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:03.215
and now when we have a page, back and forward,

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:06.520
we also have the older and newer comments link.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
This default text of comments navigation is added for screen readers.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.190
This text along with the text used for older and newer comments can

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.020
also be changed by adding in parameters into the comments navigation function.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.910
If you would like to do this, check out

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.255
the WordPress function reference in the documentation,

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:29.240
and you'll see some examples of how you can do this.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.050
I'm going to leave this as the default text for now as it is pretty clear.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.480
This is it now for our comments so now see you in the next section.
