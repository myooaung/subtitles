00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.130
Part 2 of this comment section will be to actually display

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.030
any comments which had been left underneath the blog post.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
This again will be in the comments/PHP file.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.045
Let's begin inside of there.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:20.835
We start at the top by first checking if they couldn't post is password protected?

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:24.345
If no password has been entered by the current visitor,

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:29.145
we can exit by returning before we load up any of the comments.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.035
Let's do this up at the top,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.175
just above our array.

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:36.275
Let's add a PHP if statements.

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:39.780
We are going to check if the post is password protected with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.720
a WordPress function called post_password _ required.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.560
If the post is password protected,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.810
we're simply going to return without loading up any of the comments.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.740
With this check in place,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.300
we can go below.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.095
Just after this, we're going to create a section for our comments,

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:02.480
which is just regular HTML.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.095
Therefore, we need to close off the PHP just above,

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:09.860
and then restart it just afterwards.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.495
Inside here we're going to check if any comments exist,

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:17.090
so PHP will do this in a if statements.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.810
We can check if any comments exist first with a WordPress function called have _comments,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.460
a colon at the end then closes off.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.370
We also need to make some space,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.250
and then add a endif section at the end.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.360
If comments do exists,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600
the code inside the here will run.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.245
I'm going to add a level two heading with some padding, so h2,

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:53.025
a bootstrap class, which is going to be to equal to py-3, close off our heading.

00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:57.580
Rather than add coding in a static title as a heading,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.785
we're going to make this dynamic using PHP,

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.030
so let's open up and close the PHP inside.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.205
This heading is going to be dynamic and change for the number of Blog posts.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:15.290
For example, it may say something such as free comments on a Blog post 1,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.520
and then the number will increase for each comments.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.745
If we do have comments we want to know how many,

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:28.110
we can access this information using the WordPress function called get_comments_number.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.240
Then we're going to store this inside of a variable,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.465
which we do with a dollar symbol prefix,

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:38.905
and then I'm going to call this variable the number_of_comments,

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:44.455
separated by underscores, and set this equal to get_comments_number.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:49.025
We can now use this variable to alter the text this heading will display.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.275
If we only have one comment,

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:55.000
we want the text to display as one comment as a singular.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.410
If there are multiple comments, however,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.705
we need to display the plural version,

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:02.960
such as six comments with the s at the end,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.980
this can be achieved using a conditional if else statements.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.565
Just below our variable,

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:11.865
let's add if section,

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:13.670
and we'll say number_of_comments,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.980
which is the variable we created above,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.100
is going to be equal to the value of one.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.265
We'll run this code inside,

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:24.965
else we'll run the code inside of this next section.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:28.880
This if and the else block will both be used to add a title

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.975
but using the singular or plural version, which you mentioned before.

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:36.900
These texts can be displayed using printf,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.530
which will output a formatted string and I want to add this to both blocks.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.690
We'll use printf because it allows us to insert variables into our text string,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.895
which we'll look at in just a moment.

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:54.890
Inside of these printf brackets,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.190
I'm going to add a WordPress function as the first parameter,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.260
which is for the format,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.250
or in other words, the text which you want to use.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.675
Later on in this course, we'll look at how we can add

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:08.665
the ability to translate the text in our field,

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.650
so some of these may make a little bit more sense later on,

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.660
but for now I'm going to surround the if statement section with the _x function,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.960
and this will take in three parameters.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.710
Let's begin by adding in the first two required parameters,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.085
then I will explain what these mean.

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:32.975
The first one as a string is the text of one comment and then on.

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:36.710
After this we're going to add some HTML entities so &ldquo;

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:48.950
and then the &rdquo;,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.015
separated by a comma.

00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:53.815
The second one is going to be the text of comments title,

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:57.035
so let's start with the first parameter,

00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.775
which is this line just here.

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:02.630
This is the string of texts which will display in our theme.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.310
It will also be a string which we can translate later in the course.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.000
We end this string with

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.460
the left double quotation mark and also the right double quotation mark here.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.195
These HTML entities which are the safer way of adding in symbols into our websites.

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:22.730
In fact, this is how it will display on the websites,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.125
such as one comments on then the quotes,

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:30.065
line two, which is this one just here.

00:05:30.065 --> 00:05:33.805
This is the context information for translators.

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:35.300
Then later on in the course,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.545
we'll add a third optional parameter when translating our theme.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:41.570
Between these double quotations,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.910
we also want to display the post title,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.065
so this would say something like one comment on a blog post 4.

00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:50.855
Remember before we said by using printf,

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:53.750
it allows us to output a formatted string.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.125
Well, this allows us to add variables into our text.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:01.795
We can add a variable by adding a percent symbol followed by a value,

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:03.740
so just the letter s,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.700
which means we are expecting a string value.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.510
Between the quotes, add a percentage symbol,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.145
and then a s, and this is going to be where we all put our variable.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:18.655
But where do we get the value from to insert?

00:06:18.655 --> 00:06:23.500
We get this by adding a second parameter to our printf function,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.160
so just after these x add a comma,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.420
and then we can add a WordPress function called get_the_title.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.250
This function will grab the post title and add it into

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.610
the string in the place of our percent symbol and then

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:46.470
s. If I could just add a semicolon just after the printf down to the else section,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.140
this section will also display similar text or both,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.830
but this can also support text which is a singular or plural form.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.440
To support this, rather than using the _x function,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.360
we use the function called _nx as the first parameter.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.700
Again, let's first write this all out and then I will explain just afterwards.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.965
The first one is going to be a string,

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:19.635
so the %1$s comment on,

00:07:19.635 --> 00:07:23.640
and then we can add just afterwards our left and right quotations,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.980
so these are the HTML entity codes of &ldquo with a semicolon at the end,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.880
and then the right quotation,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.950
which is the &rdquo and a semicolon.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.280
In between these two, we also need to add our variables, so %2$s.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.540
I know this looks a little strange,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.310
but just bear with me for now.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.790
I'm going to add a comma then copy and paste this line,

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.820
and then all we need to do is add a s on the end of comments.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.990
Starting with the first line,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.880
let's explain what's going on here.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.730
This first line or this first parameter of

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.870
our nx function is the singular string of text.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.010
The second line is the plural version of the same text,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.250
ie, with the S on the end of comments.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.845
These strings also have the left and

00:08:18.845 --> 00:08:24.865
the right double quotations on the outside of here with our variables placed inside.

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.855
After this we can add a third parameter,

00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:31.180
and this will be the number to compare to decide if we're

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.360
using the singular or the plural version of our text.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.660
We already have a variable of number of comments,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.860
so we can add this in with dollar symbol, number of comments.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.300
If this variable is equal to one,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.040
so we only have one comment,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.015
it will run the singular version with the word of comments.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.730
If it's more than one, it will not the second line which

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.615
will say the word of comments in place.

00:08:58.615 --> 00:09:02.660
If both parameter, which we can also add into this nx function,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.850
is the context information for

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:10.530
translators unless it's going to be a string of comments title,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.300
and this will appear in the translation software we'll use later.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.790
You will have noticed we have to placeholders this time in our strings.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.530
As we all know from before,

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.570
this begin with the percent symbol,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.765
and then we have a value of one and also two.

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:32.420
These values are inserted by adding a second and third parameter or printf,

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.700
so just after nx function,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.355
we can add a comma.

00:09:36.355 --> 00:09:39.710
These variables are inserted in order so

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.820
the first one we'll add here will go into the place holder number 1,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.875
which is the number_of_comments.

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.500
Again, we already have this stored in the variable of

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.750
number_of_comments to enable this number to be localized or translated later.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.510
We'll wrap it in a function called number_format _i18n.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:07.590
Let's type this out, number_format_ i18n,

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.985
open up the brackets,

00:10:08.985 --> 00:10:13.200
and then at the end we can close off the bracket to surround our variable.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.360
If you've not seen i18n before,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.045
this is a shorthand version for internationalization,

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:23.570
so rather than tying out the full 20 character word,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.015
sometimes you use the shortened prefix,

00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:28.475
so it's i, 18 characters,

00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:30.870
and then n separated by a comma.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.040
We can add in the second value for the second variable,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.365
this is going to be the page title.

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:42.220
We can do this through WordPress function called get_the _title, close this off.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.360
Now, if we give this a save,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.650
and then reload the browser,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:53.235
so we have an unexpected closing curly brace on line 38,

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:57.430
so we just needs to add a semicolon at the end of printf.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.130
Reload and now this removes any errors from our comment form.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.750
The next stage is to add a WordPress function to display our comments.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.855
I'm going to do this in the comments form just underneath the level two heading.

00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:18.980
We're going to create a ordered list to display these,

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.030
then close off ordered list below.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.825
This will be generated by WordPress,

00:11:24.825 --> 00:11:28.185
so we needs to add this in as a PHP tag.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:34.120
The WordPress function which we're going to add is called wp_list_comments.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.490
List comments takes in an array where we can pass in some settings we want to add.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.975
The default style which we can add in here is the unordered list,

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.010
but I want change his to be ol,

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.010
separated by a comma.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.550
We can also set the size of the avatar,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:57.080
which you want to display, with avatar_size.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.185
This is then equal to a pixel value,

00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:02.860
which I'm going to set to be 70.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.005
WordPress along with many other websites,

00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:10.415
will grab your avatar image from a site called gravatar.com.

00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:14.060
So if you've uploaded an image to this website in the past,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.300
this will then display on WordPress.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.845
Now, if we save this and then go over to the site,

00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:22.794
I'm going to go to the admin section,

00:12:22.794 --> 00:12:28.040
the first login, add the username and password,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.480
and let's check this box to login.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.494
Go to the sites, the blog section,

00:12:37.494 --> 00:12:40.070
and choose any blog post,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:46.200
that's either a random string of text as a comment and hit "Submit".

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.915
Good, let's try one more.

00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:52.680
So comment 2, hit "Submit".

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.955
Great. So now all our comments are working.

00:12:55.955 --> 00:12:57.215
In the next couple of videos,

00:12:57.215 --> 00:13:00.220
we'll make some more improvements to our comment system.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.450
So I will see you there.
