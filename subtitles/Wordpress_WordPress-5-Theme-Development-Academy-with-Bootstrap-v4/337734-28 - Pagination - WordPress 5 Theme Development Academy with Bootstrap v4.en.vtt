00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.500
We're going to be concentrating on adding

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.475
an important feature called pagination to our blog page.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.260
At the moment, we only have three individual blog posts,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.510
which is four with the sample one.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.325
But if we had hundreds of blog posts,

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.815
this page would get really long.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:25.260
Pagination allows us to split the posts up into separate pages.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
We can then click on some previous and next buttons to cycle through all of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.980
our posts over in the index.php from our bootstrap templates,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.980
we already have our links for next page and previous page,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.310
so we're going to do two things in this video.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.915
We're first going to replace our previous and next page text

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:49.510
with some WordPress functions to provide the functionality for this to work.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.810
We're also going to remove this outside of the loop so in the L section,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.750
we only have the text down at the bottom.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.270
Therefore, let's begin by cutting out our nav section,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180
with our unordered list,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.015
and also the closing div at the bottom,

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.375
so put this out of place.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:11.030
Then this is going to go just after the endif section,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.265
which is the end of our loop.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:20.230
Down here, we can paste this in and just indent this back.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.930
Okay, let's start with the next page.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.435
We're going to replace this text with a PHP function.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:30.700
Open up PHP and then we're going to use the WordPress function

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.755
called next_posts with an s and then link,

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:38.300
semicolon at the end.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.690
Then we're going to replace the previous page with a very similar WordPress function.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.970
This will be previous posts link,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.665
separated by the underscores,

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.345
semicolon at the end,

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:56.805
and then close off the PHP.

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:59.925
Save this file, and then over to the browser.

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:02.045
Let's reload the page.

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:04.730
Now if we scroll down to the bottom,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.470
we still see our blog posts,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.790
but we don't see our buttons for the previous and next page.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.735
This is because we don't have enough blog posts to actually create the pagination.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.395
We can go over to the Dashboard,

00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:21.550
then go down to Settings.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.755
In the reading section we need to look out for the blog pages, show at most.

00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:29.165
We have this set to be 10 posts,

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:33.380
so we won't create a new page until we have 10 or more posts.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.110
To see this in action, let's reduce this down to five, save the changes.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.675
Now we can go ahead and create some new blog posts.

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:45.380
I have 1, 2, 3.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.450
Let's create number four.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.220
Copy the sample text, paste this in.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.730
We can add some tags into here.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.460
Publish this one. Blog post

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.430
five, some sample texts.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.535
Let's go for one more, we'll do number six,

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:26.535
blog post 6 paste this in and publish.

00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:31.160
Now we can check out our sites by visiting the blog page.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.285
We have number 6, 5,

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:35.340
4, 3 and 2,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.020
so that's five blog posts on there.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.285
Now we have the next page link.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.715
If we click on this,

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:44.710
we have the blog post 1 and also our hello world example.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.250
We can also click on previous to go back.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.110
This will stop our blog page from getting really

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.440
long when we have lots of individual posts.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.890
This is how we can add a pagination to our theme.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.710
Next we'll take a look at using filter hooks.
