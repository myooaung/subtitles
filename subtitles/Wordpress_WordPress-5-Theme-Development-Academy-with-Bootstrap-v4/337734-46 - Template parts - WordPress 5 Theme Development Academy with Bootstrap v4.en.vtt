00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.495
As our WordPress theme grows,

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:08.250
it makes sense to organize our code into a more organized and maintainable way.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.990
Using a template part will allow us to do this by taking parts of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.775
our templates or our code and then placing them into their own file.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:20.880
Just like we did with the header and footer areas,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.070
we can then reuse these template parts in multiple parts of our theme.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.345
This is a really useful way to avoid any code repetition.

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:34.275
A good use of this would be our comments.php file.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:37.650
We can move the comments form into its own file to keep things

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.415
more organized and also the file size down.

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:44.130
To also help with this organization,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.855
I'm going to create a new folder to keep these in called template-parts.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:52.550
So in the roots of the project are the new folder this time.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.570
This is called template-parts.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.855
Then inside of this folder we can create a new file and this is called

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:04.785
the custom comment form.

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:07.950
This also needs the dot php extension.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
Let's add a php comments at the top of this file.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.770
Close this off. Then inside here we're going to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.660
add a comment of template part for displaying our customer comment form.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.515
So now over in the comments.php,

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:36.515
we're going to cut out the comment form at the bottom of the file.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:44.450
Let's head over there now, comments.php and scroll down to our custom comments form.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.895
So this has its own arguments,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:48.590
which we're also going to add.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.680
Let's cut the PHP tag right at the very bottom.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.985
Then up to the PHP tags just above our array cut this out,

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:05.110
save our comments.php and then we can place this inside of our new template part.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.325
So save this file and the next step is to add this back into our comments file.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:14.315
We can do this with a function called get template part.

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:20.230
So let's start this off with the php tags. Close this off.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.030
Then inside here we can use the WordPress function called get template part.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.990
Inside here this takes in a string and the string is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.935
the file part to the template part which was created.

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:36.410
So from the root of our projects,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.815
we added a new folder called template parts.

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:44.190
Then the filename is custom comment form.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.230
We don't need to add the dot php extension.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.100
So now save this and we can check this out.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.400
Let's go to our blog.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.660
Now we can click on any of these blog posts and we can try to create a comment.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.540
Let's click on "Reply here" so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.750
new comments submit this and everything appears to be working as normal.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.915
So this is a technique you can use for any part of your code,

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.495
particularly if the code is to be reused,

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:22.140
or if you want to break up any larger files into small pieces.
