00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.735
To round off this 'latest offer' section,

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:06.960
we just need to apply some custom CSS.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.125
This is going to be many for the 'pricing' section,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:11.655
which is up at the top here.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.510
I'm going to make it look just like the final version on here,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.555
what is positioned at the top of the card.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.505
The code we're going to be writing,

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:23.010
which is going to be standard CSS,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.890
which is not going to be provided by Bootstrap.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.615
This is not a problem though,

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:32.040
as a WordPress theme can be made up of any HTML and CSS.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120
Regardless if it is using Bootstrap, regular HTML,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.775
or any other framework for that matter,

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:44.720
our price we created in the last video is surrounded in a span element.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.770
Let's go up, and this is the one we can see just here.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
We can tag this over in our CSS.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.755
We're going to be doing this in our custom CSS file,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.380
and we'll begin down in the media query.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.635
So this applies to the larger screens,

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:03.065
that our feature background.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:09.650
Let's tag the span elements, and first of all,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.700
we can take out the normal flow of the documents by adding a position of absolute,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.780
and I am going to create the background,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.175
which is going to be for the circle which surrounds it.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:23.160
We can add some transparency,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.955
this will be an rgba value of 175, 169,

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:33.535
169 and the alpha value of 0.6,

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:36.490
which is 60 percent,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.870
we are also going to make this into a circle.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.580
We can begin by adding a height of 80 pixels and also a fixed width of 80 pixels too.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.810
So our price is positioned in the center.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.105
We are also going to add the line height,

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.680
and this is also going to match,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.964
this is going to be 80 pixels.

00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:59.000
Then to create our circle,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.340
we're going to add the border radius,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.450
and we can do this by adding this as a value of a 100 percent.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.805
Before we go any further, let's see where we're at with this,

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.210
so our project and reload.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.410
There's our circle with the background with

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.905
a 100 percent border radius to make it round and a fixed width and height of 80 pixels.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:30.760
The next stage is to position this in the center and over the top of the card.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.920
Now, to push this into the center,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.780
because this is absolute references from the closest relative container,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.720
which is this div just here.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.980
So we're going to set this to a value of negative 40 on the top left,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.580
therefore positioning this in the center of the Cordova.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.060
Lets add a top value of negative 40 pixels,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.885
and the same for the left,

00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:03.210
negative 40 pixels, and let's see how this leaves us.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.045
Now this pushes this into the top corner.

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:08.195
Since this is a width of 80,

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:11.230
we've offset the value by 40 pixels.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.805
We've got the vertical alignment will need,

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:18.215
and now we just need to push it across by 50 percent and we can achieve this with

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:24.110
some margin left of 50 percent,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.950
and there we go.The final step is just to increase the font size to be 1.8 rems,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.130
and then we're good to go, 1.8 rems,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.640
both the browser and there we go.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.430
If we shrink down the browser,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.425
we can see how these sections look on the smaller devices.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.695
Let's go down to the mobile size,

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:50.375
these sections look a bit close together on the top and bottom,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:55.660
so we can add some margin to the bottom of each card outside of the media query.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.220
Let's scroll up. Let's do this just about the 'Welcome section'.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.975
So it applies to all the cards, including these ones,

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:13.780
dot card, add some margin on the bottom of 20 pixels, reload.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.900
We can now see the spacing in between each one.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.720
The last thing we need to do is to reset the margin back to 0 for this larger view,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.560
we need to do this back inside the media query below our span,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.390
again, tag the cards.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.660
All we need to do for this is to set the margin on the bottom to be a value of 0.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.830
Good work. The Bootstrap template is beginning to take shape, so keep going.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.560
Next we'll get to work with the, 'about us section'.
