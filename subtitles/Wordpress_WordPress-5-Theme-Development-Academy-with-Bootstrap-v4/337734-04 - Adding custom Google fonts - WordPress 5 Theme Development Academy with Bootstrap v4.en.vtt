00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.215
Since we are creating our own custom theme,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:08.475
we are free to make use of any type of font which we would like.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.180
I'm going to make a news of a Google font in his theme,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.495
and you can of course choose any of those which you prefer.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:17.745
You can have a search for Google fonts,

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:21.765
or you can head over to fonts dot google.com.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:26.090
Take a look through these and select any which you prefer for the theme,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.805
or you can follow along with the same one as me,

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.345
which is going to be called merriweather,

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:36.895
so let's do a search for merriweather and this is one we want just here.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:40.510
From the drop down here we can select which version we want.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.455
I'm going to be using a light version,

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.300
which is light 300,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.030
so select this, and then to add this,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.855
we can click on the plus symbol just here.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:53.960
This then add it at the down at the bottom and then we can expand this to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.480
get some of the information we need to include it into our projects.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.950
That's all we can include in this style sheets in

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.010
our project by copying the link just here,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.995
and then go over to our index page.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:10.200
Close these down, so the index.html,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.210
and then we include this just above our custom CSS, so custom fonts.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.370
Then it just after this, we can paste this in.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.625
We can now go back over to the Google Fonts websites,

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:30.590
and you can see how to set this as a CSS rule in our custom style sheets.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.500
Down at the bottom, we can copy this line here,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.780
which is for the font family,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.790
and then over in our custom CSS, that's at this end.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.475
Let's first grab the body selector and then paste in the font family,

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:50.000
which is going to search for a merriweather if it can be found,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.935
if not, it will default back to a standard serif.

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.605
Give this a save, and then back over to the browser,

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:00.480
reload our index page,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.850
then factors needs to save.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.095
The index.html gives that a save, and then reload.

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:11.245
Now see the custom fonts has taken effect in the browser,

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:15.995
and this is all we need to do to include custom Google fonts in our project.

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:19.980
Next we'll move on to creating a header section.
