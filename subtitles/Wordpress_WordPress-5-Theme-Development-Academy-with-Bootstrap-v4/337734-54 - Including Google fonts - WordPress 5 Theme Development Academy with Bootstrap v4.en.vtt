00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.980
When it comes to adding custom fonts to our WordPress themes,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.680
we do have various ways we can approach this.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.435
We could add code in links to the font provider in the header section.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:17.175
Another option is to add these in the functions using WP enqueue style,

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.160
just like we did earlier with different style sheets.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.050
These all work perfectly fine,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.350
but this is a permanent solution which will require

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.610
the end user to have technical knowledge to change the font.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.910
Another option is to use a plugin which will allow

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.710
the end user to control the font from the dashboard.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.525
This is what we are going to be adding in now.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.075
If I go to a dashboard section,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.450
then going on to Plugins and Add New.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.370
I'm going to use a plugin called Easy Google Fonts.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.090
Let's give this a search.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.495
This is the one we need,

00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:03.675
we can install now, and then activate.

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:06.740
Using Easy Google Fonts will allow us to go into

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.770
the customizer and then select a Google Font,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.470
which we can also see in the live preview.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.465
We know how to go to the customizer.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:17.735
This is in appearance, and then customize.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:21.605
This will now give us a typography option which we can select,

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:24.040
and then click on default.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.275
This plugin will give us finer control over how our text is displayed,

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.120
even allowing it different fonts and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.240
font-weights to be used for paragraphs or different headings.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.415
I'm going to click on the first which is paragraphs,

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.790
and select the font family.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.979
Currently, this is set at the theme defaults.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.445
We can select any different web font we want from here.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.145
Let's select the Fanwood text.

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:52.075
Now, we can see the instant change in the browser.

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:55.950
I want to do a search for the Merriweather Font we currently have.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.210
Select this. This font will also be used for all of the rest of the text on the site too.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.670
But we can't go into each one of these and select

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.015
them if you would like to use a different font.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:11.100
For example, let's go for H three.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.610
Let's change this. Let's go for Georgia.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.795
As we can see our level three headings are changing and the rest is all staying the same.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.144
We want to also change this to be Merriweather,

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:26.610
just so it falls in line with the rest of the site.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.955
We also have tabs for margin, padding, border,

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:35.335
border radius and also the display type too,

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.954
which will allow the end user to have more control over spacing,

00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:43.000
colors, and sizing giving them a lot of flexibility.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.960
I'm just going to hit "Publish" and not change anything else since

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.480
we already have created the look we want in the bootstrap templates.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.690
All these options are useful for the end user,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.540
and this would all of our videos in this section have really allowed

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.815
the end user to add their own customizations to this theme.

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:05.210
Next up we're going to move on to the next section where we

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.390
can take a look at how we can prepare our code for translation.
