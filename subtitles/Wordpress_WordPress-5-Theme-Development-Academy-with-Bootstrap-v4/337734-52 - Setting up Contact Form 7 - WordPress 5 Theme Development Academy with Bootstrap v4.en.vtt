00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.100
Early in the course, we created a Contact Us page and added this HTML form at the bottom.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.890
Currently, this form does not do anything

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.055
since we've not set it up yet to work with WordPress.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.380
To make this work, I want to take advantage of

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.625
a really popular WordPress plugin called Contact Form 7.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:27.130
If we go over to the Dashboard and then go down to Plugins and Add New,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.870
this will most likely be in the Popular section,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.175
if not, we can do a search for Contact Form 7 over here.

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:36.975
This is the one we need here.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.250
Click on Install Now,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.050
then click on Activate.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.425
Just like when we added the advanced customer fields,

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:49.210
this will also give us a option in the Dashboard.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.850
We can click on Contact and this gives us a sample contact form which we can edit.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.745
Hover over the name and click on Edit,

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.745
and then we are taken to the form settings.

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:05.830
This sample form is not too far away from what we need by default.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.360
If we explore the syntax,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.980
we have a label at the top.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.920
We also have if the input is required inside of

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.740
the brackets and then below this we have a input inside of the square brackets.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.990
If we want to add additional fields,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.350
we can easily modify this form down at the bottom.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.450
Let's say if we wanted a number field,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.075
let's add the same by simply clicking on the number box just here.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:36.575
This one gives us the options such as if the field is required, the field name,

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.260
any classes and IDs you want to add,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.865
basically the usual attributes to have in a regular HTML input.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.575
We don't need this in our project,

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:49.660
so I'm just going to click on the X rather than inserting this.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.865
Our form inside of our Contact Us page has your name, e-mail and message.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:00.095
We already have your name and your e-mail and also the message at the bottom,

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:02.515
so we can remove the subjects,

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:05.340
and then we can save this form.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.280
With this now setup,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.100
we need to add it to our theme exactly where we want it to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.230
display in the page contactus.php file.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.705
Open the sidebar and let's head over to this file,

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:22.855
page-contact-us, which was our custom form.

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:26.840
The first step is to comment out our original form.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.770
Let's look for the form elements and select everything up to the opening form tag.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.390
I'm going to comment this out and then in place we can add in a custom shellcode.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.430
I'm going to do this by opening up the PHP tags.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.185
Those ease off. Within an echo,

00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:49.570
a function called do_short code.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.595
Inside the brackets, we need to paste in

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:56.300
a short code which is provided by Contact Form 7.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.685
We can grab this all from the Dashboard.

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:00.820
Inside of our contact form,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:09.675
we can copy this and then paste this in between the quotations and now we are good to go.

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:16.630
Now we've placed in this Contact Form 7 version in the place of our original HTML form.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.435
Save this and if you head over to our Contact Us page,

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.420
inside the browser, give that a reload.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.980
I will now see our form is on the page.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890
Our form is now displaying,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.905
however, it is missing our bootstrap styling.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:34.370
We will fix this in the next video,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.690
where we discover how to add our custom markup and styling it to this form.
