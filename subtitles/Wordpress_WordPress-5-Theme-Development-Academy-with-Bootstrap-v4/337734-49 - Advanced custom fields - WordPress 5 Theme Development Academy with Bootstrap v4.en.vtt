00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.295
As a theme developer,

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:03.930
when creating our theme,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.820
just like we have done, we have full control over everything we see in front of us.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.290
Since we created it,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.239
we can control the text,

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.625
any images, the layout,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.845
and all of the content.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:18.810
This is great news for us,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.380
but what about if you're creating a theme for somebody else to use,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.050
especially somebody not technical?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.315
As a theme's end-user,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.585
you would want to be able to change any of the text on the screen,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:32.970
the images, the titles,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.195
and so on, to suit the business or project you're working on.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:40.715
You would also want to do this from the WordPress Dashboard,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.570
rather than having to change any code.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.085
This is where Advanced Custom Fields comes into play,

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:51.100
and you can find this at advancedcustomfields.com.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.295
Check out this website if you want to find out more information,

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:58.220
but we'll find out exactly what this is and how to use

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.780
it as we implement this in to our theme.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.660
It's basically a WordPress Plugin,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.475
which will give our users the full control over the content from the WordPress Dashboard,

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:14.080
without needing to touch any of the themes code.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.345
This plugin links a path of our theme,

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:20.210
such as a block of text with a new field in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.355
the dashboard so the user can alter this as they need to.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.820
We are not just restricted to text fields either.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.705
We have a large choice of fields,

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.790
such as Images, Tabs, on Datepickers.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.745
Let's go ahead and install this so we can see it in action.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:39.995
If we go over to the Dashboard,

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:44.045
we could find this in the plugins and then add new link.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:48.240
I'm going to use search for Advanced Custom Fields,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.500
and this is the link we need here by Elliot Condon.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.090
I want to click install now.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.690
Also as with any of a WordPress plugin,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.510
do check that this plugin is compatible with your version before installing.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.715
We can then activate this plugin and then we get a new custom fields option on the left,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:15.680
which I'm going to click on.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.445
The first thing to do is to set a name for the field group by adding new.

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:26.015
This is a way to group together the fields in our project.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:30.035
The first thing we are prompted is to create a new field group.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:33.655
This, as it sounds, is a group of related fields.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:37.030
How you organize these fields is completely up to you.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.370
You can have a group for each page on your theme,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.140
or a group for a particular feature or section.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.745
This group is not just for organization, no,

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:49.820
we can also set certain rules for

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.010
this group for when it should be available on the edit screen.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.510
I'm now going to create a group called the front page,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.950
and then we can add fields to our front page,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.595
which we want to control.

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:06.360
We'll add this in a minute,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.775
but for now I'm going to go down to the location rules and only show this edit screen,

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:15.835
if the page type is equal to the front page.

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:20.150
This means all of the edit boxes which we're going to create will only be

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.510
visible when editing the front page and not when editing the blog, for example.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.885
If things don't fully make sense yet,

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:31.370
they will become more clear as we add some of the fields.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.220
If we go to our front page of our site,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.360
from the top, the user can already change

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.035
the site title and also the menu from the dashboard.

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.750
This background image will also come back in

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.105
a later video when we deal with enabling custom headers.

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:53.195
Let's begin by allowing the user to change the header text,

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:57.430
which is this text just here by adding a field.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.970
I'm going to call this the header text.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.795
We then need a field name which we'll add into our code.

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:09.875
We may have multiple header text areas on different pages.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.925
I'm going to be changing this to front page.

00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:16.084
The field type, this is multi-line,

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:18.590
so this needs to be text area.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.750
We can add some instructions to

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.625
the theme's user to let them know where these texts will be appearing on the theme,

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.935
so I'm going to add a message,

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:38.715
so the text positioned over the header image on the front page.

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:41.250
This is required.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.140
The default value,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.655
I'm going to set this to be the same as the text.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:50.145
We already have, paste this in.

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:52.095
If the user doesn't change this field,

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:54.430
this is what we will see.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.040
Next up, I'm going to add some formatting,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.485
so that we can automatically add a break tag after each line,

00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:05.890
and then publish this field.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.305
The next thing to do is to add in our theme exactly where we want this text to appear.

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:14.705
Now let's add this into our theme.

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:21.045
The feature texts is output in the functions.php inside the front page section.

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:24.420
Rather than echoing out this text which we do here,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.245
we can use the advanced custom fields function which is provided, called the fields.

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:36.515
Then as a string, we can pass in the name of the field which we just created.

00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:40.145
We just created the header text from page,

00:05:40.145 --> 00:05:43.030
so we can add this into place.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.010
This now means that any text which is added in

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.900
the edit screen will display in this location.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.020
Save this file, make sure this is published.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.100
If we go to our site and then edit the homepage,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.410
we now have a new option down at the bottom.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.510
We now have our front page group,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.760
which only consists of the header text,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.535
and then we have a text box which we can edit.

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:13.045
Let's just make a small change.

00:06:13.045 --> 00:06:17.400
Click on updates, then view the page.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.070
This is changed on the homepage.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.055
Then just click on the blog and check this is okay.

00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:25.545
We see this doesn't affect the blog page.

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:29.760
Let's go back to the edit screen and reinstate this.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.755
We can do the same with some more fields,

00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:36.690
which we want to make editable.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.999
Down in the welcome section,

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:40.865
if we visit our site,

00:06:40.865 --> 00:06:44.600
we have the section title of "Welcome to Tranquil Spa."

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.705
We have images and our three sections.

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:50.425
Let's begin with this site title.

00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:53.355
To do this, we can add a new field.

00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:58.470
The field label, let's call this the welcome section title.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.410
We can leave this field name as it is. This is text.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.660
The instructions is going to be,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.405
the title for the welcome section on the front page.

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:15.585
This is also a required field.

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.555
We can add our placeholder text,

00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:21.490
we can keep this the same as it is,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.945
so the default value,

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:31.750
you place all the texts which will appear on the edit screen in the form input.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.805
That's all we need to do, we update this.

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:38.070
We can then add this field name of,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.230
welcome section title into the field function of our front page,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.540
so go over to our front-page.php.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.910
Rather than our level three heading of,

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.905
"Welcome to tranquil spa" we need to generate the php function,

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:57.215
which is the underscore field,

00:07:57.215 --> 00:08:00.930
passing in as a string, our field name.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.225
Next, the image which sits just below the title,

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:08.825
which is our divider image, this one here.

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.210
Back to advanced custom fields,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.360
let's add our third field.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.715
I'm going to call it the, section title image.

00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:20.235
The field name is fine.

00:08:20.235 --> 00:08:23.910
We also have a field type of image.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.450
Instructions, this is simply,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:37.000
the image which separates the section title from the content.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.645
This is also required field.

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:44.840
The format is going to be an image URL.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.230
We can also set the preview size if we want.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.995
I'm going to set this to be a thumbnail size of 150.

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:55.970
You can also fine tune the maximum and minimum sizes,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.710
but this is fine for now so I'm going to click on update,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.700
then back to our front page template.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.145
This is added just below the title,

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.390
so in the image source,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.030
let's delete the path to our current image.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.530
Then we can replace this with some php.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:26.010
This time the field is going to contain a string value of section titled image.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.885
Next up we can move on to our first section,

00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:34.940
which is the hair and makeup,

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.100
beginning with the image,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.305
let's add a new field.

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:45.140
Let's call this the, welcome section 1 and then the image.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.225
The field name is fine.

00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:50.840
Just like before the content type means the image.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:10:01.210
Instructions, this is the image to display in section 1 of the welcome section.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.930
This is a required field.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.390
Again, we're going to have an image URL.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:13.910
Preview size I'm going to set of 150. Let's update.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.330
I know what to do now if we go back to our front page,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.620
let's go to our first section.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.735
Our first image inside the col-sm-3 section,

00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:28.215
let's remove our image source that we already have.

00:10:28.215 --> 00:10:33.405
Then I'm going to copy the field from just above,

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:35.610
add this into the source,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.470
and the image is called the,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.450
welcome section 1 image.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.595
Make sure this matches up with the field which we set,

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:50.810
then the same with the hair and makeup text.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.530
The field label, I want to keep this consistent,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.800
welcome section 1 text."

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.230
This is a text field with the instructions of,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:11.860
the text to display in section 1 of the welcome section.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.085
Again, this is a required field,

00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:19.730
and we can update this and add this image to our front page,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:25.235
just below our image that we added in before we can replace our text of hair & makeup,

00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:27.960
with the file name of,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.880
welcome section 1 text.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.255
Save this and now before we go any further,

00:11:35.255 --> 00:11:37.160
let's check this is working okay,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.940
if we go to the edit page.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.159
We see we've lost our text and images.

00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:45.875
We can add these back in in the dashboard.

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:48.515
Now how some more fields to edit.

00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:51.260
We have the welcome section title.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.190
We can upload our divider image,

00:11:54.190 --> 00:12:00.705
so let's go over to our files inside the local sites.

00:12:00.705 --> 00:12:05.460
I'm going to add both of our divider images into the media library.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.080
Select the purple one,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.935
the section 1 image,

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:13.200
which is the brushes,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.585
again we need to drag this over.

00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:18.540
This is a makeup.jpg,

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.795
drag it into the media library and select and then the text,

00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:27.930
which is going to be, hair & make up.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.565
You can also add this as a default 2.

00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:36.160
Update our page and let's visit this.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.085
Now everything is reinstated back to how it was.

00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:44.485
But this time the end user has full control over how it looks.

00:12:44.485 --> 00:12:47.545
I'm going to leave this front page as it is for now,

00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:50.240
since the rest is just a case of repetition,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.495
and it would make for some really long, boring videos.

00:12:53.495 --> 00:12:56.570
But the main thing is you understand now how this works.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:02.090
Feel free to continue with the rest of the page or any other pages on the site.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:09.240
Next, we'll continue by making our theme more customizable by enabling custom headers.
