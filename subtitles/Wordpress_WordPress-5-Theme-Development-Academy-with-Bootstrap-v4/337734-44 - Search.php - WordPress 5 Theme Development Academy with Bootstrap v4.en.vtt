00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.780
Currently if we create a search,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.925
just like we've done in the previous video,

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:09.105
if no search.php file is found,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.945
WordPress will default back to this index.php.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.430
Since our search results will display in a similar way to this index page,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.295
we can use this as a good starting point to create our search file to show this contents.

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:27.300
Let's go over to our projects and create a new file in the root of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.755
the project, call this search.php.

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:36.930
Then we can grab the contents of the index page by selecting all,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.285
copy this, and then paste this in our search.php.

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:47.710
We can start from the top by changing the comment to be the template for displaying

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:56.580
search results pages and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.350
then test this is working.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.265
If we make a small change,

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:03.055
such as if you go to the title,

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:06.680
let's just add hello up at the top here,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.645
and if we go to our regular blog,

00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:13.240
we don't see the text of hello but,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.315
let's do a search and now we see the text of hello appearing after each search results.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:24.095
So now our template is working and taking effect.

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.820
We can begin to customize this file.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.780
We're going to give the user some feedback to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.510
what search term they have entered in the form.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.280
To do this, I'm going to add to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.710
our custom feature text function to add this into the header.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.540
So let's go over to the functions.php file.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.765
Then if we look for our feature text section,

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:47.910
which is just here,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.840
just after this else-if section,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.275
locate the curly brace.

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.920
Make a little space, we can add a new else-if

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.800
block and the condition we want to check if the page is the search.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.645
If it is, we'll add the curly braces and then run the code inside here.

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:13.730
First of all, I'm going to add the official blog section since this is still

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.615
displaying blog posts and then on a new line we're going to output a break tag.

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:23.285
This is just regular HTML break tags.

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.790
Then after this text on the line break,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.220
we can also display the search term that has been entered by the user.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.945
We can do this by using a print f function.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:38.460
We used print f earlier to display text with any formatting,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.120
in our case to enter the search term using a placeholder.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.335
So add the print f function.

00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:51.765
Then we can output our text with the double underscores as a string.

00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:55.260
We can add the texts of search results for,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.815
followed by a colon and then we can add

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:04.730
our variable inside with the percent symbol than the s. After this,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.525
we add a comma and add a second value to our print f function.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:12.680
This is going to be the input which is being entered into the search.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.085
We can grab this value with a WordPress function called,

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:22.320
'Get search query,' then add a semicolon at the end and I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.060
think we also need one just after

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.925
our break tag and let's see this in action inside of our search.

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:35.340
Let's do a search for lorem and now we see the text of, "search results for,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.570
" and then we've pulled in the value of lorem as

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.460
our second value and placed it into this variable here,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.585
which we grabbed from the search query.

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:51.830
To finish things off, if we enter a search and nothing is found,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.605
to search for anything inside here,

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:56.345
we see the text of, "Sorry,

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:58.310
no post matched your criteria."

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.500
This message is more specific to our blog rather than our search page.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.025
Let's go through our search templates,

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:10.020
I'm making changes just after our end while section.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.015
So delete this text here.

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:17.565
So we'll say, "Sorry, no matches for."

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:21.680
After this string of text we can also add onto the end with the dot,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.380
the value which the user searched for with

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.170
the WordPress function called, 'Get search query.'

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.100
After this, we can also add a string onto the end saying, "Please search again."

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.410
So a comma, and then please search again.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.110
The next step is to emphasize our search query.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.000
So we can do this with the HTML emphasis tags which is em.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.385
So this is in the opening string.

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:51.530
In the string just afterwards we can close this

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.440
off and see how this is looking over in the browser.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.595
So now we'll search for an unrecognized string.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:02.550
We get the text of, "Sorry, no matches for."

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.220
We then pull in our search query using

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.195
this WordPress function and then afterwards, please search again.

00:05:09.195 --> 00:05:13.100
This is how we can add a custom search form and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.095
also how we can add a custom search template to display the results.

00:05:17.095 --> 00:05:23.940
So I'll see you now in the next video where we'll add a 404 page and widgets.
