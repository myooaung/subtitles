00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.970
The final part of this homepage is to create the foot area.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.770
If you go down to the finished version,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.005
this is the area right at the bottom here,

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.275
which is going to be split into three sections.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.445
We'll have a formal left-hand side to sign up via e-mail,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:21.240
we'll have the Setting center about the location,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.525
and we'll also have some navigation links over on rights.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.240
You may also noticed that we have some icons

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
too down to the bottom for social media links.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.915
These are all going to be provided with a library called Font Awesome.

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:38.300
Let's begin by installing this into our projects.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
I head over to fontawesome.com.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.250
This has a free version.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.830
So let's click on this button just here.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.065
This is a free underpaid pro-version.

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:51.875
We just need this free version for our needs,

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:55.615
which we can download from this button just here.

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:57.825
It is different ways to use it.

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:01.620
We can just click on the "Download" and start that off.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.120
There's different ways to install for libraries such as View,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.985
React, and you can also download it using tools such as sketch.

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:15.005
Next up make sure that we are on the web section here and click on the "Download",

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.375
which will kick off the installer.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:22.895
Websites like this do often have a habit of changing designs and layouts.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:25.355
So if it looks a little different from this,

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.850
just take a look for the download.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.915
There is also a CDN link available too,

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:35.540
but I want to download these and add these directly into our project.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.650
You can also feel free to check out the icons with this link here,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.405
and you can see all the available icons which will just downloaded.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:47.090
We'll use some of these throughout the project.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.555
Let's begin by opening up the folder.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.935
The name of the folder includes the version number and I'm just going to

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:59.200
shorten this down to Font Awesome so it's easy to work with.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.995
Then move this over to our projects.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:07.535
If we open up, the trunk will be as folder into the CSS.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:13.045
You can then drag over the full font-awesome folder and place it into there.

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:17.240
Now, if you open up the sidebar and then into the CSS,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.645
just make sure this folder has been included.

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:24.030
Inside of the Font Awesome folder,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.025
I'm going to link to the minified version of all fonts.

00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:29.975
This is in CSS,

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:33.885
and then this is all.min.css.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:37.550
We can add the file path in the index page.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.720
If we go up to our CSS links in the header,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.380
I'm going to add the link just above our custom CSS.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.535
Let's add a comment of Font Awesome, the link.

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:57.635
This one again is in our CSS folder.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:07.230
It's in the Font Awesome folder after this, then css/all.min.css.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.950
This is all we need to do now to link Font Awesome to our project.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.960
We'll test this is all working soon,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.390
when we get to adding them in the footer.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.295
For now though, let's get to work with adding the footer, which you can see here.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:26.970
We can add a container down at the bottom to hold this.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.650
So down at the bottom it just above our JavaScript.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.830
Let's add a comment or footer section.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.070
I'm going to use the HTML footer element for this.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:53.080
You can still add the same classes of container fluid and also py-5.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.360
Inside here this takes in a div with the class of row,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.860
so we can then nest inside our columns.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.745
The first one is going to be for the social media section of stay connected on the side,

00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:09.709
which is going to be a title,

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.840
a sign-up form, and then we'll add our social media icons later on.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.880
Since there's three different sections,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.670
we can split this up into four columns each with a class of col-sm-4.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.760
The text in a level 5 heading of stay connected.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.005
After this, let's place in our form,

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:42.260
we don't need an action since you're just creating HTML structure for now.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.095
Inside here we're going to add a div which is going to

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:48.625
surround or grouped together our form elements.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:51.605
It's going to take in some Bootstrap classes.

00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:56.315
The first one is going to be form row to make an inline form,

00:04:56.315 --> 00:05:01.180
then the second one of form group to group together our inputs.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.310
This form is only going to contain the email address inputs and then the button.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.220
The input on the left is going to be eight columns wide,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.195
and then we can use the remaining four for the sign up button.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:16.370
Let's create our sections for these.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.160
The first one is for the input.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.850
So this will be called sm-8.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.940
Then the one for our button and just below,

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.850
for the remaining four sections.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.160
Let's start with the form input.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.365
This is going to be an input with the type of email,

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:47.945
the bootstrap classes of form control,

00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:52.530
and some placeholder text of email address,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.820
then down to the bottom section.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.275
So the button is going to have the text of sign-up.

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:04.940
It also needs a type.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.665
The type of submits inside here and then the Bootstrap class.

00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:13.124
The first one of btn,

00:06:13.124 --> 00:06:17.430
btn-primary, to give it the blue color.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.170
We'll also be adding a little Font Awesome icon to the right hand side of the text.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.030
We'll come back to this in just a bit.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.345
Let us save and let's see how this is looking, reload,

00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:35.365
and there is our form at the bottom and we'll add the social media icons very soon,

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:36.970
which you see here.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.150
For now just after the form we'll add a comment.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.490
So social media icons,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.900
and we'll come back to these very soon.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.575
After this closing div, we have two more sections which four columns each.

00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:57.295
The next one is going to be for the text and then the navigation on the right.

00:06:57.295 --> 00:07:01.840
So div with the class of col-sm-4.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:12.795
This one will have a level 5 heading and this time the text is our setting, and a comma.

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:17.750
Afterwards, all we're going to do is add the p element with some sample text.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.525
Again, if you using Visual Studio Code,

00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:23.850
you can type in Lorem and then hit "Tab".

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.515
This is all we need to do for our middle section.

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:29.810
So now after our col-sm-4,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.100
we can add one more,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:37.440
which is for our list items on the right class col-sm-4.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.495
This one will also have a level 5 heading of navigation,

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:47.580
followed by a unordered list,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.650
which will contain our navigation links.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:02.045
The bootstrap class for the unordered list is a list group and list items,

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:06.000
which takes in the class of list-group-item.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.610
These are going to be links, so let's add the a element inside here,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.625
the href, the link.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:19.915
This one is going to be for the blog to HTML.

00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:22.405
We haven't created this page just yet,

00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:27.955
but we'll ask the text of blog, copy and paste.

00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:31.435
This one is for the contact page.

00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:36.100
This will be contact for HTML,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:45.020
then the text of contactors and UML link for the privacy policy.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.760
Actually we have href gives us go to browser.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.130
That's all the contents which we now need.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.240
We're going to now apply a little bit CSS just to finish off this page.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.940
Starting with these blue links just here,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.965
let's go over to our style.CSS, or Custom.CSS,

00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:14.980
and outside of the media query,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.615
let's target the footer,

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:19.785
beginning with the links,

00:09:19.785 --> 00:09:21.585
so these are the a elements.

00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:27.790
We can reset the color to be a value of 212529.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.650
See how this is looking much better.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.195
Now if we go back over infarct we can shrink the browser now first,

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:40.780
we see things need a little bit more spacing,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:47.320
things such as if we scroll down the golden title which is here,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.910
is a little bit spacing on the top and bottom, down to the footer.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.125
Also these inputs and button needs some spacing too.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:59.830
To fix this over in the Custom.CSS,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:07.060
I'm going to create a new media query targeting a maximum width of 768 pixels.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.825
The styles will only work on the small screens.

00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:17.845
After this media query, you can add more new one at media wants target these screens,

00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:24.560
and also the maximum width of 768 pixels.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.685
Add the calli braces.

00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:32.275
Let's start by adding the margin top or the title,

00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:36.110
this is the golden title that we've seen before.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.330
One em is fine for this.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:46.400
We can add some spacing onto our Button by typing footer button.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.825
This will only take effect on any buttons inside the footer.

00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:57.205
Margins are also to be a value of 1em,

00:10:57.205 --> 00:11:01.090
save and then reload. We'll have some more space.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.905
Around that, we have our spacing above the titles too.

00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:09.370
Finally finish off, I want to add some padding and

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.955
also a border bottom to each one of these sections.

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:16.480
The sections also from the footer,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:25.750
can grab each div with the class of col-sm - 4 for a border bottom to start aligned,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.765
to separate each one of one pixel.

00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:34.130
A solid line, and a color of ddd.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.730
Then some padding inside of 20 pixels on the top and bottom,

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.450
and then 10 pixels on the left and right.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.790
Open this up, refresh.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.215
Looks as though we've got an extra line inside here so let's take a look.

00:11:53.215 --> 00:11:58.210
Down to the footer, this is just next to the button,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.625
to have one just below there.

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:04.015
This is the actual 1.5 here,

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:07.310
and these is supposed to be for medium devices.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.420
Let's change this to be MD.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.675
These are on the own lines on these mobile devices.

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:16.075
We are going to break onto the road next to each of that on

00:12:16.075 --> 00:12:20.420
medium devices and above, save and refresh.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:28.930
This now looks much better on the smaller and also for the larger screens.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:34.195
All that's left to do now for this footer is to add the social media icons.

00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:36.145
Back over to the footer.

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:37.929
We created a comment,

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:41.095
and we'll also add these to the Sign Up button.

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:45.235
The free version allows us to access two different styles of icon,

00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:47.965
which is called brands and solid.

00:12:47.965 --> 00:12:52.105
Solid icons as they sound or a solid black icon,

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:56.515
and is uses for things such as a company or credit card icon.

00:12:56.515 --> 00:13:00.310
We use the CSS class FAB for brands,

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.010
and FAAS for solid.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.905
The irregular and light versions too,

00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:08.920
but these are only available on the pro version.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.395
Let's begin in the Sign Up button.

00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:15.310
We can add a Font Awesome icon by using the I elements.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.970
I'm going to add these on two separate lines so it's more clear.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.245
Open up the I elements,

00:13:21.245 --> 00:13:23.370
and then it needs a class.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.495
Inside here, we first specify which type of button we want.

00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:30.540
If we want the solids or the brown version,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.740
I'm going to go for the solid version.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.310
So we'll type in FAS which is Formed Awesome Solids,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.130
and then we type in the name of the icon.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.829
We follow him around the Font Awesome website.

00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:45.370
You can get the name of each icon just underneath.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.610
We'll add these in by adding a class name of FFA.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.260
Then the name of angle double right.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.030
Give that a save and then reload the projects down in the footer area.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.665
We now have the double angle rights icon which we started in.

00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:10.300
I'm going to go back over to our projects icons just below this for

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.709
our social media section so just under social the media icons,

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:18.205
we're going to do exactly the same by adding the I elements.

00:14:18.205 --> 00:14:21.775
The class this time is going to start with FAB,

00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:23.950
so its the brand icons,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.660
the name of FA, which is going to be for our Facebook icon.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.635
So Facebook-square, and then a third class which is optional.

00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:38.395
This to make the fonts twice the size.

00:14:38.395 --> 00:14:42.790
We can do this with FA, and then 2X.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.885
I'm going to copy and paste this in three more times.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:51.350
The second one will replace Facebook with Twitter.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.575
The third one this is going to be for Instagram.

00:14:56.575 --> 00:14:59.810
The last one is Pinterest.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.085
All the rest will stay the same.

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:05.275
Check this out on the browser.

00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:08.560
We miss an Instagram,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.565
and this doesn't need squared on the end, sorry about that.

00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:15.565
Then over to Chrome, reload,

00:15:15.565 --> 00:15:18.205
and now we have our four icons.

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:20.920
That's it now for our homepage,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.450
for our Bootstrap templates.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.560
I hope you enjoyed this section and learned a lot about using a Bootstrap.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.480
Coming up in the next section,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.125
we will finish off this project by adding the additional pages,

00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:35.305
such as the blog and the Contact Us page.

00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:38.300
Thank you and I will see you there.
