1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,940
So were you successful?

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,880
Let's start with the favorite feature. We manage that in the product.dart file, here we have to toggle

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,090
favorite status method and in the end, it's here where I want to send a HTTP request to also save that

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,190
new status for the product we're updating and of course, we have the ID of the product available in

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:29,560
here to the server. So let's import the HTTP package here because we'll need that send HTTP requests

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:36,190
and whilst technically not required because it exposes so many features, I'll bundle them all again under

7
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,350
the HTTP prefix.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,420
Now we can send a request and as I mentioned, I want to employ optimistic updating here which means

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,080
that I first change this

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,380
and then I roll it back if it fails.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,970
Hence, I'll first of all store the old status, so old status is isFavorite and this copies the old status

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,270
here,

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,220
it makes sure that we keep that old status before we then change it.

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,860
So here, we then change the favoriting status and we update the UI,

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,920
that's that optimistic updating part,

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,760
we do that before to request is sent and then we do send a request

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,960
and now here, I want to send a patch request because the goal of course is to update our products or a specific

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,380
product

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,390
here of course with the new favorite status. I want to keep all the existing data there as it and just

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,910
exchange the favorite status.

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:34,140
So therefore here, I patch and the URL I want to target is the same URL I used here for updating

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,970
or for deleting a product because we need a URL that includes the ID.

23
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,850
The ID here is available because it is a property of this class and since this of course always

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,220
will execute for concrete instances of this class right,

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,540
the ID will be set and therefore, we'll target a specific ID and send our request to that ID. Now

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,430
the body is the data which I want to change or describes the change

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,710
and here, we want to json.encode and for that, I need to import dart:convert here,

28
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,920
that's important,

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,120
add that import. With that import added here, we can call json.encode and encode a map where I only

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,930
want to set the isFavorite key

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,180
and again that should match the name you have here on your server,

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,670
so that isFavorite name you have there as well

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,390
and the new value here is the new value we have here,

34
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,680
so isFavorite, after it was switched because of course I want to store that new value which we also

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,190
use locally on the server.

36
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:43,960
Now normally, that should succeed of course but it might fail. So we can use async await here and wrap

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,160
this into a try catch block to roll this back.

38
00:02:50,710 --> 00:03:01,470
So let's add catch error here and return a future in here and I have one curly brace,

39
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,930
too much, should have it here.

40
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,880
So now we have that block and in here, I would want to roll this back,

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,810
so here what I set isFavorite which refers to my isFavorite property up there and set this equal to

42
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:23,870
the old status which I saved, so I set this equal to old status here. If we do that and we reload this,

43
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,660
let's see whether it works,

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,890
so first of all without an error here. If I do that, here for example I already mark this as a favorite

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,420
on the server by setting it to true there,

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,210
if I switch this, it's updated here and also here, it's now false,

47
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,590
so this works

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,300
and if I do this multiple times, this also works, it's false here,

49
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,900
it's false here,

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,620
so that works.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,080
Now let's simulate an error, again with the good old trick of removing the JSON thing here,

52
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,020
let's do a hot refresh because we lose our local state when we do a hot reload here

53
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,740
and let's try this again, whether the updating works. If I set this,

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:12,940
it gets checked and it's not reverted. Now it doesn't end up on a server because we have an error

55
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,490
of course but we don't revert the value.

56
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,120
Now for one, I'm not calling NotifyListeners here,

57
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,820
I should do that here because otherwise the UI can't update,

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,630
you have to call that to update UI, just as we're doing it up here

59
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,320
but that's actually not the reason or the problem here,

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,830
instead the problem really is what we had before that the HTTP package only throws its own error for

61
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:43,120
get and post requests if the server returns an error status code. For patch, put, delete, it doesn't

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,310
do that.

63
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,840
Now we still might want to leave try catch here because for example if we have a network error, we still

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,650
might want to run that logic and we still might get a normal exception

65
00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:00,880
but I also want to manually extract my response here and store it in that final variable and then check

66
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:08,390
if response status code is greater or equal than 400, which means we have an error

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,760
and in that case, also do that roll back logic and since I have some code duplication here of course,

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,430
you could also add an extra method which doesn't return anything, with an underscore because it should be private

69
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:30,980
and only be callable from inside this file and class which I'll name set fav value

70
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:37,890
and there I expect to get the new value as a boolean and in there, I simply set isFavorite equal to

71
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,290
the new value and call NotifyListeners

72
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,000
and now we can simply call set fav value to old status here

73
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,370
and this saves us one extra line of code and avoids a bit of code duplication.

74
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,880
Now with that changed,

75
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,780
so now that we manually check the status code,

76
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,770
we should have a setup where we have successful optimistic updating.

77
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,530
So I try to change this and I reflect the new status in the UI but then this should get rolled back

78
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,550
and it does as soon as we have that error.

79
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,320
So now we have proper optimistic updating in place

80
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:18,120
and with that of course, let me fix that error to again check whether it still works, if we are able to

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
send that request.

82
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,670
So let's do a reload here,

83
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,950
mark this and now it stays marked and we also see that here on the back-end that it's true.

84
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,190
So this works,

85
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,650
now we are able to update our favorite status and also store that on a server.
