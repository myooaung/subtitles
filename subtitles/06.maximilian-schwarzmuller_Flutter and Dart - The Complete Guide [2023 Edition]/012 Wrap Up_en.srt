00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,900
So that's it for animations, of course there are more things you could animated in this app if you wanted

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,720
to.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,430
I am happy with this state here where we're animating a lot, where there are a lot of things changing

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,610
on the screen and I hope that you learned a lot about animations, how you could fully control them on your

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,900
own but why you might want to use built-in widgets because it's easier and it optimizes performance.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,380
There are a bunch of built-in widgets with a different level of detail, some give you more control, others

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,540
give you very little control, like animated container which basically finds out what it needs to change

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,320
totally on its own and with all of that and all these built-in widgets, you have powerful animation capabilities

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,090
that should allow you to build applications that look and feel good to your users.
