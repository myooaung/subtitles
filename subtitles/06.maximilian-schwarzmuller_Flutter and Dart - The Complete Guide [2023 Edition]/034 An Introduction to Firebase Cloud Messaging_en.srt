1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:08,720
Now you can Google for FCM, which stands for Firebase Cloud Messaging, to find your official Firebase

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,400
Cloud Messaging Docs.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,890
And there you can learn more about that and also learn more about the iOS and Android setup, though

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,480
you shouldn't go through those steps right now.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,530
We'll go through them together and in flutter case, we need to deviate from these steps here, at least

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,220
in some points.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,840
So don't go through them here.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,590
But if you ever work on a non flutter app that might be useful.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,650
It's also worth noting that you can also use the Firebase Cloud Messaging Service to send push notifications

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,290
to Web apps, but we're not going to focus on that here.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,540
Now, you can also learn more about the architecture behind that here, and that essentially is the

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,230
architecture I described.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,400
You have some way of creating a message, of creating a notification.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,430
You then let the Firebase Cloud Messaging Service know about this.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,940
And this then uses the different transport layers for Android and for iOS and so on to deliver it to

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,720
the devices.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,940
So that's essentially what I described here.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,210
But if you want to read more about that, this is your documentation.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,630
And then you also get this about FCM Messages article which deeply dives into notifications.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,120
You can send different kinds of notifications you can send and all you might want to know about push

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,230
notifications.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,860
In this course, I will rather focus on how to make it work instead of covering all possible kinds of

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,690
push notifications you could send.

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,600
If there is something you're interested in and if you need a specific use case for your next application.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,100
The official docs here therefore are the way to go to learn all about that.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,990
Essentially, there is one thing that is worth noting, and that is that you have two main kinds of

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,800
messages.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,730
You have notification messages and you have data messages.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,040
Notification messages are your default push notifications that pop up on the device.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,770
Even if the device is in lock mode or if the app is running in the background and you can then tap those

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,960
notifications to be taken to the app.

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,630
Data messages are a bit different from that.

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,170
They're meant to transport data, for example, to your already running app to update some data in there

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,090
from behind the scenes, for example.

35
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,000
So the traditional push notification and the push notification we're going to look into in this module

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,850
will be this notification message here.

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,410
So that is the overview.

38
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,130
That is Firebase Cloud messaging and what you need to know about it.

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,660
Of course, you should also check out the pricing page for cloud messaging to avoid any unwanted costs.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,730
But as you can see, currently, cloud messaging here is free and we therefore shouldn't face any issues

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,600
at the moment.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,060
Still, there is a document that is worth checking out if you plan on using that in your real app.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,370
Now with that.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,690
You can, of course, search for flutter cloud messaging to find the official Firebase messaging flutter

45
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,550
package.

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,760
So just like the other flutter packages which be added like Firebase off Firebase Storage and Cloud

47
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,650
Store, this is a package which you can add to your Flutter project to prepare it for push notifications

48
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,960
and to handle push notifications.

49
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,670
So therefore we should definitely go through the setup and installation steps here.

50
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,090
Now the first step is that we click on installing and we just wrap this dependency and then go to the

51
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,880
pops back to the YAML file and add it here like we added all the other Firebase packages, but that's

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,140
not all we need to do.

53
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,840
Instead, now we got specific setup steps for Android and further down below all the for iOS.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,060
And yes, we got a couple of steps there.

55
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,520
There are a couple of steps we need to go through because push notifications setup is a bit more complex

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,360
because of the reasons I outlined on this slide a few minutes ago.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,520
So let's start with Android here.

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,160
I will also show the entire iOS push notification process, though.

59
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:07,220
One important note you can test push notifications on the Android emulator for iOS.

60
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,970
You need a real iOS device, though you can't test push notifications on iOS simulators.

61
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,100
That is simply a restriction imposed by Apple and there is nothing I can do about that.

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,020
So with that, let's get started with the Android integration in the next lecture.
