00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.670
Before we fixed a landscape mode let's all to test our app on a very small screen.

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.190
And for that here I created a super small emulator on a free dot seven inch device which is not too

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.160
big and I'll then launch the app on that emulator.

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.010
So here's key app on a smaller device a very small device.

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.780
As you can see on portrait mode this looks OK.

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.840
Doesn't look too shabby.

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.910
We can certainly work with that but of course here on landscape mode we all do we'll have a problem.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:40.450
If I turn on the lights rotation your as you can tell especially on such a super small device the charge

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.000
is basically not there.

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.390
The image is too big.

11
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.490
Therefore we have that overflow cost by the image which we don't resize dynamically and yet the chart

12
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.960
simply doesn't fit there.

13
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:59.800
On smaller screens so we might want a different solution for landscape and well then also landscape

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.590
on smaller screens but it's a general landscape problem.

15
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.580
Our app is clearly aimed at portrait mode right now and it doesn't work on landscape mode never on small

16
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.800
devices nor on big devices.

17
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.540
So let's fix that and let's see how we can fix it.

18
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.520
One possible fix and dad can be valid based on the app your building is that you simply don't allow

19
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.420
landscape mode.

20
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.570
You can do this in your main dart file in the main function which is the first function that runs when

21
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.100
your app starts.

22
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Instead of using that shortcut where you only have one expression in there

23
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.080
let's use that longer form here like this.

24
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.000
And besides just running run app here which of course is an important function to run your app you can

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.580
now also use a certain object system chrome for that you need to import package flatter services that

26
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.300
dart you need to add this import here in your main dart file and system chrome allows you to set some

27
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:16.730
application light or system wide settings for your app and there for example you can call set preferred

28
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.710
orientations and pass a list of orientations you want to use or you want to allow for your app and this

29
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.000
should be a list and there you can use device orientation dot.

30
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.600
And now for example only allow portrait app and maybe portrait down so that you don't care about how

31
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.970
the user is holding his phone.

32
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.600
But it should be in portrait mode if you do that and you save this and you then restart your app.

33
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.250
You will see that now we're forced into portrait mode and we can't rotate this app and this might be

34
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.480
a liable solution for many applications that really don't make sense on landscape mode but it can also

35
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.540
be a solution where you simply are too lazy to implement a proper landscape mode.

36
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.860
So here I'll actually commented out because of course besides that quick win year which can be viable

37
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:18.080
I want to show you how you can actually adjust your app to landscape mode in a way that it really works

38
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.490
there and looks good there.
