00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:04,100
- [Instructor] Now, with
the course introduction

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,033
and all the basics out of the way,

3
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:09,633
and with Flutter and
Android Studio and so on

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,300
installed on our system,

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,500
it's now finally time to
dive into Flutter development

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,100
and to learn Flutter and Dart.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,400
And for that, we're going to
create a new project here.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,800
So for that, again, use the cd command

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,566
to navigate into some
folder on your system

10
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:30,466
where you want to create that project.

11
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,866
And then once you navigated there

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,200
in your terminal or command prompt,

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,666
you run "flutter create"
to create a new project

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,500
and give it any name you want.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,466
And I'll name it "flutter_complete_guide."

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,333
The project name is up to you,

17
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:52,333
but it should not contain
any dots or dashes

18
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,900
or white spaces.

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,866
Instead, if you have multiple words,

20
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,300
separate them with underscores.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,766
And the convention also is
to use an all lowercase name

22
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,133
like I'm using it here.

23
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,100
And then simply hit
enter, and as you learn,

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,266
this will now create a new folder

25
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:12,166
in that path where you
navigated to before,

26
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,133
and stored these initial
Flutter project files

27
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,900
in that folder.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,266
And then we can again
use Visual Studio Code

29
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:23,166
or Android Studio to open that folder.

30
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,833
And that's what I did here.

31
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,166
So then, be get our Flutter project here.

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,300
Now, this Flutter
project, which I got here

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,800
has a web folder,

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,766
and I'll delete that folder
since we're not going to build

35
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:35,800
for the web here.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,633
So I'll just move that to trash.

37
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,933
But I'll keep all the
other folders and files

38
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,200
which I have in there.

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Now, I'll walk you through
these folders and files

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,300
and what they do in the next lecture.

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,200
For the moment, I just want to make sure

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
that we have to same
kind of starting project.

43
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:57,666
And to ensure this, attached
you find my "pubspec.yaml" file

44
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,100
and a "main.dart" file.

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,966
And you should replace your
"main.dart" file with mine

46
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:07,800
and delete any other files
or folders you might have

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,300
in your lib folder with mine,

48
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,333
and replace your
"pubspec.yaml" file with mine.

49
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,033
This is really important.

50
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,533
Now one important

51
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,866
note regarding my pubspec.yaml file:

52
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:25,333
I named my project flutter_complete_guide,

53
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:30,066
and if you chose a different
name for your project, you might get an error.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,766
What you
should do in that case is take your project name.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,733
So the name of your project folder,
which in my case is "flutter_complete_guide".

56
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:44,366
But if you had a different name
here, if you chose a different name when creating

57
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:48,600
the project with
"flutter create", you should plug that name here

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,966
into the "pubspec.yaml" file instead of

59
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:55,033
"flutter_complete_guide".

60
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:59,133
In addition, you might get an error in this widget_test.dart file.

61
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,366
widget_test.dart file here.

62
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:06,200
After adding my main.dart file to the project.

63
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,733
Now you can ignore this.

64
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,966
Ever since this test file is there for

65
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:14,633
automated tests,
and that's not something we'll do in this course.

66
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:18,666
But to get
rid of that problem, you can simply delete the test

67
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,533
folder or that test file because we won't need it.

68
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,400
We will instead
work in the lib folder because that's where

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,466
we put the code we write for our application.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,233
You then also might want
to open this terminal,

71
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:39,666
and in that terminal, run
"flutter packages get."

72
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,633
Typically this should not
be required because Flutter

73
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,333
should run it behind the
scenes automatically,

74
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,366
but this is important to
ensure that Flutter picks up

75
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,666
that "pubspec.yaml" file,
which I provided to you.

76
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,033
And this is really just
important to ensure

77
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,033
that we're all starting on the same page

78
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,033
and you can follow along smoothly.

79
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,666
Now, as I said, in the next lecture,

80
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,166
I'll walk you through
these folders and files.

81
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,000
For the moment, I just want to make sure

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,066
that we can start this project here

83
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,966
as an application on an emulator,

84
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:16,666
and you can use either the
iOS or Android emulator,

85
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,833
but since everyone,
including Windows users

86
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,866
will be able to use Android emulators,

87
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,433
I'll go for that.

88
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,966
So just as in the previous core section,

89
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,700
I'll quickly spin up an emulator again.

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,833
Of course, you might still have one

91
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,433
from the last section and then
you can absolutely use that.

92
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:39,266
So, here I'll just quickly
set up that emulator.

93
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:42,633
And once that emulator
is up and running here,

94
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:46,866
we can run our Flutter
app on that emulator,

95
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,200
either by using that terminal,

96
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,366
which you can open with
terminal, new terminal,

97
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,400
and running "flutter run".

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,633
Or better, as you learned in
the previous core section,

99
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:02,033
by going to "run," "run
without debugging."

100
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,166
And then this should automatically run it.

101
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:10,966
Now you might get this
dropdown where you have

102
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,533
to choose how you want
to run your project.

103
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,866
And here, I will choose Dart and Flutter.

104
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:21,866
And then this will run your
application on Android,

105
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,566
on the Android emulator and build it

106
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:27,100
as an Android app automatically since we

107
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,800
do have this Android
emulator up and running here.

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,066
Now, the first time you run this,

109
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,033
as you saw in the previous core section

110
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,966
can take a bit longer.

111
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,266
But once this is finished,

112
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,333
we should have this counter app running

113
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,333
on the Android emulator again.

114
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,800
And then we can use this
control panel up here

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,200
to reload this app whenever
we need to do that.

116
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,866
But as I showed you in
the last core section,

117
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,433
whenever you change your code

118
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,366
and you save your code changes,

119
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:57,366
the great thing about this
way of running the Flutter app

120
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,966
is that it will automatically reload

121
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,200
whenever you change your code.

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,766
So, let's now wait for this to start up.

123
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,766
And here we go, here's this application.

124
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:13,266
And again, if it just started,
it might still be a bit slow,

125
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,533
but it should get more responsive quickly.

126
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:18,600
And then you can play around with it here,

127
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,666
and edit your code here.

128
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,266
And therefore that's now what we're going

129
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,266
to do for all the discourse section.

130
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,500
In the next lecture,

131
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,266
we'll explore the files
and folders we got here

132
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,233
and what they do.
