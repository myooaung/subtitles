1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,820
You can visit Firebase Google.com to create new Firebase projects and also to learn more about Firebase.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,690
Now, Firebase is a service by Google and it consists of a lot of different products.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,050
As you can see, if you click on products, a lot of features built in.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,520
We'll see some of those features.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,360
We'll see those most important features, so to say, in action here.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,780
And if you click on pricing, you will see that you can start for free, but depending on which features

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:38,670
you're going to use, you might need a paid plan which also initially is free, but where you can occur

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,840
costs if you then use certain services to a certain extent and you can see all the details here on the

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,870
pricing page there, you'll learn what's free and what costs money and if there is any free tier.

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,910
For example, for authentication, you see that some services cost money, but you also have a certain

11
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,980
free tier so you can use them for free.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,489
And only if you exceed this, you pay basically.

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,640
And that's true for all those services.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
There are certain free tiers and from a certain point on you're going to pay and you should definitely

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,790
check this pricing page before you build any real app.

16
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,580
Therefore, now what we're going to do in this module should be covered by the free tier.

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,780
But of course if you are already using some other Firebase projects altogether, they might be exceeding

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,920
those free tiers.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,570
So they are free.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,370
You should definitely check your usage and make sure that you don't occur any unexpected costs.

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,790
With that, let's go to the Firebase console and for that you will need a Google account.

22
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,350
So make sure that you do create one or that you sign in with your existing one.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
Now, once you logged in, you can add a new project.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,440
And first of all, you need to pick a name here and I will name it flutter chat, but the name is totally

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,160
up to you.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,870
Next click Continue and here you can choose if you want to add Google Analytics to your project and

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,840
I will leave it turned on though technically we won't really need it here, so let's click continue.

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,890
Select an account if you are getting prompted for.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,310
We're a Google Analytics account.

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,140
So I did that here and I will now create that project.

31
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,360
Now this can take a few seconds or maybe even minutes, but it should be fairly quick.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,230
And this will now set up a Firebase Project and then forward us to a web console where we can manage

33
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,720
that project and where you will be able to manage and monitor those different services you might be

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,380
using.

35
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,660
So let's wait for that to finish up.

36
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,350
Here it is.

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,360
Let's continue.

38
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,720
And here we are in this Web console.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,870
Now, here you see your Firebase project.

40
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,010
And on the left you see the different services that are offered by Firebase.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,620
Now, in this module, we're going to have a look at authentication and database and storage, and we'll

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,870
also have a look at the cloud functions and add push notifications, which we don't see here, but which

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,430
also are included.

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,960
You see them here with cloud messaging?

45
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,320
Now you can manage your plan down there and switch to a paid plan, which you might need to do if you

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,790
exceed certain limits.

47
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,060
And here under the gear icon, you can also manage your project and views on configuration data.

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,090
We might need and in general manage your project, though we will do that together as the need arises.

49
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:48,240
Now, what we need to do right away here to get started is we want to add our Flutter app to this Firebase

50
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,670
Project so that we can tap into Firebase with help of our Flutter app.

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,430
And for that we either add an iOS or Android app here, depending on which kind of app you're building.

52
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,130
Of course, you can also add both.

53
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,820
Now, I'm currently previewing this here on Android, so I will click on Android here to start with

54
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,500
that and connect my Firebase Project here to this Flutter app.

55
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,420
Now we get this wizard here and I will show you iOS in a second, by the way.

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,410
But let's start with that.

57
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,120
So we get this wizard and first of all, we need to enter our Android package name here.

58
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,640
Now you see that this is the application ID you find in your build gradle file.

59
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:37,110
So we can go to the Android folder and there go into the app folder and there this build gradle file.

60
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,490
Here.

61
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,210
It's this application ID which you should find in this file.

62
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,150
Now you can also change this project right in your Flutter project and then choose any identifier of

63
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,690
your choice.

64
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,520
Here I will go for the default one.

65
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,590
You can assign a nickname if you want to, which you then see in the Firebase console.

66
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,150
But I will not do that here.

67
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,640
We don't need that signing certificate here.

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,970
And therefore we can just click register app now.

69
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:18,970
Next, we should download this Google Services JSON file and then drag it into your Android app folder.

70
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,450
So next to that build gradle file we just had a look at.

71
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,560
So let's download this and here I'm in the Android folder and in that app folder there I will download

72
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,650
that Google Services dot Jason file.

73
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,810
Let's move on to the next step and now add the Firebase SDK.

74
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,470
Now for that, you should actually follow the steps that are shown here.

75
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,800
Go to your project level, build on Gradle file, which is this one here, and make sure that you have

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,980
Google here in your repositories node.

77
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,240
So here in build script repositories, you should have Google and we already have that here but verify

78
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,200
that it is there.

79
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,340
Also under all projects repositories dear you should always make sure that you have Google.

80
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,460
You can have more than that, but make sure you have Google at least.

81
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,210
Now, all to make sure you add this line here and you can just click that copy button here.

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,680
This line here to the dependencies in your build script node.

83
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,170
So here's the build script.

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Here are the dependencies.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,990
And make sure you add this class path here, which I just copied and save the file thereafter.

86
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,530
Next in the app level builds gradle file.

87
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,330
So the build gradle file in your app folder.

88
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,650
There you should make sure that all those entries are added.

89
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,380
So under build gradle here.

90
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:56,180
If you scroll down a bit, you should already see this plugin com android application, so that should

91
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,200
already be there.

92
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,750
But you should also add this Google Services plugin.

93
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,300
You can add it right below there.

94
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,530
And of course, make sure that you have this line added to your dependencies.

95
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,630
So if you scroll down.

96
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,330
Here's the dependencies.

97
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:24,460
And there at the end we can add this service or this line, save that file and you're done.

98
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,740
You can skip that step here.

99
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,000
You're done already.

100
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,670
So now here it's going to check whether that works.

101
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,600
But it should work.

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,520
And this kennel reports that it doesn't work because you might need to uninstall and reinstall Europe.

103
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,130
But we'll see if it works soon because we're soon going to add the Flutter Firebase SDK, which is going

104
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,690
to communicate with Firebase.

105
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,210
And there we will see whether it works or not.

106
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,760
Now, that was the Android setup.

107
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,980
Now, if you develop on a Linux or Windows machine, you can now jump ahead to the next lecture.

108
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,400
But if you're on a mac OS system, you can of course also configure Firebase to work with iOS.

109
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,910
So let's do that next.

110
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,920
So therefore I'll skip this step.

111
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,710
I'm back here in the console and I will click Add app here to also add the iOS app.

112
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,160
Now here we need the iOS bundle ID and we can find this bundle identifier in the general tab of our

113
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,100
apps, primary target and Xcode as we see.

114
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:32,190
So therefore I opened the iOS folder of my project here with Xcode and if I click on Runner here under

115
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,090
General.

116
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,370
It's this panel identifier which we now need.

117
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,559
And I'll change to actually to.

118
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,370
Flatter chattier.

119
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,010
We're actually.

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,490
I'll change it to the same identifier I had in the android folder.

121
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,530
So app build gradle there.

122
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,950
I had.

123
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,620
This identifier and I'll use this in Xcode too.

124
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,750
You might already have the same if you don't.

125
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,660
Maybe make sure that you do have the same identifiers.

126
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,870
Now this is the bundle identifier, which I now also add here on Firebase.

127
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,290
However, for iOS, of course it doesn't like underscores.

128
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,090
I keep forgetting that.

129
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:28,780
So let's make sure we remove all those underscores here so that we have this identifier and we have

130
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,160
the same identifier here on Firebase.

131
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,330
Now, just as before, we can add a nickname if we want to.

132
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,670
We can add an app store ID if we want to.

133
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,330
I don't want to do either of that here, so I'll just register this app.

134
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,480
And as a next step, we have to download the Google Service Info List file here.

135
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,720
So I'll download this.

136
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,290
And I'll add it in this runner folder in my iOS project.

137
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,940
So next to App Delegate and so on.

138
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,420
I'll add this file and save it there.

139
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,090
And now you can click next.

140
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:12,260
But because we're going to use the Flutter Firebase SDK, you should not add this Firebase SDK like

141
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,410
this, so you should not follow the instructions here.

142
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,430
You should also not follow the instructions here in ad initialization code.

143
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,320
Instead.

144
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,430
We're already done with adding our project here and therefore we can go back.

145
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,570
And now here we have our iOS project, we have our Android project set up in our Firebase Project.

146
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,300
So we connected this Firebase Project to our iOS and Android app, and now we're going to use the Firebase

147
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,090
Flutter SDK and get started with that in the next lecture to finish up this connection and to be able

148
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,980
to communicate between our Flutter app and this Firebase backend.
