00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.170
So we had a couple of nice effects here,

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.200
what's missing or what we can also do is here on the orders screen, when we expand the details here

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.800
of course you could also animate that in. Now for this, we'll again animate the container

4
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.260
and since we did that before, of course feel free to try it on your own first before we thereafter do

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.510
it together.

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.610
In the end, you shouldn't be more than just the animate container.

7
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.350
So here's your chance to pause the video and try this on your own and thereafter, we'll do it together. Were

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.310
you successful?

9
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.950
Let's do together. Our order items are controlled here in the widgets folder, in the order_item.dart file

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.580
and in there, we render this card for the order item.

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.340
Now the goal is simple, that card now has to be wrapped with a new widget and that should be our animated

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.880
container, so that we can animate the height of this card over time. The time is totally up to you and

13
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.020
you configure it with the duration argument and the duration object and I'll stick to the good old 300

14
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.810
milliseconds but of course, you can use a different duration.

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.970
Now the height is the thing which should change and of course, it should change when we change

16
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:23.030
the expanded mode. So let's take expanded here as a trigger so to say and then switch between two different

17
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.720
values, to be precise,

18
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.710
actually I want to use the calculation I have down there because that is how that height should change.

19
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.810
So I'll again use my min calculation here and if we're expanded, then I'll run this calculation and otherwise

20
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.130
I'll use a fallback value of let's say 95 and we'll have to play around with these values to get a

21
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.840
feeling for what looks good.

22
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.560
Now we have another container and that's the container here in the if statement. The if statement should

23
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.750
be removed and this container should now also be replaced with an animated container

24
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.810
because that's the container which actually also should animate because it shows us the items

25
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.880
that are part of this order. I'll set this here to the same duration, 300 milliseconds and we are already

26
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.020
controlling the height here

27
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.680
but of course the height now also needs to change dynamically

28
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.300
there. If we're in expanded mode, then I want to use this height here,

29
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.340
otherwise a height of zero because this container should be fully not there

30
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.320
if we're not expanded. The main container out there should always have a base height even if we're not

31
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.140
expanded because it does show us some information, like the price and the date here even if it's not

32
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:55.490
expanded. Let's give it a try, let's save that and this does not have the effect I wanted simply because

33
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.030
the outer container is too small and that makes sense. Here, that main container that wraps the entire

34
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.610
card, when we're in an expanded mode, I take the smaller value of either 100 or of this dynamic

35
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.670
calculation, of course that has to be too small, here we should maybe go to 110 and here

36
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.560
to 200 because that needs to be bigger than the inner container and certainly needs to be bigger

37
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.530
than our base value here because the base value is in not expanded mode if we had 100 here as a

38
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.550
minimum in expanded mode, it makes sense that we don't fit anything in there. So let's save that and now this

39
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.390
actually looks quite nice,

40
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.650
this now has a nice look when we expand this and when we shrink this, a nice little animation which you

41
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.070
of course can finetune to your requirements if you want to but I'd say this is a nice animation and

42
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.630
of course as you saw, this also always means that you have to play around with the values a little bit

43
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.210
to find the configuration that looks good, feels good and plays the animation in a smooth way.
