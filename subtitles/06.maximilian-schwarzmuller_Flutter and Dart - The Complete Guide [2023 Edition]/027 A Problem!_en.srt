1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,390
That's happening because when you have an item here in favorites like this schnitzel,

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,680
and you then go into the detail page and you now uncheck this as a favorite,

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:24,340
if you now go back, you go back to basically a cached version of that page.

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:32,560
This was not reached by the rebuild of the Flutter apps so to say because it was cached away. Only if

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,010
you go to a different page and then come back, Flutter recreates that page and now updates this based

6
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,120
on the most recent state where this indeed isn't favorite anymore.

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:52,510
Now what can we do to avoid showing outdated data on our favoritesScreen therefore? For the moment,

8
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,440
this is the way it is and there's no super simple or clean way of solving this,

9
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,690
however it will be super clean and easy to solve once we have learned more about state management which

10
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:12,100
will generally help us with managing global data, like we're managing it here in our main.dart file. When

11
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,680
we use the main.dart file for managing that, we run into problems like this and we also have the problem

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,460
of always rebuilding the entire app with every change.

13
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,230
These are all problems that will be solved with a better state management tool, which is why we'll have

14
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,650
a look at such a tool in the next course

15
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:36,580
section. Dirty fixes which you could apply right now would for example be that you turn your favoritesScreen

16
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:44,110
into a stateful widget, you handle the pushing of a meal item here in that favorites screen widget

17
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,840
instead of the meal item widget,

18
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:52,060
so you would have to have a function here and pass a handle to that function, to meal item and then with

19
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:01,660
the then listener on your push or pushNamed call, you could run some code when that recipe detail page

20
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,259
we're on that meal detail page is popped off and in that code you then run, since this would be a stateful

21
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,370
widget here,

22
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:17,620
you could call set state with no content in it to force an update of this screen but this would be a

23
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,930
really dirty work around which is why I won't cover it here,

24
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,290
instead we'll learn about a way cleaner approach in the next section.

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:33,040
This section here however now is done and you learned a lot about navigation, passing data back and forth

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,540
and as a side note, about building a beautiful application.
