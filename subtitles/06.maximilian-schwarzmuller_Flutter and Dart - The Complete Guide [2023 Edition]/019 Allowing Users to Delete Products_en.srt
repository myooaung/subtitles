1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,180
Deleting products isn't too hard actually,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,550
we first of all need to add a method in our products provider file where we have add and update product.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,960
There we now need a delete product method

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,780
and of course it makes sense that we get the ID of the product which should be deleted as an input.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,560
And then deleting here is really straightforward,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,760
we can reach out to our items, so to all the products we stored here and call remove where

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,950
to execute a function on every product there

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,760
and if it returns true, it's a product that should be removed

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,640
and of course we will return true if the ID of the product we're looking at in our list of products

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,190
is equal to the ID we're getting here

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,020
as an argument. In that case, this will be removed from the list, all other items will be kept

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,530
and of course we should call notify listeners to update all places in the app that would care.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,630
Now we can call delete product from inside user products, from the user products screen. There,

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,740
we set up a listener to our products and this should be a listener because I want to rebuild my list 

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,060
if products change and with that here on the user product item, we can now get rid of the product.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,140
So in user product item, here when this trash button is clicked, I want to clear my product and for that,

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,690
we have actually two options,

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:33,190
either we receive a callback function, so a function which we store in a variable which is passed in

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,840
through the constructor, which we pass in therefore through this constructor here and therefore we

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,860
have to function for deleting the product in the user products screen.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,450
We could do that because we already have access to the products data through the provider here,

22
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,390
so it would be super easy to call delete product here but it's also not too hard to use a different

23
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:00,700
approach and in the user product item widget, we can of course also use the provider package, so use package

24
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:14,400
provider/provider.dart and also get access to our products.dart file here and then here on the delete

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:23,370
button, we can use provider of, get access to products, forward the context and then call delete product

26
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,090
for the product ID which we already have as a property in this widget because we're already getting

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,040
it as an argument.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,200
Now one important note, here of course I don't want to listen to changes, so I'll set listen to false

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,530
here,

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:46,630
I only use this place to dispatch this action. And with that if we save this and do a full refresh and

31
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,770
go back to our products,

32
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,390
if I delete the yellow scarf, indeed it's gone and it's still gone

33
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,420
if I go to the shop and I go back because I really removed it from my list of products. Now of course,

34
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,860
it's only temporarily gone,

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,780
as soon as we restart the app it's back because we're not saving our data on any server or anything

36
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,560
like that

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,400
but this proves that this generally works

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,440
and with that we have a setup where we are able to interact with user input, we're able to validate the

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,910
user input, create new products, edit products, delete products and also show some helpful messages, like

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,950
for example the messages we're showing here when we add something to the cart where we can also undo

41
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:33,820
this or if we have something in the cart and we want to delete this or we can stop that. These hopefully

42
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,790
are all things that are helpful to you in your next steps.
