1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,260
So when this button is pressed, the current location button, I want to go ahead and fetch the user location.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:15,640
For that, in the location input widget, we can add a new method which will eventually return a future

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,780
that will then resolve to nothing though, I named this _getCurrentUserLocation or anything like

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,850
that, the name is up to you, doesn't take any arguments but will work with async code and I want to use that

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,980
async await syntax, hence the async keyword here and hence this returns a future.

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,780
Now here, we can use the location package. So for that,

7
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,680
let's import package location and then location.dart,

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,760
this package we installed and we can now instantiate location here, like that

9
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:57,160
and then call get location on that instance. Now get location yields a future which then eventually

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,050
will give us the location data, since that data is probably what we're interested in,

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:08,050
I'll store it in a constant, locData and await this future here.

12
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,410
So with that, we got the location data,

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,580
let me now simply print locData and there, we'll have a latitude and also a longitude field and that's

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,380
of course exactly what we need because as I mentioned at the beginning of this module, with the latitude

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,290
and longitude, we can perfectly describe any location on the world.

16
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,270
So let's now take this method here and connect it to this button here, to the current location button by

17
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,130
pointing at it,

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,140
so don't execute it here, just point at the method.

19
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,780
Save this

20
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:47,040
and now let's go back here and click current location, this button and I'm asked here whether I want

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,130
to grant access and I do so I click allow here and in your debug log, you should see these coordinates.

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,490
Now side note, that is not where I sit, on the Android emulator, you by default get the location of the Google

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,980
headquarters in Silicon Valley, so or of the Googleplex there.

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,669
So these are the two location pieces

25
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:18,160
and now of course, we can use that to display that location on a map with the help of that map image

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,140
which I mentioned could be generated by Google.

27
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,600
So that's the next step,

28
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,290
turn that pair of coordinates here into a map preview.
