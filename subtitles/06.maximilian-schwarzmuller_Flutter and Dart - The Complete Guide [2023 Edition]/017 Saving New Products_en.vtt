00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.200
So to save when you product, we first of all have to go to products, to our products class where we manage

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.700
our list of products

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.560
and there we have an add product method which right now doesn't do anything.

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.440
Now my expectation here is that I get a product, the product which should be added which is missing an

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.940
ID though.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.220
Now later, we'll send that product to a server and generates the ID on the server,

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.730
for the moment, I'll create a dummy ID here. For that,

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.120
I'll create a new product which since I can't edit the properties of product is a new product object

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.430
and there, I take all my product data or the title for example which I got here on the product I received

10
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.090
as an argument, so do that for the title, for the description and for the price

11
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.220
and imageUrl

12
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.880
and of course now set the ID to datetime.now

13
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.430
to string to have this kind of unique ID for now until we have a better one

14
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.340
and with that new product created, we can add it to our items.

15
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.010
So here I'll call items and add my new product,

16
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.760
alternatively you could also use items insert zero and then your new product to add it at the beginning

17
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.050
of the list

18
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.890
but I'm fine with the end, so I will go with add

19
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.970
and then of course, notify listeners to let the app know that you added a new product.

20
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.430
So now we can call add product in our products provider or in that provided object and therefore back

21
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.190
in the edit product screen, in _saveForm, instead of printing all this stuff here,

22
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.340
the goal is to now call that add product method.

23
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.160
Now for this, we can use provider of products and for this of course, we need to make sure that we import

24
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.210
the products class here from the providers folder and there, from the products.dart file,

25
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.400
so this import needs to be added

26
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.920
and then here, we can call provider of products and forward the context, context just like widget is

27
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.950
available everywhere in your state object if you remember.

28
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.280
So we have that context of the attached widget available

29
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.840
and for provider to be available, we of course need to import the provider package and there, simply

30
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.640
provider.dart. So with that, we get access to our provider.

31
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.600
Now I will set listen to false here because here, I'm not interested in changes to my products,

32
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.470
I just want to dispatch an action, I want to call add product and there, forward my edited product which

33
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.860
contains all that data we're gathering right, edited product is that property we're managing or we're

34
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:12.120
initializing here which we're then updating when we call save on the form with all these onSaved methods

35
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.240
here or events here on all the inputs. So with that, we can call add product and forward the edited product

36
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.340
and then let's say I also want to leave this page, so I can use navigator of context pop and

37
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.930
this will go back to the previous page which shows us all products. If you add this logic and you go

38
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.030
back to your app, we can test this, add a new product here,

39
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:44.580
this is a test and here, simply enter a URL. Hit enter, this worked and here's our new item at the bottom of

40
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.360
the list.

41
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.770
So adding products like this works, let's now make sure we can also edit them.
