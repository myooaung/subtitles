1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,860
I already showed you that you can hit command or control and hover over the things that you're interested

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,210
in and click on them to have a look at the source code for these things and that can be helpful for

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,610
understanding what happens internally

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,620
if you're interested in that. 

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,020
Now of course, you also might be wondering what can I configure on the widget, what's the idea behind

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,740
a widget and which widgets do exist and that can also be answered. For this, the official documentation

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,330
is a great place, you find it on flutter.dev and there, you can click on docs.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,980
Now here, you have a bunch of general documentation which can be interesting and you also have the

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,940
widgets catalog.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,520
Now here you see a lot of categories for widgets and for example, you can have a look at layout widgets

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,470
to find all the widgets that help you with positioning other widgets.

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,150
Here you find information about the container, you also will find information about the column and

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,370
the row if you scroll down. Here you can read more about that if you're interested and you can always

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,480
click on a widget there to find a more detailed explanation, here for container it's pretty vast, a pretty

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,020
extensive documentation, some widgets also have shorter docs and then you can scroll down to maybe

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,210
find some examples,

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,790
not all widgets have examples but quite a lot of them have it

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,490
and if you scroll even further, you see the properties that exist, the different constructors that exists,

19
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,720
if there is more than one, you would see it here and you can always click on all these things to learn

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,400
more about that. So that also is something that's worth exploring

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,750
if you're stuck, if you need a certain behavior in your application or if you want to look up something.

22
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,990
So that's also something I would always recommend that you be aware of and that you dive into and with

23
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:57,340
that, that's enough of Dart and technical background for the moment. Again and I'm really just emphasizing

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,800
this because it is a lot of new content to digest,

25
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,910
if one or the other thing is unclear, we'll go through all of that throughout this course,

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,180
no worries.

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,650
So for the moment, we have our own custom stateless widget.

28
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,620
It receives external data,

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,760
it changes when that data changes and therefore the UI rebuilds this widget if that data changes and

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,050
we added our first basic styling and positioning here.

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:32,860
So our app is slowly taking shape but more importantly, we already learned a lot of important core functionalities

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,740
and behaviors of Flutter and Dart.

33
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,850
Let's continue that road.
