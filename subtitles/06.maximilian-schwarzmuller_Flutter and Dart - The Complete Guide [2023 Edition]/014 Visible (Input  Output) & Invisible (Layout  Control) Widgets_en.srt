00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:09,010
In this first, a little bit more realistic application, I want to build a very simple personality quiz

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:17,530
application where you answer a couple of questions and based on the choices you made, we charge your personality.

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,150
For that, we'll use that current application we have here, this very lean application where we right

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,259
now only output the default text and we'll build up on that to present a question and some buttons that

5
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,860
allow the user to choose an answer.

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,520
Now for that, we certainly need a text widget to output the question and below that, I want to have

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,090
a couple of buttons that allow the user to choose different answers

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,480
and now here's a problem. We have

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,560
body and body is the place where we add the widget that should be shown in all that white area

10
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,680
and body only takes one widget,

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,870
I can't add a second widget here, I can't add another text, second text. You already see I get an error

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:11,260
here because now this would actually not be passed as an additional value to body But Dart would try

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,170
to pass this as a positional argument passed to scaffold which doesn't take any positional arguments

14
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,760
here.

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,080
So that does not work

16
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,970
and we also can't concatenate this by adding a plus here,

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,530
all of that doesn't work.

18
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,260
We can really only pass one widget here to body

19
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,830
so what can we do?

20
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,420
I want to pass more than one widget, I want to have a text and a couple of buttons.

21
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,510
For this, it's important to understand

22
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,710
that we have different types of widgets in Flutter.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,950
We have the visible widgets which are related to user input and to outputting data, things like a button

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,650
or a text or a card

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,850
and we have only seen the text from all these examples here thus far but there are more widgets like

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,650
the RaisedButton which renders a button and other widgets and we'll see all of those throughout

27
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,970
the course.

28
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,740
Now these are the widgets which we see,

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,780
we see a button,

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,050
we see the text right,

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,990
that is what we see and that is of course crucial for any application

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:17,170
but equally crucial are invisible widgets that help us with layout and with controlling how our widget

33
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,780
tree behaves and how it looks like and there we got things like row, column, ListView and so on.

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,020
These are also widgets that ship with Flutter which we don't have to build ourselves, which we don't

35
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:38,380
see themselves but which help us with structuring our content. So these widgets give our app structure and

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:45,510
control how visible widgets are drawn onto the screen and therefore of course, they're super important.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,490
There also is a very important widget which also ships with Flutter, the container widget which kind

38
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,550
of belongs into both categories as you will learn once we use it because it by default is invisible

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,680
but you can also give it some styling so that you can see it

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,170
but before we focus on that, let's actually take row, column and so on to work on our quiz app and add both a

41
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,840
question and a couple of answer buttons.
