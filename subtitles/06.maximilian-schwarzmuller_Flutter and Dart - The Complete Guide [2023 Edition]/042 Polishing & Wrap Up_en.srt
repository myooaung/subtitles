1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,740
So now that the application is finished and all the features are integrated, it's time for some final

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,640
polishing.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,640
For example, there's one mistake I made in the chat screen dart file.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,220
Super in its state should go to the beginning of that function.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,570
To the beginning of that method.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,320
I should say.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,100
It's not super bad.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,950
As you saw, everything works.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,920
But it is a better practice to call this first, so make sure to put super in it state at the beginning

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,380
in every in its state method you might have.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,820
So that's the first thing.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,120
Now, in addition here on the chat screen, it's hard to see here, but you might see it in your local

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,630
app.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,210
There is a little gray bar at the bottom of this dropdown button here.

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:53,020
Now, if I go to the chat screen there, I have this dropdown button.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,480
There is an underline option and underlined argument which we can set.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,590
And you might think that this takes a number to define the width of the line at the bottom, but actually

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:11,120
it wants a widget that will be rendered as a underline, and you see that by default that's a 0.0 width

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,170
bottom border with in the end, grayish color.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,270
Now, even though it has this width, it seems like we're seeing it here.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,410
So let's try setting this to an empty container.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,740
If a now safe test, this is entirely gone.

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,990
So now we don't have this ugly border anymore.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,330
So that's another fix that makes sense here.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,650
Now, if we do log out, we also get some issues or some potential improvements here on this.

26
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,980
Log in or sign up for them.

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,480
So let's go to that off form here.

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,660
The the form generally works, but these text fields could be configured a bit differently, for example,

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,350
on the email field here.

30
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,900
I'm not too happy with how it behaves with a real keyboard.

31
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,570
To be precise, I want to turn off autocorrect here.

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,540
I always find this annoying on email addresses when it tries to fix what you entered.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,140
I always want to control the text capitalization, which means how it tries to turn certain characters

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,700
to uppercase characters.

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:21,440
And there I want to set this to text capitalization non, which means it's not going to capitalize anything.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,110
And with enable suggestions faults.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,720
I'll also turn off any suggestions here because I also find this annoying on email addresses.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,920
Now on the user name here, that's a bit different there.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,870
I want auto correction, I want capitalization on a word level so that words are capitalized, let's

40
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,320
say.

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,020
And I still don't want suggestions though.

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,370
And of course you can pick different settings, but these are the settings I'm going to choose.

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,510
Now for the password.

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,920
Everything seemed to work correctly for me, so I won't change anything there.

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,230
Now with that, let me log in real quick here.

46
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:10,060
And all to work on that message field down there, because by default this will only produce lowercase

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,840
words.

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,680
So we'll go to that chat screen now to the new message widget.

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,590
I mean, and there we have that text field.

50
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,520
And on that text field, all set.

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,140
Text capitalization to text capitalization.

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,640
Let's say.

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,590
Sentences, I'll turn on auto corrections.

54
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,260
And I will also turn on the suggestions.

55
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,110
So enable suggestions set to true.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,090
And with that, if that rebuilds and I reload this app, if I tap into this again, you'll see.

57
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,400
Now it starts with a capital character and then I can type and only if I end a sentence.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,120
It starts with a new capital character, so that looks better to me as well.

59
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,360
And then there is one last thing which is hard to see.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,840
If you restart the app entirely.

61
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,700
So if I kill this here.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,730
And I restart the app.

63
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,980
We briefly see the login screen before we are forwarded to the chat screen and the reason for that simply

64
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,640
is that the Firebase authentication package needs a couple of milliseconds to find out whether we have

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,230
a valid token or not.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,750
So of course, that's also not ideal.

67
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,990
And therefore I add a new screen, I'll add a splash screen, which is essentially a loading screen

68
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,960
I want to show whilst the authentication package is figuring out what's going on.

69
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:49,720
So that can be a simple stateless widget which will name splash screen and where we need to import material

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,770
to start.

71
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:59,470
And here I simply want to render a scaffold so that we have a nice background and so on, where as a

72
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,550
body I simply have some centered text, let's say, so simply some centered text where we say loading.

73
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,450
And of course you could also show a loading spinner instead or do whatever you want.

74
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,300
You can show whatever you want here and now.

75
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:20,620
The idea is that we can show this splash screen instead of the chat or off screen if we don't know yet

76
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,480
if the user is authenticated.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
So we can simply go to Main Dart.

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:34,630
And here before we check whether we have data, we can check on our user snapshot if the connection

79
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,690
state is equal to connection state waiting, which means we're still figuring out whether the user is

80
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,980
authenticated or not.

81
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,270
And if it is waiting, we just return the splash screen here.

82
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,290
And of course, for that you need to import the splash screen into that main dart file.

83
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,690
So now with that, I'm going to rerun this application.

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,220
And kill it first.

85
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,520
And now when it launches this application here, we hopefully now see the splash screen instead of the

86
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,170
flickering off screen.

87
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,450
So let's see what we get here.

88
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,840
And that looks better to me.

89
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,480
There was the loading text for a fraction of a second before we were forwarded here.

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,170
Now, I think another tiny improvement is that on the splash screen on this scaffold, we may be able

91
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,990
to set the background color to our main theme color, to our primary color, so that we have like this

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,440
pinkish background color there as well.

93
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,000
So if I now kill this.

94
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,790
And rebuild and rerun this year.

95
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,700
We should now see that this splash screen actually has this pinkish background color.

96
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,390
Now, that will not be our main application start up launch screen.

97
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,780
I show how to configure that in the deployment section.

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:59,470
This really is just the in app screen which is shown whilst we are waiting for the Firebase off package

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,650
to figure out if the user is authenticated or not.

100
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,970
So that's something different.

101
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,450
Yeah.

102
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,280
And you can find you this however you want.

103
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,950
But I would say with that we got all those improvements in place that really make this a great app with

104
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,660
a lot of nice features.
