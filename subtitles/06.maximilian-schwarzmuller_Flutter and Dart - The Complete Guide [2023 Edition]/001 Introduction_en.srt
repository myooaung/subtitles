00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,530
Welcome to this course.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,900
I'm extremely happy to welcome you on board.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,980
In this course you will learn, flutter and dart from scratch.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,170
No prior knowledge is required.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,900
We'll start at the important basics and then work our way through all the core features up to more advanced

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,090
topics like working with native device features, the flutter internals, state management and much

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,630
more.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,450
This course is fully up to date and as I do it with all my courses, I will keep this course up to date

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,180
and you will learn all the things, not just in theory, but in an example driven, project focused

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,720
way.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,210
We'll build multiple apps throughout this course so that you have concrete examples of how and when

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,820
to apply a certain feature, and you will learn all the things by applying features on your own.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,410
You can follow along and code along, and by the end of the course you will have built multiple apps

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,300
and you will be well prepared to build your own apps with the knowledge gained in this course.

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,730
This course also has tons of quizzes and a lot of attached documents that allow you to dive deeper and

16
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,840
check your knowledge.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,730
Now, in addition, you get Q&A support in case you should get stuck, and therefore, I'm convinced

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,090
that this course will turn you into a real flutter developer.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,680
Now, who am I?

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,930
My name is Maximum Schwarzman, and I'm a five star rated instructor here on Udemy.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,000
I got multiple bestselling courses, and this course here also is the Bestselling Lover Course, and

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,010
I'm super excited about the letter.

23
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,830
I'm working with it since it's early Alpha days, which actually already are a couple of years ago,

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,080
and I enjoy working with Flutter.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,110
It's an amazing technology which allows you to build amazing mobile apps and I can't wait to dive into

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,130
that together with you.

27
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,130
So I guess let's get started and let's dive into the most important question what exactly is Flutter?
