00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.200
Passing our function down to the answer

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.750
buttons

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.420
works. As a next step, I want to make sure that we show some meaningful text here instead of always answer

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.010
1

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.740
and as a little stylistic thing, I want to adjust the text color and

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.160
we can do this by setting the text color argument on the RaisedButton and there, we can set this to 

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.970
colors.white, again colors is this utility class which groups a bunch of predefined color codes so

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.870
to say and I assign this color code to text color which will unsurprisingly color this text white.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.010
But now let's make sure we have different texts here which we pass down

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.080
and for that, our question here now has to become a bit more complex because now a question should not

11
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.660
just be a string,

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.850
the question itself, it should also contain information about the available answers.

13
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.940
Now of course as long as our question is just a string, we can't put any additional info in there other

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.620
than the question text.

15
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.850
So what we need now in here is a more complex object which can group multiple pieces of information

16
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.550
together, the text for the question but also the texts for the answers

17
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.220
and what could be used for that?

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.140
We could create a new class which has all these features we need and use that class to create objects

19
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.950
here and that would be a perfectly liable way of managing this, would be perfectly fine.

20
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.230
However since you're also taking this course to learn a little bit about Dart, I'll actually show you

21
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.860
a different data structure that's also built into Dart which can also be useful if you have relatively

22
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.690
trivial data structures which yet are more complex than just some text

23
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.930
and that would be a map.

24
00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.740
You create a map with curly braces or by using the map class like this

25
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.990
but let's use the curly brace syntax.

26
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.850
So it's a little bit like a list which you create with square brackets but a map now is not a list of

27
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.910
values but instead a collection of key-value pairs.

28
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.120
You have a key to identify a value,

29
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.360
for example here, you could have the question text key and you put the key between quotes, double or

30
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.190
single quotes,

31
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.890
doesn't matter,

32
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.170
just be consistent

33
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.450
and then the value is assigned by adding a colon after the key and then you have your value, in this

34
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.910
case it's also a string but your value could be anything, could be a number, could be another map, could

35
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.980
be a list,

36
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.780
really any value can be used in here.

37
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.870
The key also doesn't have to be a string,

38
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.380
you could also have a number as a key, like one but often you will have strings because then you have a

39
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.380
very human readable way of accessing the different pieces of information in that map.

40
00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.890
So now, one question here in our list of questions is no longer a string but instead a map and that map

41
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.620
right now has a question text but now it shouldn't just have a question text, it should also have a list

42
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.010
of answers and therefore, I'll add a comma to add another key-value pair to this map and I'll name this

43
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.880
key now

44
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.580
answers. These key names of course are totally up to you and now answers won't be a string but instead

45
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.690
a list,

46
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.310
as I mentioned, your values in the map can be anything. In this list,

47
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.360
I now want to have a list of answer texts which we can display and here we could have since I'm

48
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.950
asking for the favorite color,

49
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.700
we could have let's say black,

50
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.570
we also could have red, green and white here,

51
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.660
you could add more but I want to have four answers let's say

52
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:57.260
and with that if we now reformat this, we have this map with a question text and with an answer in here.

53
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.990
Now of course, I want to have more than one question in the quiz,

54
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:09.290
so I'll duplicate this and also add my second question here as a question text in the second map here,

55
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.720
remove that double quote at the end and then at the beginning and here my answer texts could be,

56
00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:23.830
since I'm asking for animals, here I could be asking for a rabbit,

57
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:37.080
a snake, an elephant and let's say a lion and let's add one more question here by copying and pasting in

58
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.220
this map one more time and here, I'll ask for

59
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:52.930
who is your favorite instructor and I want to offer a couple of totally objective choices here

60
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.640
because that could be Max,

61
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.620
Max,

62
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.710
Max or Max.

63
00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.530
Okay

64
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.750
of course enter whatever you want here.

65
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.160
So these are my three questions

66
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.520
and now we're using a map here, which just like everything else, every other value, is of course based

67
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.200
on an object, it's based on on the map class which is built into Dart, so map is a class built into Dart.

68
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.110
This is just a shorthand way of creating it, just as you have square brackets for lists

69
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.210
and it's perfect if you have more complex data which you want to manage as key-value pairs like we have

70
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.270
it here, where you could create your own class and your own object but if it is just such a simple collection

71
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.090
of key-value pairs, creating a custom class in object might be overkill, though you absolutely could do

72
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:48.140
it of course but it might be overkill and therefore creating such a little map here on the fly kind

73
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.420
of can be very nice and helpful.
