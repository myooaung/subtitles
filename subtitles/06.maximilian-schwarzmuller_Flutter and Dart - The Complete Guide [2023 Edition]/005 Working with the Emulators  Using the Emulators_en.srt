1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,170
So you learned how to launch the app on different simulators and devices. For the majority of the course,

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,620
I will work with the emulators and there, mostly with the Android emulator simply because Android is

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,650
the system everyone is able to follow along,

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,160
iOS apps can only be developed on macOS systems and not every student has a macOS system available.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,920
So Android will be the focus of this course or the Android simulator will be the focus I should say,

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,670
we will nonetheless build apps for both platforms and since we'll work a lot with simulators, you should

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,020
know how to use them. For the Android simulator,

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:48,080
you have this control panel here on the right where you for example can rotate the device.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,980
Now important, to also apply the rotation effect here,

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:59,000
you need to open your settings, your scroll down, bring up that status bar on the emulator and

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,320
make sure that device rotation is turned on. With that, by pressing these buttons, you can simulate that

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,700
the device is rotated and then also confirm that your user interface looks good in landscape mode.

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,640
Of course in this course, I'll also extensively cover how you can render different user interfaces, different

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,190
layouts for different device sizes and device orientations.

15
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,820
So that is one important thing you can do here,

16
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,440
there are other things which will become more useful once we later

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,190
also work with maps and so on. Here if you click on these three dots, you have even more options of configuring

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,310
and fine tuning this. On the iOS simulator,

19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:51,070
you can also rotate the device, you have all your options up here in the toolbar or in this top control

20
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,910
bar here.

21
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,760
There under hardware, you can also rotate the device or you use one of these shortcuts here and there

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,060
for example, you can also control the soft keyboard and enable that, disable that, so that you can either

23
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,650
use your real keyboard on your MacBook or on your MacOS device

24
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:15,010
once we have some text inputs here or that you use the soft keyboard on the screen. Simply play around

25
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,320
with these settings to get a feeling for what you can do there and how you can control these emulators

26
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,340
for testing the app in the way you want to test it.
