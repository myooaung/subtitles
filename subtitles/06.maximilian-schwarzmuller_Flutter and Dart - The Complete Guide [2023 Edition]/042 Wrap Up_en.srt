1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,360
So in this module, we built our first little application.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,670
Now as I said, of course we can certainly build more beautiful applications

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,180
and that is something we will of course do throughout this course.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,640
No worries, we'll dive a lot into how you can style and layout your apps, how you can change colors, how

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,290
you can adjust all these widgets to your needs and preferences.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,260
What we did in this module though is we covered a lot of important things,

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,830
we covered what widgets are, that there are stateful and stateless widgets, that you typically use

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,890
more stateless than stateful widgets and that they are both important and how they split work.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,050
You learned how to work with built-in widgets and where to find them in the official widget catalog,

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,830
that you can also build your own widgets that actually compose more complex user interface building

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:59,140
blocks from these Flutter primitives you get, from these core basic widgets Flutter gives you. You

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,300
learned how to manage some data, how to pass it around as arguments to constructors and you also learned

13
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,260
a lot about Dart and some of its core fundamentals.

14
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,600
If you haven't done it already,

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,630
definitely dive into the attached resources and text lectures which you'll also find in this module,

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,900
also in the attachments to the last lecture of this module, especially also to compare code because

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,650
this will then allow you to dive deeper into certain things you struggled with or which might not be

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:37,760
entirely clear yet. With all these resources, you should have a first understanding of what Flutter is,

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,430
how it works and how you work with it and how you build widgets.

20
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,760
Now we'll of course continue doing that throughout the course and dive even deeper into other features and other

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,480
things you can do with Dart and Flutter.

22
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,390
So let's move on.
