00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,550
So we added a couple of nice HTTP related features to this application,

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,770
now let's see what's missing.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,030
For example on the shop, when I switch the favorite status here,

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,520
currently that's not saved,

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,180
if I reload the page, this is simply gone because we're not saving this on the server and of course we're

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,410
also not saving any orders. When I place something in a cart and I order this,

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:30,490
obviously it gets added to that orders screen here for all the orders which I do add but the orders

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,930
thereafter are lost if the app restarts because we're not saving the orders on a server. So that would

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,690
be something I want to do, save the orders and of course fetch the orders from a server and also save changes

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,260
in the favorite status to the server.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,360
Now definitely feel free to try to do this on your own.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,700
I will implement that favorite thing with optimistic updating, where you immediately update this here

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,860
and you only roll it back if it failed,

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,350
that's just a little hint and for the orders you can just store and fetch them as we basically did it

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,920
also with product, so add an order, fetch orders, the patterns there should be similar to how we did that for

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,480
adding products.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,190
One note about adding orders, here

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,710
you might want to go to the cart and make sure that the order now button is disabled

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,900
if we can't place an order and that whilst we are placing that order,

20
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,690
so whilst the HTTP request is on its way,

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,010
you maybe show some loading spinner here inside of the disabled button then because the button should

22
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,180
also be disabled whilst the request is on its way,

23
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,280
so that you give the user some feedback on when the button may be used and when the progress is in transit.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,250
These are the things I'll implement in the next lectures,

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,450
here's your chance to first try it on your own and then do it together with me of course.
