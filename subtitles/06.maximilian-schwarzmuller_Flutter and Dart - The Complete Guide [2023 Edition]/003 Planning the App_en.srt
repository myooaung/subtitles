1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,620
Now which application will we build in this module?

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,070
We'll build an expense planner

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,810
and that means that users should be able to add their expenses, like what you bought yesterday,

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:25,610
bottle of milk, maybe some new shoes. You can add them and we keep track of those expenses in a list and

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,780
then we also show a little chart

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,250
that basically sums up what we spend over the last week.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,870
So our application will look something like this and now come my awesome drawing skills.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,720
This is our iPhone or our Android phone

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:50,060
and in there, in this application here, we'll therefore have a couple of things. We'll have our little chart

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,830
up there which we'll build which will basically have little bars that indicate how much we spend on each

11
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,630
day over the last week.

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,770
Below the chart, I want to have a list of the transactions which we registered and for each transaction,

13
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:14,670
we kind of save the price let's say, so what we spend and then a little title here, something like that.

14
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,130
I also want to make sure that we can of course add new items here

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,760
and for that, we'll have a little plus button here in the app bar and I also want to have a so-called

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,210
floating action button here at the bottom, which also has a plus and both buttons, because this of course

17
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,240
still is also a course where I want to show you something, will trigger in the end not a new page

18
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,920
but a new mode on the existing page.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,780
So we're still on the same page where we have that chart and so on

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,630
but once we press one of these plus buttons, a little bottom sheet should slide in,

21
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,040
so this is a little sheet coming in from the bottom overlaying the rest of this application,

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,050
so behind that would be our list of transactions here

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:10,039
and in that bottom sheet, we'll have some inputs for the title and for the price and also a date picker

24
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:17,540
so that we can pick a date and then of course, a button to confirm this.

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:25,190
Now I can certainly draw nicer than that or maybe I can't but we can certainly build this app and we'll

26
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,590
build this app with some of the widgets Flutter gives us, with more than just the basic widgets we

27
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,460
use thus far and we'll then also use the various theming and styling features Flutter gives us to

28
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,480
make this application look good.

29
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,180
With that, let's get started.
