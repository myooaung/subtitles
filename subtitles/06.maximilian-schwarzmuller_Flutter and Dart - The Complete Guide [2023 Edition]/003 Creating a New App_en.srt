1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,140
Now to build an app.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,689
I have a brand new Flutter app here.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,590
A basic app as it comes created by Flutter Create.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,650
And you find this snapshot, this main dart and this pops backdoored yaml file attached in case you

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,810
want to start with the exact same app.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,590
And I also already launched it here on an Android emulator.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,130
And as you can see, this is really our standard starting app here.

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,050
So now let's turn it into the app we actually want.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,330
And for that, of course, I'm going to utilize all that knowledge we gathered throughout that course,

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:42,200
though the app we build will not be too fancy because I rather want to focus on those Firebase features

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,520
and how to utilize those features in a Flutter app in this module.

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,180
Nonetheless, we'll need a bunch of different elements here, to be precise, will at least need to

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,320
screens because we'll definitely have those two screens, login and authentication screen and the chat

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,920
screen.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,519
And of course we'll also need a couple of widgets.

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,600
Now for that I'll add a screens folder where we can add those screens and a widgets folder which will

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,700
hold any other widgets which are not standalone screens in the screens folder.

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:24,200
I'll add my auth underscore screen start file which will hold the authentication screen and I'll also

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,850
add the chat screen which you guessed it will hold the chat.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,060
And for widgets, we'll add them as we go and as we need them.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,010
Now, I will actually start with a basic chat screen here.

22
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:45,340
We will actually need authentication before we can chat, but I want to show you how Firebase works,

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,400
and that is best shown with the database feature.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,160
And therefore we'll start with the chat and we'll turn it into a real chat with users later.

25
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:02,950
So on the chat screen, let's create a new stateless widget actually, which will name chat screen and

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,530
make sure that in this file you import material dart from the flutter package.

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,760
And here I will not just return such a container, but I actually want to return a list view of chat

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,750
messages.

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,820
Now for that, I'll use that builder mode here to have that item builder and you'll learn about that

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,370
in the course.

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,570
The item builder here takes a function, essentially, which gets the context and the index of the item

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,740
that is being built.

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,560
And then here in this arrow function, for example, we return the item, the widget that should be

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,320
built for every item we have in the list view.

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,760
So here we could build a simple, let's say, container where we have some padding with edge insets,

36
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:59,010
all of eight to have a padding of eight in all directions, and then a child, which is simply some

37
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,700
text.

38
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,860
This works like that.

39
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,490
Now the list view builder also needs the item count so that we know how many items should be created.

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,490
And I'm just going to build ten items here soon.

41
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,140
We'll build this dynamically.

42
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,260
Now the chat screen, of course, should be visible.

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,790
So let's go back to the main dart file and here I'll rename this title to flutter chat and get rid of

44
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,450
that comment.

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,360
Here, get rid of this comment here.

46
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,300
And here under home, I will not render my home page here.

47
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,510
Instead, I'll delete all that code down there.

48
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,120
And instead I will just render my chart screen here.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,510
So make sure you add that import here to the chat screen dart file from your own package.

50
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,540
This import is also fine to use from the screen's folder and the chat screen dart file.

51
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,390
And with that, we have our chat screen being rendered here.

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,030
Now, if we save everything and you have a running emulator and you run your application on that emulator,

53
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,460
you should see this works here.

54
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,660
Now, this looks ugly because we're missing a scaffold.

55
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,450
So let's go back to the chat screen and we can refactor this to wrap the list view with the widget and

56
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,550
wrap it with a scaffold here.

57
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,320
Now, the scaffold does not have a child, but a body instead.

58
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,420
And if we do just that and we save this, this already looks a bit nicer.

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,100
Now, that's, of course, just some dummy static data.

60
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,860
So therefore, let's now explore Firebase and see how that works.
