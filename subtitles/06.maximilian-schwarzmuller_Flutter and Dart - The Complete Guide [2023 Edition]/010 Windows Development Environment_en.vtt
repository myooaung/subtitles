00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.033
- So in the previous lecture,

2
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.866
we installed Flutter and Android Studio

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:10.533
so that we can build
Android apps with Flutter.

4
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.133
Now in this lecture, we'll
create a Flutter project

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.300
and see how we can then edit the code

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.566
and how we can run this Flutter app

7
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.433
that will be in that
project, on our emulator.

8
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.600
And for this, we go back
to this command prompt.

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.766
In there, we have this Flutter command,

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.400
which we can now use,
and we can also use it

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.533
to create new projects.

12
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.133
Now for this, you first of all,

13
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.633
should navigate inside
of this command prompt

14
00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:42.433
into the folder where you
wanna create your project.

15
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.966
And you can use the CD command for that,

16
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.066
which stands for change directory.

17
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.066
And here you could, for example,

18
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.666
CD into a folder named development,

19
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.266
if you have such a folder.

20
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:58.333
I did create that folder
before, in my user folder.

21
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.633
And then in that development folder,

22
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:04.066
you can CD into sub folders.

23
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.700
Now I don't have any sub folders yet,

24
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.266
so what I'll quickly do is in Explorer,

25
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.700
I'll go into that folder,
create a new folder there,

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.433
which I'll name projects.

27
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:16.966
Name is up to you.

28
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.000
And then here, back in the command prompt,

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.133
I can navigate into this
projects folder by typing CD proj

30
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.733
and then I hit tab for auto completion.

31
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.700
And now I'm in that path
where I wanna create

32
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.833
my new Flutter folder, and you should use

33
00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:35.266
some global path like this.

34
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.700
Now, once you have that folder,

35
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.200
you can use the flutter command again,

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.200
but now we'll run flutter
create to create a new project.

37
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.833
And then when you use that command,

38
00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:49.533
which is exposed by Flutter,

39
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.833
you need to give your project a name.

40
00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:54.500
And I'll name it first_app here.

41
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.866
You should use a name that
is something like this

42
00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:01.866
that does not contain any wide
space, no dashes, no dots,

43
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.133
instead under scores if
you have multiple words

44
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.400
which you wanna separate.

45
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.266
And then you can hit enter,
and this will now create

46
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.233
a brand new Flutter project in there,

47
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.700
hence in the Explorer
and the projects folder,

48
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.933
I now have this first_app folder,

49
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:23.866
and now we want to open that
with some tool that allows us

50
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.933
to view and edit the code.

51
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.466
We could use Android Studio for that,

52
00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.700
but since it's a bit heavy
and a bit slow in my opinion,

53
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.066
I will use a different tool
which has great Flutter support,

54
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:39.066
and that's Visual Studio Code.

55
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.733
You can search for VS Code

56
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:45.166
to find code.visualstudio.com,

57
00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.800
and VS Code is a free IDE,

58
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.533
a free code editor provided by Microsoft,

59
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.766
which you can download
for all operating systems,

60
00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:59.000
which allows you to edit
code, not just Flutter code,

61
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.300
but a lot of other programming
languages and frameworks

62
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.066
as well, but it does have
great Flutter support as well.

63
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.766
So here I'll just
download it, and then once

64
00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:13.866
that download finished I'll
execute this installer,

65
00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:15.500
which it gives me,

66
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.600
accept the agreement,
use the default location,

67
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.800
keep all the other defaults,

68
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.366
and make sure it's added to your path.

69
00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:26.966
This here is in German,
but it basically says

70
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:29.400
that it's added to the path variable.

71
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.533
So I'll keep that and then install it.

72
00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:36.700
And now this will install
this Visual Studio Code tool

73
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.066
on our system, which we
can use for editing code.

74
00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:43.966
So let's wait for this to finish,

75
00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:46.566
and then we can also start it right away.

76
00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:51.233
And if you start it, you
see something like this,

77
00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:55.266
a little starting screen where
you can also choose a theme,

78
00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:57.266
and I'll go with the dark theme.

79
00:03:57.266 --> 00:04:02.266
You can also edit this if
you go to file, preferences,

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.700
and then color theme, here
you can also switch the theme,

81
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.900
and I'll use dark plus.

82
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.300
Close this, and then
before we open a project,

83
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.132
we'll also install a couple of extensions

84
00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:20.399
because a great feature of
Visual Studio Code is that

85
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.300
it has built in extensions support,

86
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.000
and extensions are
basically just plug-ins,

87
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.833
which you can install
into Visual Studio Code.

88
00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:34.233
So for that, we can go to view, extensions

89
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:36.800
or use this shortcut here

90
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.933
or click on extensions here on the left.

91
00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.166
And then there, there are
a couple of extensions

92
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:43.500
you should install.

93
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.300
Most importantly, you want
to search for Flutter here

94
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.166
and install this Flutter extension.

95
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:54.633
This helps you with writing
Flutter code and provides

96
00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:58.600
great support whilst you
are writing Flutter code.

97
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.800
So inside of this editor,

98
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.966
you'll then get great support for Flutter.

99
00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:06.900
This also installed a Dart
extension automatically,

100
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.266
which will help with Dart code in general,

101
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:12.566
and Flutter user start, as you learned.

102
00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:16.700
And last but not least, I'll
search for Material Icon,

103
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.800
which is totally optional,
but which changes

104
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.500
the look of the file icons,
and I like that look.

105
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.433
I'm using it throughout this
course, and if you want it too,

106
00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:27.933
you can install this
Material Icon Theme here

107
00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:31.400
to get that icon look,
and then in this dropdown

108
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.000
which opens, I'll select
Material Icon Theme

109
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.966
to set my icon look to it.

110
00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:37.566
Click activate here as well.

111
00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:42.233
Okay, so now I got all
these things installed.

112
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:45.433
Now we can open our newly
created Flutter project

113
00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:50.033
with Visual Studio Code, and
for that here under file,

114
00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:53.266
I'll choose open folder and then go into

115
00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.333
the development folder, projects,

116
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.500
and select this first_app folder,

117
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.866
the entire folder and choose that folder.

118
00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:04.033
And then here, I'm prompted
whether I want to trust

119
00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:06.166
this folder, and I'll choose yes here.

120
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.466
I'll also accept the
recommended VS Code settings

121
00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:13.566
for Dart and Flutter and
click on yes here as well.

122
00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:18.800
Now here, we got this Flutter project

123
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.533
opened up in Visual Studio Code.

124
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.100
Now the starting project
you get and the exact files

125
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.100
and folders you have in
there could vary over time,

126
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.433
and therefore, to ensure that
we're all on the same page,

127
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.000
attached you'll find my popspec.yaml file,

128
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.666
so this file here, and my
main.dart file in the lib folder,

129
00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:44.266
and you should replace your
content in the lib folder

130
00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:48.366
with my main.dart file so
if you have more folders

131
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.533
and files in the lib folder,
delete them all and use

132
00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:54.466
my attached main.dart
file and drag it into

133
00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:57.100
this lib folder and replace

134
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.300
your pubspec.yaml file with mine.

135
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.200
With that, we simply ensure that you have

136
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.000
exactly the same starting
configuration and project as I do

137
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.433
and you get the same output as I do.

138
00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:13.100
And with that, we got this
set up and we can now run

139
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.300
this project here, and
of course also edit it.

140
00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:20.233
Now I'll walk through the
different folders and files

141
00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:22.833
and what we have here in
the next course section,

142
00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:25.566
so I'll ignore that for now,
and instead, I wanna show you

143
00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:28.233
how you can run such a Flutter project

144
00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:32.000
as an Android app here
on this Android emulator

145
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.433
which we have up and running.

146
00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:37.566
And this can be done by
going to terminal here

147
00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:42.033
and clicking on new terminal
in the VS Code menu here.

148
00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:46.266
And this is your system command prompt,

149
00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.833
just integrated into VS Code.

150
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:53.000
The great thing about that is
that we can run commands in it

151
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200
without leaving our project here

152
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.466
and without leaving our
code, so we can have

153
00:07:57.466 --> 00:07:59.400
multiple things on the same screen.

154
00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:04.600
And in here, what you can now
do to run your application

155
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.200
on this emulator is you
can run flutter run,

156
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.933
just make sure that this
emulator is up and running.

157
00:08:11.933 --> 00:08:15.100
And then flutter run is
a command that will take

158
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.266
your Flutter code, convert it
to machine code for Android

159
00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.800
in this case, since we
have an Android emulator

160
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.400
up and running, and run that
Android app on that emulator.

161
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.933
And later in the course,
you will also learn how to

162
00:08:28.933 --> 00:08:31.300
run it on real devices and how to

163
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.666
build for different platforms.

164
00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:37.533
Very important, you need to
run it inside of your project.

165
00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.366
That's why I'm using this
integrated terminal because this

166
00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:45.766
integrated terminal will
automatically be navigated into

167
00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:48.533
this Flutter project so that this command

168
00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:51.200
is executed from inside that project.

169
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.066
And if you now hit enter,

170
00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:57.233
this will do what I just explained.

171
00:08:57.233 --> 00:09:01.400
It will build your Flutter
project as an Android app

172
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.700
and then run it on that Android emulator.

173
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.033
Now in case this app is not started on your Android

174
00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:14.133
emulator,
but instead built as a web app, for example,

175
00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:18.100
you want to make sure that in Visual Studio Code

176
00:09:18.366 --> 00:09:22.033
you can view that status bar at the bottom

177
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.666
because in that status bar you can select the

178
00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:29.500
device on which this Flutter app will be executed.

179
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.333
So for which this Flutter app will be built.

180
00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:35.533
And here you should make sure that you select

181
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.500
one of
these emulators if you have one up and running.

182
00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:44.200
Alternatively, you start a new emulator
here and then you pick it as the target device.

183
00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:49.066
You don't want
to pick Chrome, Edge, Windows or anything like that.

184
00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:54.333
Instead, choose
your Android device, your Android emulator here.

185
00:09:56.233 --> 00:09:58.433
Now the first time you execute this,

186
00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:02.466
this can take a bit longer,
so definitely give this

187
00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:06.466
some time, but eventually
it should be done,

188
00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:09.800
and then start this Flutter
app as an Android app,

189
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.800
as a native Android app
on this Android simulator.

190
00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.233
So let's wait for that to finish,

191
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.200
and by the way, this will be
quite slow and take some time

192
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.066
the first time you do this.

193
00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:28.066
Subsequent changes and
restarts will be faster,

194
00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:29.666
so no worries about that.

195
00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:33.800
And now here for me
it's crashing, actually.

196
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.000
It's crashing with this error message

197
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that Kotlin could not find
the required JDK tools.

198
00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:43.133
If you're not getting this, perfect.

199
00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:46.066
If you are getting it, what you have to do

200
00:10:46.066 --> 00:10:50.900
is Google for, JDK 8, and
you should find this page

201
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.900
on oracle.com and then there,
pick the download version

202
00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:57.600
for your system.

203
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.533
In my case, Windows.

204
00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.633
Now, here we can then download this,

205
00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:05.466
and unfortunately we have
to create an account here.

206
00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:07.333
It's free, but we have to do that.

207
00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:11.600
And once you did create that
account and then sign in

208
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.200
on this page, the download
will start, of this JDK tool,

209
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.133
which we now need to fix this
error which we got during

210
00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:22.300
building this Android
app with Flutter here.

211
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.466
So let's wait for this download to finish,

212
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.100
and then we can simply walk
through this installer,

213
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.100
keep all the defaults here,

214
00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:38.833
and install this Java development kit,

215
00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:41.066
which Android needs under the hood.

216
00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:44.033
And you might not need that
because in some installations,

217
00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:46.333
this is set up correctly
right from the start.

218
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.866
For me here it wasn't.

219
00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:51.333
I'll also confirm the defaults here

220
00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:54.700
and install Java itself and make sure that

221
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.200
all these tools are installed here.

222
00:11:58.533 --> 00:12:01.366
And once this was installed successfully,

223
00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:07.266
you can go back and you
can run flutter run again,

224
00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:10.966
and now this time, it should succeed here

225
00:12:10.966 --> 00:12:13.900
and it should build this application.

226
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.766
And it now also sends
this application queue,

227
00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:21.200
this Android emulator, which
is up and running here.

228
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.566
And here, you can now play
around with this starting app,

229
00:12:24.566 --> 00:12:27.033
which you get if you
use my attached files,

230
00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:29.833
the main.dart file and
the pubspec.yaml file

231
00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.933
as instructed earlier.

232
00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:36.100
And this is now our Flutter
project, our Flatter app,

233
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.566
running as a native Android
app on this Android simulator.

234
00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:44.066
And now that this is up and running

235
00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:46.966
with that flutter run
process, which is a process

236
00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:51.066
that is still running, we
can actually now go into

237
00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:54.666
one of our code files here
and then search that line

238
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:58.833
where counter plus plus
is executed, line 58,

239
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.500
and change that a little bit.

240
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.333
Now, by the way, I will
explain all that code

241
00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:09.033
and how Dart and Flutter work
throughout this entire course.

242
00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:11.500
For the moment, we'll just
make a quick change here

243
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.866
and change line 58 to say

244
00:13:13.866 --> 00:13:17.833
underscore counter equals
underscore counter plus two.

245
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:23.233
If you then save this file
by pressing control, S

246
00:13:23.233 --> 00:13:25.433
so that you don't have this bullet next to

247
00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:29.100
the file name anymore,
then you don't have to run

248
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.066
flutter run again to see this
change in the running app,

249
00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:38.166
but instead with this ongoing
process that was started

250
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:42.400
by executing flutter
run, we can now press R

251
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.966
to perform a so-called hot
reload, which basically means

252
00:13:46.966 --> 00:13:51.700
that our updated code is
injected into this running app,

253
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.933
which is a quick way of seeing changes

254
00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.533
without restarting everything.

255
00:13:56.533 --> 00:13:58.666
So therefore now, if I press R,

256
00:13:58.666 --> 00:14:00.633
this hot reload is performed,

257
00:14:00.633 --> 00:14:02.533
and now if I click the plus here,

258
00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:06.333
this counter changes by two
instead of one as before

259
00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:08.066
because of this code change,

260
00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:11.133
which is reflected by this hot reload.

261
00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:15.566
Alternatively, you can also
perform a so-called hot restart

262
00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:19.766
by pressing shift, R, which
will then also still be quicker

263
00:14:19.766 --> 00:14:23.200
than running flutter run
again, but which will restart

264
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.900
that app that's running on the emulator,

265
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.633
which is why now the
counter is reset to zero.

266
00:14:29.633 --> 00:14:33.133
And that's how we could
run our application here.

267
00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:36.266
Now, I am saying could
because whilst this works,

268
00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:39.266
it can be a bit annoying
that we have to press R

269
00:14:39.266 --> 00:14:41.366
or shift, R all the time.

270
00:14:42.266 --> 00:14:45.833
Therefore, I'll quit this
running flatter run process

271
00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:49.266
by pressing control, C
here in this terminal

272
00:14:49.266 --> 00:14:53.033
and confirming it with Y,
and I'll close this terminal

273
00:14:54.066 --> 00:14:57.666
because since we installed
that Flutter extension earlier,

274
00:14:57.666 --> 00:15:01.366
we also have a different
way of running our projects,

275
00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:04.966
our Flutter projects as apps on emulators,

276
00:15:04.966 --> 00:15:08.333
and that will be the way I
use throughout this course.

277
00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:12.866
We can go to run and then
choose run without debugging.

278
00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:17.200
Later in the course, we will
also dive into debugging,

279
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.400
but for now, let's run
it without debugging.

280
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.366
And this now also runs
flutter run under the hood,

281
00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:26.366
but we don't see it here.

282
00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.666
We don't actively have to run this.

283
00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:31.500
We still get a terminal
window here, but that's now

284
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.733
actually just a little output window,

285
00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:38.266
which shows info messages
and possible warnings to us,

286
00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:40.800
and then we get prompted
whether we want to open

287
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.366
the Dart dev tools.

288
00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:44.166
I'll not do that here.

289
00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:47.766
We will see them later, so
I'll choose not now for now,

290
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.433
and again, we'll have our
app here on this emulator,

291
00:15:53.866 --> 00:15:56.900
but now we have this
control panel up here,

292
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.200
where we also could perform a hot reload

293
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.700
or a hot restart by
clicking on these buttons

294
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.233
or using the shortcuts which you see here.

295
00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:09.400
And we can always stop
this running process

296
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.433
by pressing this stop button,

297
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.533
but the great thing is that if
you start your app like this,

298
00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:18.800
you don't even have to
use the hot reload button.

299
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.933
If I change my code, for
example, to say plus three,

300
00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:26.166
and I then save this, it
will automatically perform

301
00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:29.900
this hot reload, so it
detects file changes.

302
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.166
So whenever we save a changed file,

303
00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:36.033
and will automatically
update the running app here.

304
00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:38.200
And that's of course even more convenient

305
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.666
than manually triggering those updates

306
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.600
with R or shift, R,

307
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.766
and therefore, that's
how I will run my apps.

308
00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:48.066
And if you are done for today,

309
00:16:48.066 --> 00:16:50.766
you can always stop this process,

310
00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:53.933
and then the app is shut
down on the emulator,

311
00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:55.433
and if you want to work on it again,

312
00:16:55.433 --> 00:16:57.766
you just start this again.

313
00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.800
And that's what we'll do
throughout the course,

314
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.300
and of course, in the course,
I will then also explain

315
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.665
all that code and how
Flutter and Dart work.

316
00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:08.532
Now, feel free to also tweak

317
00:17:08.532 --> 00:17:10.633
the appearance of Visual Studio Code

318
00:17:10.633 --> 00:17:12.833
here with the appearance menu.

319
00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:17.500
You can show and hide the
sidebars and various other areas

320
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.300
so that you like your editor.

321
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.500
So make sure you tweak it like that,

322
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.165
and then therefore, we are
now done and we can continue.

323
00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:27.933
Now, I will say that throughout
the rest of the course,

324
00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:31.366
I am working on Mac,
but the code you write

325
00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:34.600
is exactly the same, so it
won't make a difference for you,

326
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.900
and I also will be using
the Android emulator

327
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.166
throughout the course so
that's exactly the same

328
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:42.600
for you also if you use Windows.

329
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.766
So just because I'm using
Mac in the next lectures,

330
00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:48.400
and in this entire course,
does not mean that you need

331
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.533
to change anything or that
you can't follow along.

332
00:17:51.533 --> 00:17:53.766
You can follow along just fine

333
00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:55.633
because the code will be the same.
