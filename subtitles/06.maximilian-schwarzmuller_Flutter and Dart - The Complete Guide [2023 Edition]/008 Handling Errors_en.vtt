00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.760
Now before I actually test this on a real device though, let me show you a little bug which we have.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.200
If I open a camera and I go back without taking a picture, which of course is something the user could

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.490
do because the button was pressed accidentally or whatever,

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.440
then at the moment we're getting an error here and

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.440
we're getting this error because in the image input, I'm of course taking that image and then I try to

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.470
save it to my local storage.

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.560
The problem is this here, pick image will return a file but it might also return null if the user doesn't

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.340
take a picture,

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.070
so if the camera gets opened but then no image is returned and therefore of course, we should handle

10
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.370
that case.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.630
So in here, I'll check if image file is equal to null and if it is, I'll simply return here and I'll not

12
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.270
continue with the other code in there because if we have no image, then of course we can't save it,

13
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330
we can't show it as a preview.

14
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.090
So with that change in place, let's actually try this again,

15
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.150
click on take picture and then click on back here instead of the camera so that we don't take a picture

16
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.090
and now you see here, we got a normal system log but I got no error now and that is a change we

17
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.690
need to make.

18
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.030
Now let's also test this on real devices.
