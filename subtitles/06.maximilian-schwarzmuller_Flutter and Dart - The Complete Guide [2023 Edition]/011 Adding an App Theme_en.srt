1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,350
We have the basic auth form, but I don't want to use the default blue color.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,840
I also don't want to use the default button theme.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,900
Instead, I want to set my own themes.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:19,250
And for this in the main dart file here in the theme data which is configured, we can change the colors

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,160
and also some other styles we want to set as a default.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,480
For example, the primary swatch here, I don't want to use colors blue here, but colors pink.

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,770
Yeah, I like that pink color here.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,710
In addition, I want to set a background color, a default background color of that same pink.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,850
I also want to set an accent color and that will be this Deep Purple, which I think mixes nicely with

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,630
that pink.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:53,190
I also want to let Flutter know that this purple color is a very dark color and that any contrast in

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,690
color on this purple background should therefore be a bright color.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,570
And we can do this by setting the x and color brightness to brightness dot dark.

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,050
We don't need to do this on the primary swatch there.

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,040
Flutter should derive this automatically, but we should do this here.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,330
To avoid that we end up with black text on purple, for example.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,580
And I also want to set up a specific button theme which every button will get by default.

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,600
And to do this, I basically want to inherit from the default button theme and then just overwrite some

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,500
parts.

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,800
And for that, we can use the button theme constructor here and use the Auth constructor.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,400
So not the default constructor, but this named constructor and pass in the regular context and then

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,020
call copy width.

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,470
And this allows you to then override some of the keys and use the other default values.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,040
For example, I will set the button color to colors pink so that every button by default has that pink

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,090
main color.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
I'll set the text theme to button text theme dot primary.

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,560
This should make sure that we have the right contrast color, and I'll also change the default shape

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,530
of buttons.

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,990
For this, we can set the shape configuration and then set this to rounded rectangle border.

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,480
Use this constructor here and cue rounded rectangle border.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,080
We can pass a border radius argument and there we can set the default border radius every button should

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:38,580
have with the border radius constructor to be precise with the circular named constructor this provides

33
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,620
and then set this to 20 maybe.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,860
And if we do that and save that, you see now I have a rounded button here by default and I have this

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,560
pink background color which looks quite nice.

36
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,350
Now this button still has a blue text and we can change this by going to the off form.

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,620
And then on this flat button I'll change the text color to theme of context.

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,890
Primary color.

39
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,580
And this doesn't look too bad.

40
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:13,960
Now it would be nice to also have a working off forum which collects the user inputs, which validates

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,390
the user inputs, and where we also can switch between log in and sign up mode.

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,760
Now you can try this on your own because thus far that's nothing we haven't learned.

43
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,240
Of course, you shouldn't yet also use the Firebase SDK to send this to a server, but collecting and

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,600
validating the input that is something you definitely are able to do.

45
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,180
Will do it together in the next lecture.
