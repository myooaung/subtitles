1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,566
This was a pretty long module,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,233
I now want to wrap it up or bring it to an end by making this quiz a bit more realistic and showing

3
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:16,065
different results based on which answers we chose.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,633
Now of course, you could now make this extremely complex,

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,300
I will make it relatively simple though.

6
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:29,433
What I want to do is I want to turn each answer here also into a map, by wrapping it with curly braces

7
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:34,233
and then we'll of course have our text or answer text or whatever you want to name it

8
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:40,633
and now that's important, you think I want to assign a score to this answer because we have kind of a

9
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:47,300
personality quiz here, so we can calculate an overall score of the personality of the person who takes

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,633
our quiz.

11
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,700
Now let's say and that's of course just my logic here,

12
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:56,733
the higher the score, the more strange or negative a person is and

13
00:00:56,766 --> 00:01:01,933
therefore if you for example select black as your favorite color, I'll give you a score of 10,

14
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:10,800
on the other hand here for red where then red is our text,

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,133
we might go with a score of let's say 6 or 5 because red is more positive than black in my world at

16
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:24,400
least. Now green is even more positive because green is the color of hope

17
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:30,233
and of course, feel free to assign your own scores to fit your own personal judgment of these colors

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,733
but I'll gave green a color of three

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,100
and white is of course the color of innocence,

20
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:44,933
so here for white, I'll actually give that a score of let's say 1.

21
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,500
So with that, these are my answers,

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,400
they're now all maps, not just text, they've got a text key but then they also got scores.

23
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:58,766
Now of course, we can do the same here for our animals and I will now fast forward here,

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,933
of course feel free to assign your own scores or take the ones you find attached, attached you basically

25
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,933
find that questions list

26
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:14,866
now with all my finished scores assigned and we can then proceed with that. So with the finished

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,200
list here,

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,900
now of course when I pass down my questions here into the quiz, inside of the quiz widget where I build

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,266
these answer widgets, the answer I'm forwarding here is no longer just a string, that is incorrect instead

30
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,466
each answer I'm looking at is of course itself

31
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:43,433
now a map, so we should change this, a map where we have a string key and then objects, various values

32
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:52,966
because we have in our answers, we have both text and we have numbers. So therefore here when I map, answer

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,600
now is also a map with various values and therefore here I'm of course interested in my text, in the

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:11,166
answer text which I know will be a string but I will also need the score to calculate a total score

35
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,366
of course.

36
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:16,833
Now before we explore this "total score" though, you might be getting an error here.

37
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,100
and maybe also regarding this "questionText"

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,366
though you would've gotten this earlier already

39
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,233
and you can solve these errors by simply adding

40
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,933
"as String" thereafter - to make it very clear to Dart

41
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:33,366
which kind of data it can expect from accessing that key.

42
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:39,100
If you need "as String" or not depends on the Dart version you're using -

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,133
- it's not directly related to Flutter but instead depends on Dart.

44
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,600
In "pubspec.yaml"

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,533
If you have this "environment: sdk: " set to

46
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,100
>= 2.12.0 (i.e. 2.12 or higher)

47
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,700
then you need to add "as String".

48
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,266
I don't recommend setting this though

49
00:03:57,266 --> 00:04:00,200
instead, to follow along smoothly.

50
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,400
and still learn everything about Flutter without issues,

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,166
you should set this to >=2.11.0.

52
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,966
In that case, you can omit "as String"

53
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:15,566
and you can follow along with the code shown in the course just fine.

54
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,966
But if you do have ">= 2.12.0", even though it's not recommended,

55
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,933
you will need to add "as String".

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,200
But now let's make sure we also calculate such a totalScore.

57
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:33,000
And for that here to answerQuestion,

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,600
so to that function which we have in the main.dart file, this _answerQuestion function here,

59
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,766
we actually need to get the score of the answer which was chosen.

60
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:50,233
So I expect a score here as an argument and this should be an integer, to calculate a total score.

61
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:57,866
Hence we should also add a total score, _totalScore here, a total score property in our overall

62
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:06,500
class and then here in answerQuestion, I want to increase or add to the total score the score that we

63
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,266
chose.

64
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,600
So total score should be equal to total score plus score By the way

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,600
if you have a setup like this, there also is a shortcut in Dart, instead of using equal old value plus

66
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,300
some new value,

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,133
you can also have plus equal and this will add this value to the old value before it then saves it back

68
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
into that variable.

69
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,266
So we add our score to the total score

70
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:38,266
now in answerQuestion but now we have to make sure that in the quiz.dart file here where we forward

71
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:46,133
answerQuestion to an answer, we actually make sure that we call answer questions with the chosen score

72
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:52,166
and at the moment where we only point a reference, a pointer at that function,

73
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,466
we're not doing that because with just a pointer,

74
00:05:54,466 --> 00:06:00,866
we're not saying anything about the arguments that this function takes when it is called and by default,

75
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:06,966
Flutter will call it without any arguments because we must not forget that our function here is bound

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,533
to onPressed and onPressed takes a function without arguments.

77
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,200
So what do we do? In quiz.dart where I build my answer widgets, where I forward that pointer at answer

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,800
question, instead of forwarding this, I can forward an anonymous function and here I use this one line

79
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:30,400
arrow function syntax which I also showed you earlier.

80
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,766
Now by doing this, I create a function on the fly and to the answer widget, I automatically only pass

81
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,300
the address to that function.

82
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:43,966
So that function is created on the fly, stored in memory and instead of storing it in a variable which

83
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:48,466
then holds the address which I could use here, I automatically get back the address,

84
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:52,566
so I do get the address here and I forward that address to answer.

85
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,700
Now the thing is therefore my answer widget still gets a function which takes no arguments right,

86
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,266
that is an empty list and that then does something.

87
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:09,766
Now here however on the right side of the arrow here, I'm in the function body of that anonymous function.

88
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:16,166
So here, I no longer want to just use the address, here I instead want to call answerQuestion

89
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,033
Why?

90
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:23,500
Because this is now not executed when Dart parses this, there it will only create this anonymous function

91
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,800
and store it in memory

92
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:31,333
but this is now executed when onPressed is triggered, right because it's an anonymous function where

93
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:36,433
I forward the address to answer, the address is then bound to the button here,

94
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:43,166
so when a button is pressed, this address is used to then execute this anonymous function. So this function

95
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,300
body here is only triggered when the button is pressed.

96
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,933
Therefore when it is pressed, I do want to call answerQuestion

97
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:58,200
and now since I call it here, I do have access to my answer map here, to my answer object and therefore

98
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,366
also to the score because every answer through which I'm looping here or through which I'm going here, every

99
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:12,833
answer is just a map with a text and a score and now I can access that score here. So I can now forward

100
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,766
answer score here to answerQuestion and I know that this will be an integer and therefore, answer

101
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,166
question here will receive my integer score,

102
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,033
here it is.

103
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,600
I hope this flow is clear,

104
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:33,566
it's really just about passing function references around and here we're creating such a function and

105
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:40,799
therefore also such a function reference on the fly. It only gets executed when the button is pressed though,

106
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:48,566
so when it is pressed I of course want to execute this function in here. So with that, I can forward the score

107
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:49,966
to my answer

108
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:54,766
question function here in main and I do increment the total score now.

109
00:08:54,966 --> 00:09:02,033
I now want to forward that total score to the result widget so that I can show different results there.
