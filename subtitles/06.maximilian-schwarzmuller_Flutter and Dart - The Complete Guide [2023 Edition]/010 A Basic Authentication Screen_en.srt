1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:10,220
So now that we saw the real time functionality of Firebase in Action, and now that we saw how we can

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:18,230
connect our Flutter app with help of the Firebase SDK to Firebase, the service, which just make this

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,160
clear again is totally decoupled from Flutter.

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,120
It works with web apps, with native Android apps, it works with a bunch of other apps as well.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,440
But we can also use it with Flutter through that SDK.

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,940
So now that we made this to work, let's take a step back.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,890
We don't need to chat screen right now.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,800
We need to off screen instead because we want to build an application where users have to authenticate

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,390
before they can chat.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,980
So let's go to the off screen dart file and let's create a new widget in there.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,160
And that should be a state full widget now.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,770
So make sure you create that stateful widget class here and the state class that belongs to it.

13
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,489
And here I'm using the shortcut where I can type stuff in visual pseudocode and then I get this suggestion

14
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:12,230
and by clicking tab or by hitting tab, this is generated and here I'll name this off screen and you

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,170
see it enters this in all the relevant places.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:22,190
And I will also import material, material dot dart from the flutter package.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,500
And now here I want to render my well guess what my off screen.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,360
For that.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,010
Here.

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,830
Instead of rendering a container, I'll render a scaffold because I want to have a nice background and

21
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,490
so on.

22
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:45,590
And I will set the background color of this page, not to the default to this grayish white look, but

23
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,880
instead I want to use my primary color here and with theme of context, primary color, we get access

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,310
to that as you learn from the course.

25
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,420
Now for the body of the scaffold here.

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,540
Of course I want to display some form.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:11,340
So in the end, a form where the user can enter the email, the password and the username, and later

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,020
also pick an image.

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,280
That's the goal here.

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,000
For that form, I'll use the center widget to have a well centered widget, and the child of that center

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,260
widget could be a card, and that's another widget that comes with Flutter.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,470
And on that card, I'll set the margin on the Card constructor here to Edge Insets all 20 to have a

33
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,680
little bit of margin around the cards, a little bit of empty space and the child of the card.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,190
So the content inside of the card should be a single child.

35
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:52,480
Scroll view, whoops, a single child scroll view so that we can scroll if the form elements should

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,390
take up too much space so that we never have a situation where one of the elements is unreachable.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,870
And inside of that single child scroll view.

38
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,450
On the other hand, I want to have some padding, so I'll use the padding widget here and set the padding

39
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,350
to edge insets all 16.

40
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,670
And these are just some values that I picked in advance that should look nice.

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,740
Of course, you can use different values here and play around with different values.

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:28,240
I'll take 16 as a pattern here, and then the child of the padding widget here is the actual form widget,

43
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,990
which will soon include all the form fields.

44
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,260
Now I'll just restructure this to make this a bit easier to read.

45
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,830
And this is the widget tree we have thus far.

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,160
Now, I can already tell that this form will be a bit longer.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,780
We'll have multiple form elements in there, and therefore I'll do one thing.

48
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,070
I'll actually grab this entire center widget here and cut it.

49
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:02,050
And in the widgets folder I'll add a new off folder and in that new off folder I will add my auth.

50
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,740
Form the dart file.

51
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,030
So did I basically outsource this off form into a separate widget just to make each widget on its own

52
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,450
a little bit more manageable and a little bit smaller.

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,340
Now, the off form widget will also manage the different input states of the user, and therefore this

54
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,750
actually also will be a stateful widget.

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,000
For example, we will need to be able to switch between, log in and sign up mode and update the UI

56
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,930
respectively.

57
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,330
So we need to manage some state in here.

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,890
Hence this is the auth form and we need to import material to start from flutter again.

59
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,500
And here instead of returning a container, I will return my center widget.

60
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,030
So the content I just cut from the off screen and therefore here in the off screen file as a body,

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,390
I can render this off form.

62
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,830
Now again, I just split this into two widgets to make each widget a bit more manageable.

63
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,180
Will of course, all to add some logic to have those widgets communicate with each other.

64
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,480
So make sure you add this input to the off form DART file and let's go back to the off form and work

65
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
on that form.

66
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,560
Now the form itself will have a couple of children.

67
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,280
Of course it can only have one child, but this child can be a column.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,410
And now we are able to define a couple of children, which are all part of that form.

69
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:41,260
Now I want to make sure that this column actually takes only as little space as it needs so that it

70
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:47,190
doesn't take all available space, but that it basically just takes the space its children need.

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,190
So I'll set the main axis size of this column widget to main axis size dot min.

72
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,010
And this makes sure that the column does not take as much height as possible, but only as much as needed.

73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,410
Now to define how much space is needed and to have all the inputs we need in the children here in this

74
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,420
list, inside of the column, I now want to render all the text form fields we need.

75
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:21,870
So here we can add the first text firm field for, let's say our email and a second text firm field

76
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,870
thereafter for the username and a third text form field for the password.

77
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,940
Now we'll not always need all of them, but that will generally be the fields we need.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,150
Of course, we'll also add image upload later though.

79
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,890
Now let's start with that first text form field here.

80
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,370
We want to take the email address of the user.

81
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:53,550
So I'll set the keyboard type here to text input, type, dot email whoops, type email address so that

82
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,230
we present the right keyboard.

83
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,550
We can also set the decoration of this text form field because as you'll learn in this course with the

84
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,600
decoration configuration here, you are able to set the label.

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,530
For example, decoration takes an object of type input decoration, hence will use this constructor

86
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,120
to create such an object.

87
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:23,600
And there we can now set the label text to email address and if we want also the label style, for example,

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,500
to be bold.

89
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,870
I'll not do that here though, but of course you could.

90
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,340
And in general you can, of course, style this entirely in the way you want.

91
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,300
This year is the first text form field.

92
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,250
It's missing a bunch of things, of course, and will soon add more logic.

93
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,020
But this is the base configuration, the minimal configuration I want.

94
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,620
Now on the next text firm field in line here I want to get the username.

95
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,730
So therefore here I'm fine with the default keyboard type.

96
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:00,550
We don't need to set a different type, but I want to set a decoration so that we can actually set the

97
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,240
label.

98
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,420
So here the label text is username to make it clear which kind of input we're expecting here.

99
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:16,740
And then the third text from Field also takes a declaration where we can set the label text to password.

100
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,500
And now important since this is a password, I also want to make sure that the input of the user is

101
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,210
hidden and we can do that by setting the obscure text configuration or argument on the text form field

102
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,950
constructor to true.

103
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,559
And this will hide the text entered by the user.

104
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,549
Now below all these text form fields, I'll add a sized box, which is a box that we can use to insert

105
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,510
some space, and I'll set the height here to 12.

106
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm doing this because below that I want to add a raised button, which in the end allows the user to

107
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,340
submit this form.

108
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:02,060
So the child of this button is a text widget where we can simply say, log in, though we will also

109
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,430
set this text dynamically soon.

110
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:12,120
We also should add on pressed here to define the function that should execute when the button is pressed

111
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,310
and right now this is just an empty dummy function because we don't have the final logic yet.

112
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,760
And with that, I'm done with this button right below it.

113
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,040
I will also add a flat button.

114
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,120
This should be the button we use for switching between.

115
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Log in and sign up mode.

116
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:37,640
So here the child is actually a text where I say, for example, create new account.

117
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,350
This text will also soon be set dynamically.

118
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,980
And I want to also add on pressed here and do nothing at the moment.

119
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,140
Okay.

120
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,500
Cool.

121
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,330
So that's the basic off for him, which does nothing but which we should be able to see.

122
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,930
So let's go to the main dart file and instead of the chat screen here on home, let's load the off screen

123
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,520
and make sure you therefore also add the import to the off screen here.

124
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,940
We can also keep the chat screen important because we will need that later again.

125
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:17,320
If you now save everything, you should see that log in screen here and that doesn't look too shabby,

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,080
but I want to use different colours here, so let's work on the theming in the next lecture.
