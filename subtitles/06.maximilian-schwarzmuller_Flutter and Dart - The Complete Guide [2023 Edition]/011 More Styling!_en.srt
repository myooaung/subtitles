1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,610
Were you successful?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,650
Let's do it together.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,890
So let's start by positioning the items and for that

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,430
let's go to our column here which holds the title and the date

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,860
and there, you learned that you can adjust the alignment with main axis and cross axis alignment

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
but what do we need here?

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,890
Remember in a column, main axis is top to bottom, cross axis is left to right.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:34,030
Since I want to change the positioning on the left to right, so on the cross axis from center which is

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,540
the default to start, I need to target the cross axis alignment here.

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,930
So let's set cross axis alignment to cross axis alignment.start

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,920
and this will move the items to the left.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Now let's work on the text style of the title.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,460
So here's our title and as you learned, you can add the style argument and instantiate a text style object

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,310
to control the style of this text.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:08,290
There, you can set the font size let's say to 18 and the font weight here, maybe to FontWeight.bold,

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,770
just like we did it for the amount. This looks better,

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:26,440
a little bit of a smaller font size, maybe 16, so that's looking good. For the date,

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,720
I want to give this a gray color, so therefore I'll give this a style as well,

19
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,960
text style because in there, in this object we can set a color property and I'll set this to colors gray,

20
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,040
like this.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,210
Okay, now with that, our transaction items here are taking shape,

22
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,720
certainly not the final form in which I want to have them

23
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,620
but a good start.

24
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,630
Let's now see with what we can continue.
