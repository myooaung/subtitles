00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.070
Now the chat screen, of course, needs a couple of elements.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.880
It, of course, needs a list of existing messages, which is scrollable.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
But we also need an input field which allows us to send a new message.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.340
And for that here under widgets, I'll create a new subfolder chat where I'll add a messages.

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.920
Dot dart file.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:33.210
And that should be a state less widget which will name messages where we can import material dart and

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.200
here the goal is to output all those, you guessed it, messages.

8
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.800
Now we can use cloud firestorm for that.

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.460
So package cloud firestorm, cloud firestorm dart.

10
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.930
And then the good old stream builder which we saw in action before to connect it to our fire store instance

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.710
and then here to a collection which should be the chats collection.

12
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.690
Now previously I had some documents here in chats for different chats, but actually we'll only have

13
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.060
one chat in this entire application.

14
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.330
So therefore it probably makes more sense to name this collection, just chat.

15
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.140
And of course therefore also make sure that in the rules it's just chat and not chats.

16
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.180
So now I just want to have a chat collection.

17
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.110
And in the chat collection I want to have my messages so we can directly listen on chat because that

18
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.350
will be the collection and the messages will be the documents in there.

19
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.390
And with snapshots, we therefore set up this stream.

20
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we need the builder where we get the context and the chat snapshot.

21
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.420
And here, just as before, we can check for the loading state so we can check if chat snapshot connection

22
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.310
state is in the waiting connection state, in which case we could return a centre widget where we basically

23
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.490
display a circular progress indicator and if we make it past as if check, we're not loading.

24
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.310
So then I want to return my list view.

25
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.360
So here I display list view builder.

26
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.390
And for the item builder, we get the context and the index and then simply return, let's say again

27
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.320
a text widget with the appropriate chat text at the moment.

28
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.230
Now for that, we need to know how many items we need.

29
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.570
So we also need the item count here.

30
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.780
And that should of course, be chat snapshot.

31
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.580
Dot data.

32
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.690
Dot documents.

33
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.490
Dot length.

34
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.450
And then here we can output the appropriate text by accessing chat snapshot dot data documents.

35
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.580
And since I repeated this, let's actually grab it and put it into a separate variable here.

36
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.090
Chat docs.

37
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.690
Is my documents array here.

38
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.060
So we use chat docs here and chat docs here for the given index and now on every chat document.

39
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.800
So on every message, in the end we should have a text, let's say, which should be displayed.

40
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.050
So we want to output the text here.

41
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.330
This could be how we render our list of messages.

42
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.110
Now back at the chat screen, messages should be rendered.

43
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.540
So here in the body, instead of having that stream builder, which we had before, we can get rid of

44
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.360
that and instead render a container, let's say where the child is actually a column where we then have

45
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.200
children.

46
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.260
And the first children I want to have is my messages, which that we just worked on.

47
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.420
And for that to work, you need to make sure that you also import the messages, start file into the

48
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.950
chat screen file.

49
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.810
So with that, I'm rendering messages here and messages.

50
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.600
Of course, renders a list view in the end.

51
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.350
And a list view instead of a column will not work that well.

52
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.650
You need to wrap this into an expanded widget, otherwise you'll get an error.

53
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.570
But with expanded you make sure that the list view only takes as much space as available on the current

54
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.149
screen whilst still being scrollable.

55
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.970
So that should display some messages.

56
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.710
Let's reload the application.

57
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.750
And we see nothing here, of course.

58
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.590
Now, that makes perfect sense because we have no messages yet.

59
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.600
Let's maybe simulate a message by adding a new collection, and that is this chat collection to which

60
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.410
I want to listen.

61
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.620
And we add a new document with a new auto ID.

62
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.030
And is there a text field where I say hello?

63
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.930
So this now could be a message sent by another user and if I click save here you see hello.

64
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.280
Appear here on the screen because of our screen builder here in messages.

65
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.860
So that is working exactly as it should.

66
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.610
Next up, let's make sure we have a bar at the bottom that allows us to send a new message.
