00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.866
So we've got quite a lot of folders and files here. Now

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.533
a lot of the files you see here are only there for configuration and a lot of the folders here also

3
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.066
don't need to be touched by you

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.166
but let me explain what each folder and file does.

5
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.400
Let's go from top to bottom,

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:24.700
the idea folder here holds some configuration for Android Studio.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.833
It doesn't really matter for us here because we're not working with Android Studio and you don't need

8
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.766
to change anything in here.

9
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.300
Vscode is a folder you might not have,

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.100
I have it here because I added some extra configuration for this project,

11
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:45.133
I set the zoom level so that you can see my code and anything you do configure for your vscode,

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.633
your Visual Studio Code project here would end up in such a config file and you don't need that if

13
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.100
you don't have any special development options here.

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.133
The Android folder is super important,

15
00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:01.900
it holds a complete Android project as you could also create it without Flutter.

16
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.800
This is is in the end

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.766
the project which the Flutter SDK will use to kind of merge with your Flutter code you could say, so

18
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:16.166
when your Flutter code gets compiled to native code, it will basically get injected into this Android

19
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.700
project you could say

20
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.866
and that is the Android project which later will be built into a real Android app or later actually

21
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:28.300
is the wrong word, which already got built into this Android app we're seeing here.

22
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.500
So this is in the end of normal Android project with your compiled Flutter code and you don't need to change

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.433
anything in here or very rarely and I will mention when you do need to change anything here. For the

24
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.400
most part, for the most time,

25
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.133
this is a passive folder which will be used by Flutter and therefore it's super important but not a

26
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:52.566
folder you work on. The build folder is also very important, in the end,

27
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.933
this holds the output of your Flutter application,

28
00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:04.100
in this case here also some Android or Java files and this folder is generated and managed by the Flutter

29
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.066
SDK.

30
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:11.466
You shouldn't change anything in there, that will all be done automatically by the Flutter SDK when you

31
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:16.900
are developing or when you are building your app for deployment, which we will do at the end of the course

32
00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:23.766
and therefore this is also a passive folder. So thus far, no folder in which we would work.

33
00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.666
It's the same for the iOS folder,

34
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:31.700
we had the Android folder with a full Android project, which is important for building an Android project,

35
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.566
both for development and for production and the iOS folder is simply the same for

36
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.366
iOS projects.

37
00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:43.366
And this holds a normal Xcode project, Xcode

38
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.366
is the development environment of MacOS, for iOS apps and just as with the Android folder,

39
00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:53.866
this is a folder where you really won't work in too much.

40
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:58.200
There are some occasions where we will do some work in here but I will mention when this is the case,

41
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.766
for the most part this is a passive folder which gets kind of merged with your Flutter code in the end

42
00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:12.066
and which will all be managed by the Flutter SDK to get iOS applications, both for development and

43
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:19.700
testing as well as for the real application in the end which you deploy. The lib folder is now the important

44
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.233
folder for us, lib stands for library and that is the folder where we will do 99% of our work.

45
00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:33.866
It is the folder where we will add all our Dart files, Dart is the programming language Flutter uses

46
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.366
to write the code for our Flutter application.

47
00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:41.933
So this is the folder where we will add files and where we will write code in,

48
00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:48.200
this is a super important folder for us. The test folder is a folder which won't be too important for

49
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.900
us here,

50
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.466
it allows us to write tests for our application, automated tests,

51
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.766
so basically code that runs our code and tests it for certain things,

52
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:04.700
certainly important once you're a bit of a more advanced Dart and Flutter developer but not important

53
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.233
for us right now and therefore, we can safely ignore this. gitignore is a folder that helps you when you're

54
00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:15.500
using git which is a source code management tool,

55
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.632
it allows you to create snapshots of your code, save them and you can go back to them at a later point

56
00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:21.065
of time

57
00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:28.933
if you messed up something or if you wanna change something. It is not a tool you have to use but often

58
00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.800
during development, git can be really useful

59
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.466
and after this lecture, you find a short text lecture on git. Using it is totally optional but if you

60
00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:43.433
want to use it, if that sounds interesting to you, that lecture will help you get started with it and then

61
00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.266
you can use it if you want to use it.

62
00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:53.466
The metadata file is not really a file we will work on, it will be managed automatically by Flutter

63
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.233
and in the end, the Flutter tool simply saves some information in here which it needs to build

64
00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.566
our application correctly

65
00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:02.866
and so on.

66
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.266
The same is true for the .packages file,

67
00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.733
it's not a file we'll do any work in,

68
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.433
this is generated automatically by the Flutter SDK and in the end,

69
00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:14.466
this also just manages some internal dependencies,

70
00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:15.866
some packages

71
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.400
this project needs and it is fully managed automatically,

72
00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:24.866
you should not delete it but you also shouldn't work in it. This file here,

73
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:25.300
this .iml

74
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:31.300
file which has your project name as a name is also file where we will not work in,

75
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.100
it's also managed automatically by the Flutter SDK to again manage some internal dependencies and some

76
00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.833
settings for this project

77
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:45.500
you could say and it's not a file which we'll change. Now the pubspec.lock file is also not a file

78
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.000
we'll work in and it becomes clearer once we understand the pubspec.yaml file which is a file in

79
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.533
which we will work.

80
00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:59.166
This is a file that allows you to mostly manage these dependencies of your project.

81
00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:00.633
Now what does this mean?

82
00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:05.500
This means that here, you can configure which other third-party packages

83
00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:07.766
your project might be using.

84
00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:14.266
You can also configure some other things in here, like for example fonts you want to use or images you

85
00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:19.433
want to use in your application and we'll use all these features, we'll work with third-party packages

86
00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:25.600
and we'll use fonts and images and therefore I will show you how to work with this file and how to change

87
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.333
it to include new fonts or new images,

88
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.400
I will show you all of that step-by-step.

89
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:38.666
Basically what you have here is code written in yaml which is a certain format for structuring text

90
00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:44.033
files, where you use indentation to express how code works together

91
00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:50.900
and here for example, we're right now specifying with which Dart version this works, which version

92
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.766
or application it should have, also which third-party packages we might be using, like here the Cupertino

93
00:06:56.766 --> 00:07:02.700
icons which allows us to use certain iOS styled icons in the application and

94
00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:06.300
we'll add other third-party packages throughout this course here.

95
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:15.566
So this is basically a config file that allows us to configure how our application works or which external

96
00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:19.466
dependencies it has, for the moment we don't need to change anything here.

97
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.533
The pubspec.lock file in the end is a file that is generated automatically based on your

98
00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:26.933
.yaml file here

99
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:34.433
and this simply holds more details then about all the dependencies you have and it is required by Flutter

100
00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:37.166
but it's not a file you will work, in the end

101
00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:39.366
as I said, it will be generated automatically,

102
00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:41.366
we will only work in the yaml file.

103
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:47.466
Well and the README file is an automatically generated README file which we can ignore, it holds some

104
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.733
information about our project and you could change this here

105
00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:56.000
if you were sharing your project with other developers and you want to give them some information. So

106
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.066
that was a thorough walkthrough through all the folders and files, the core takeaway is that we will work in

107
00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:07.266
the lib folder and sometimes with that pubspec.yaml file and we can basically ignore all other files

108
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:07.966
and folders.
