00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.600
Now in order to run the application on my real iOS device.

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.020
Which I have connected here and first of all, need to go to X code.

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.220
And then to my project here and under signing and capabilities, choose my team here.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.910
So that this error which was shown here, goes away.

5
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.500
And with that, I could not launch it for this button.

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.550
But I can now also try launching it here again through visual pseudocode.

7
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.030
And this should now work and hopefully successfully build this application for iOS and launch it on

8
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.930
my iPhone.

9
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.270
Now as a side note, if you should be getting any errors whilst you try to run this on a real iOS device,

10
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.070
try running, flutter clean in your project and then try restarting.

11
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.660
That's what I just needed to do.

12
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.129
But with that here on the right, you see my iOS device and I'm going to sign up there.

13
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.290
Since I cleared all data, I can, of course, use all those email addresses here again.

14
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.080
So that's that.

15
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.810
Now I'm going to pick an image.

16
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.400
Grant access to my camera.

17
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.050
And here I am, taking a picture of me taking a picture.

18
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.530
Great.

19
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.730
Use that photo.

20
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.860
Here it is.

21
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.290
And now I press sign up and that's looking good.

22
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.070
I'm on the chat screen and if we now go back here and we refresh the users here on authentication,

23
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.240
I see that new user under storage.

24
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.930
I hopefully see my image.

25
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.140
Here it is.

26
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.660
That's the image I just took.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.140
And under database, I also see the user's collection with data about that user I just created.

28
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.880
So that is all looking great.

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.520
That seems to work on iOS as well.

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.430
And with that, with that working well, let's actually continue and let's make sure that we show a

31
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.790
user image on all the chat messages we have.
