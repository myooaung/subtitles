00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.710
In the Dart DevTools, we also have more options here at the top.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.880
We're currently in the Flutter inspector with all these tools,

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.110
now there you always have a timeline,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.540
this can be useful for recording your app, if I now tap here, you see some bars appear here,

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.930
this can also be great for basically debugging performance but you should do that in production mode,

6
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.220
not in debug mode,

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.020
we even get a warning here that this is not really a good indicator for how our app would perform

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.940
once we ship it to an app store

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.990
but once we do have it in production mode, we can test it here with the timeline and basically get another

10
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.510
tool for understanding the performance of our app.

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.860
We can also spot its memory consumption, which can be useful for detecting memory leaks if that keeps on

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.460
growing over time and it never frees up memory, then you might have some spots in your code where you

13
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.750
maybe store data that you never use thereafter but you will also never let go of, also something

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.070
we'll have a look at later in the course. And then here, last but not least, logging shows you some log

15
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560
messages.

16
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.280
Well typically, that's not too useful but from time to time, you might find some useful information in

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550
here that you're interested in.

18
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.340
The most important tool however is your debug console here and for visual debugging, the Flutter inspector

19
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.420
with the tools I walked you through in this module.
