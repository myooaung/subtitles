1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,430
So now that you know what's inside of the course,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,670
let's dive into how you can get the most out of it.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,320
So of course, you should watch the videos,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,340
it's a video on-demand

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,360
course after all.

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,080
Watch them at your speed,

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,130
pause and rewind if I'm going too fast.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:21,500
I try to find the right balance for everyone but if you feel like I'm too fast, slow me down or pause

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,070
and go back to the start of the video again because you should also code along and do the exercises

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,790
and sometimes, that means that you have to pause the video so that you can code along,

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,920
that's okay.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,530
Some students don't code along, which is why I don't have super long pauses in my video since I want

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,150
to create a good course for these students as well but my recommendation really would be that you do

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,770
code along

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,100
because that's how you learn the most. And also, do the quizzes you'll find in the course,

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,450
some exercises I have in there.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,760
Do all of that, build your apps, build your own versions of my apps because that's how you ultimately

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,260
learn the most.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,160
Use all the course resources you find attached,

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,060
that's my source code which you can compare to yours if you're facing any errors

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,210
and also of course, check out the different slides and cheat sheets I attach to various lectures in the

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,740
course since that can be really helpful

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,670
or it can be really helpful resources if you are coming back to this course after a while or if you

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,800
are working on your own projects.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,020
Now if you're getting stuck and you did compare my code to yours, which you should always do first,

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,400
you can of course also ask in the Q & A section.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,030
I'm trying my best to help you there but I really can only help on questions that are directly related

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,920
to the course and to the course code

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,580
and I urge you to compare your code to mine first before you ask because most errors can simply be fixed

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,560
by comparing code and you'll learn much more if you can find and fix an error on your own

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,830
than when I tell you and you maybe don't fully understand what was wrong. And besides asking in the Q

32
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,480
& A section, also help others because you learn the most if you dig into problems, be that your own

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,000
problems or the problems of others and you solve them and you have to write down an answer and you have

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,440
to think about the problem

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,650
and if your answer is correct. Of course, you might answer in a wrong way but that's not a problem, you'll

36
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,740
get corrected and you'll learn again

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,080
but if you try solving problems, be that your own ones or the problems of other students, you will learn

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,280
so much more because you really have to think about a problem and find a solution

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,470
and that is what makes you a great developer in the end. So definitely take this opportunity to get the

40
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,030
most out of this course.
