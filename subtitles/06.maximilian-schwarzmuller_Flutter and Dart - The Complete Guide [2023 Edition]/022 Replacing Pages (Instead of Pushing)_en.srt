1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,800
Navigation works,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,700
let's now also go to the FiltersScreen and add a scaffold again, so that we have our centered widget

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,470
here on the body and in the appBar,

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,730
I have an appBar where I say your filters,

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,880
something like that

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,600
and with that, that looks way better

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,790
and now we have a problem here.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,420
I have a back button here

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,510
and with that, I can go back to the previous page.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,600
Now maybe that's actually what you want but I would like to have a hamburger icon up here, so that I can

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,410
open the same drawer which I have here.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,020
Now the solution is relatively simple,

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,560
all we have to do is in the FiltersScreen, we have to add the drawer again and reference our main drawer

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,260
and of course also add the import to that drawer here by going up one level and then to the widgets folder

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,660
and now we have that drawer icon here.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,730
But there's one behavior which I'm not liking, I'm always pushing my page which I'm loading on top of

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,510
that stack of pages.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,000
We're not seeing it here because we have no back button in the top left corner,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,200
thanks to the drawer but actually over time, we accumulate quite a big stack of pages because we never

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,340
delete the page we're coming from,

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,560
so we're not deleting the meals page or the tabs page here

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
when I go to filters

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,220
but then if I go back to meals, I also haven't deleted filters and the previous categories page.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,920
So the problem is that we get a stack of pages that's bigger and bigger over time because we never clear

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,790
the existing pages.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,820
Now that's no problem

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,350
if we just go into a category, into a recipe and then we have to go back at some time,

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,310
so we will clear that stack at some point of time

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,240
and we want that forward backward navigation there but here for the drawer, just like for the tabs, I essentially

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,600
don't want to have a infinitely growing stack,

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:08,199
instead I want to clear my stack and simply push the new page as the only stack page here onto my stack

32
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,700
so to say. So if I go to meals, the filters page should be deleted,

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,110
if I go to filters, the meals page, the tabs page here should be deleted automatically.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,640
Now it's easy to do that in Flutter, inside of the drawer, instead of using pushNamed,

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,200
you can use pushReplacementNamed or if you have no named route but you create it in place,

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,820
you also have pushReplacement and then you would pass a MaterialPageRoute here.

37
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,650
But for our named route, we have pushReplacementNamed and the difference to pushNamed without replacement

38
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,110
is that now you will replace the existing page on the stack with the new page.

39
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:55,280
So you don't add the new page on top of it in that stack of pages but you replace the existing page

40
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,700
and hence you would also not get a back button.

41
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,480
So with that, if I go to meals and filters, we have the same effect as before

42
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,200
but now we avoid that our stack gets bigger and bigger and we can clearly see that effect if I temporarily

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:16,790
comment out the drawer in my FiltersScreen. If I do so and I then full restart the app with the green arrow

44
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,120
here

45
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,850
and I then go to filters here, you see now we have no back button here

46
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,560
and the reason for that is that Flutter recognizes that nothing is on the stack, that there are no pages

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
to go back to because we didn't keep the old page and push the new one on top of it,

48
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,300
instead we replaced the old page, we deleted it and then added the new page and hence we can't go back

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,880
and this is sometimes what you want. Sometimes you don't want the user to go back but instead you want

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,210
to replace the existing page, for example also when you add user authentication, when you entered your

51
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:59,360
login data and you hit login and you then reach your main app, typically you don't want to provide

52
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,130
a back button to go back to the login because you already are logged in,

53
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,920
that would be another scenario where you would typically use pushReplacement instead of just push.

54
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,590
Well and here with the drawer, it's just another example to avoid an infinitely growing stack of pages

55
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,399
behind the scenes which could lead to memory problems at some point of time.
