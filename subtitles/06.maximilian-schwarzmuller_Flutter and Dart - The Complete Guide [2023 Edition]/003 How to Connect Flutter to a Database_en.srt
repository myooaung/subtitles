00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,760
So now that we know that storing data in the web or on the server can make sense, another question which

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,570
I see quite a lot is how can I connect Flutter or the same is true for web apps

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,510
actually to a database?

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,200
So how can I connect Flutter to a MySQL or NoSQL or whatever 

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,660
in this database

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,500
and with that, I mean a database that runs in the web on a server, not some on device database.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,840
The answer here is, you don't directly connect Flutter to your database because that's technically complex

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,610
and also insecure

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,600
and because it's insecure, it's technically complex because it's basically not a scenario which people

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,070
want you to use and therefore, there are no easy solutions to set up such a connection.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,620
Now why is it insecure? If you're connecting your Flutter app directly to a database, that means that

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,890
in your Flutter app code, you need to include your database credentials, your username and your password

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,670
to give you read and write access to the database.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,830
Now when you ship your Flutter app to the app stores and users download the app from there, of course

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,250
your source code is not easily available,

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,430
users can't read your source code when they install your app from the App Store but you can't rule out

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,560
100% that some users might get around that and might be able to get your app bundle and kind

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,860
of uncompile it and find out your credentials.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,260
It is definitely very challenging and unlikely but you can't totally rule out that this could happen

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,540
and then if people have your credentials for your database, they can access all your data of all your

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,280
users.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,570
They can delete everything, they can copy everything,

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,680
it's a nightmare,

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,850
so you definitely don't want your database credentials in your source code.

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,780
You want to have these credentials in a place which your users have no direct access to

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,100
and that would be a web server.

27
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,440
Therefore, you typically connect Flutter to a web server by sending HTTP requests there and then

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,890
the web server in turn reaches out to a database. The source code of the web server is stored on that

29
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,390
server

30
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,310
and yes of course theoretically, servers can get hacked but there are protection mechanisms against that.

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,060
Unlike your app, people can't just download it and then do their best to crack your code,

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,560
instead they have to crack your server first and if it's well protected, that will be almost impossible

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,070
or entirely impossible

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,350
and therefore having a web server which actually stores your credentials and interacts with a database

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,590
is way more secure and this is hence the approach which you want to use, you have a web server in-between

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,170
which establishes the connection to the database and your Flutter app only communicates with that web

37
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,010
server.

38
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,660
It's the same by the way if you are building a web app for the exact same reasons.

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,900
So this is the approach we'll also follow in this module, now we'll not write a web server from scratch

40
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,240
though because this is not a web development course and we don't use Flutter or Dart to create a web

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
server,

42
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:17,500
instead we'll use a service which is free to use, Firebase, which gives us a web server out of the box

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,110
where we don't have to write any code which just works and which also gives us a database attached to

44
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:29,440
that web server, to which it automatically communicates, so that we have an easy way of interacting

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,730
with that server and learn how Flutter talks to web servers.
