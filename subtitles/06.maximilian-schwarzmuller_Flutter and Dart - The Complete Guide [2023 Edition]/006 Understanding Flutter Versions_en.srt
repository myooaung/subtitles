1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,950
So now that we have a basic idea about what Flutter is and how it roughly works,

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,740
it's important to understand Flutter

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,030
is versioned. Flutter is relatively new,

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,190
it's been around for a couple of years but especially over the last year, it got a lot of traction and

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,690
it's really pushed by Google now and therefore Flutter versions are changing frequently.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,470
Now this does not mean however that Flutter changes all the time, that everything about Flutter changes

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,990
all the time. Instead,

8
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:39,020
indeed Flutter actually is pretty stable and the core API, the core features which you therefore also learned

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,690
about in this course will not change.

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,740
Instead, new versions bring bug fixes, small improvements, often also some behind the scenes changes which

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,980
you don't even see and maybe also some new niche features. So maybe some new features which you don't

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,680
directly need in your app or which now allow you to implement something in a different way than you

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,170
did it before but your old way also still works but you could now also use a different way,

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,220
these are typically the things that change. And therefore, you will of course also see that in this course,

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,260
I record a certain video with version let's say 1.6 and you're viewing the course when the

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,630
latest version is 1.9

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,450
but this does not mean that what you learn is not accurate anymore.

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,690
Instead this course is fully up-to-date and I will keep it up-to-date and actually, I already did replace

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,810
all the videos in the course once to improve the overall course quality and reflect a couple of important

20
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,340
new features.

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,740
I wouldn't have needed to do so because what I taught still was right,

22
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,090
as I mentioned it's not like everything changing all the time but there were some things that could

23
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,630
now be done in an easier way

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,440
since I recorded my first version of this course when Flutter was still in beta. Now it's been stable

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,410
for a while and therefore, no large changes are to be expected but whenever something does change or

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,540
does need updating, I will keep the scores up-to-date.

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,830
And now that we have that out of the way,

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,420
it's time to set up Flutter,

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,280
set up the development environment for Flutter and build our first little Flutter application. And as

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,330
a side note, the next videos actually are from my first version of this course,

31
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,300
therefore there, you still see the beta version of Flutter.

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,370
The setup hasn't changed a bit,

33
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,270
the look of the website has changed a tiny bit but the steps are the same,

34
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,440
the result is the same,

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,210
that's why I kept these videos around,

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,960
they're 100% accurate. Nonetheless but really keep this version thing in mind and whenever something

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,670
changes and doesn't work anymore,

38
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,250
I will fix it and update it,

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,220
no worries.

40
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,650
So with that, let's build our first Flutter app and see how Flutter actually works and how we can build

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,080
Flutter applications together.
