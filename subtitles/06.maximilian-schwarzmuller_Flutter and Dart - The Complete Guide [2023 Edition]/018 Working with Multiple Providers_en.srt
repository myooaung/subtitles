1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,990
To start using that card here.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,700
Let's first of all think about where we need it later.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,070
We'll need it in the products overview screen because they're in the app bar next to the pop up menu

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,400
button.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,980
Here in the app bar, I want to add a card icon which is displayed up there which we can click or tap

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,310
to go to the card screen where we see all the card entries.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,840
And on that card I can.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,410
I also want to show a label that shows us how many items are in the card.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,190
So we'll need information about the card here in the product's overview screen.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,600
We also need access to the card from inside the product item start file because there we have that shopping

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,190
cart button here, this one which allows us to add items to the card.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,790
And that, of course means that we need access to our card provider.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:54,610
And we'll later also have a separate card screen which shows us or which allows us to see what's in

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,060
the card.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,000
So we also need to access the card from there.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,300
Hence the card is another thing that makes sense to be provided in our root widget because we need it

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,780
in a couple of screens which are defined up there as well.

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,320
Now the problem is we already have a provider here.

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:19,390
Now, of course we could have a nested change notifier provider in here and simply provide our card

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,940
here as a value would be possible, wouldn't be wrong, wouldn't hurt performance, but gets pretty

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,180
ugly the more and more providers we add because we have a deeper and deeper nesting, thankfully.

22
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,000
The provider package has us covered.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,660
It gives us a special type of provider which allows us to group multiple providers together, and that's

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,520
the multi provider.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,780
Multi provider is a class you can create a few import from the provider provider package and multi provider

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,070
takes a provider's argument, which is a list of providers.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,570
Now to.

28
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,730
That providers list you simply add your providers like this change notifier provider value.

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,509
Of course, close that extra parentheses.

30
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,470
And at a parentheses here after providers.

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,490
And you're good.

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,910
So you simply have providers and next to that, then your child, which will simply receive all these

33
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,530
providers.

34
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,590
So in child here, you can tap into all providers you set up up there.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,440
So now you have one change notified provider here with no child here, it will simply get this child

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,190
and we can add another one here now which receives our card.

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,710
And for Dad, we just have to make sure that we import the card model or the card class.

38
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,730
So from the provider's file, from card start, we need to import this.

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,730
And with that import added, we can set up this change, notify provider at the closing parentheses

40
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,750
and we're good.

41
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,880
So now we're adding these to providers to the entire child widget tree down there.

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,270
And that means we can now listen to card anywhere in the application.

43
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,520
Now, again, stepping in here from the future.

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,180
As I mentioned earlier, the recommended way of solving this here when you provide a brand new object

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,710
is that you don't use the value constructor, but instead the create function in the default constructor

46
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,760
of change notifier provider which simply looks like this.

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,070
And you should do this for products and also for the cart.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,560
So that would be the recommended, the best practice approach.

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,930
The other approach, all the works fine here.

50
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,600
But again, as mentioned earlier, that is the current best practice of doing it.

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,650
Hence, of course, I want to show this here.
