00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.980
So with the format it let's make sure that we don't just print the inputs, but that we actually create

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.570
a new user with Firebase.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.180
Now earlier in the course, we used the provider package for managing the state and for sending those

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.520
HTTP requests.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.030
We could do this here.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.620
But as you will see throughout this module, we don't really need the provider package here.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.780
We don't really need this application.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:33.060
White State Management, because Firebase the Firebase SDK, which we're using, will basically manage

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.650
all relevant state for us because we have the live connection to the server.

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.190
And Firebase will also do some caching to cache data so that it's even available if we temporarily lose

11
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.210
the connection.

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.390
So we don't really need our own state management.

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.810
Hence I will not create any models or any state management classes.

14
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.690
I will not add the provider package.

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.700
Instead, we can go to the off screen and maybe handle the request to create a new user there, because

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.580
then we have the off forum for collecting all the inputs and the offscreen for the heavy lifting of

17
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.840
creating a new user.

18
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.810
For this year in the offscreen state, we can add a new function submit auth form maybe and this is

19
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.600
a function that should get all the data from the off form as parameters, so as inputs.

20
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.140
So there we can get an email which will be a string.

21
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.090
We can get the password which will be a string, the user name which is a string and also the information

22
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.640
whether we are in login mode or not.

23
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.010
And with all of that gathered here inside of the function will be able to use the Firebase SDK to create

24
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.890
a new user or sign an existing user.

25
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.230
In that will be step number two.

26
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.980
Step number one is that we connect this function here in the off screen state with our off form.

27
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.100
And that's, of course, something we covered extensively in the course.

28
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.539
We can simply pass down a reference to this method to off form.

29
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.730
So here to offer forum as an argument, we can pass down submit off form so we can pass down a pointer

30
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.930
at this method.

31
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.950
And now we just need to accept this inside of, of form.

32
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.540
So in the off form dart file here in the widget class.

33
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.270
We can.

34
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.080
At the constructor by repeating the class name.

35
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.090
And now I want to accept an argument and store this in a property of this class.

36
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.810
For this, I'll add a new property and that will be a function.

37
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.740
And we can actually even define how the function which we want to get as an argument should look like.

38
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.700
Now we'll get a pointer at that function, but we can define how the function will point.

39
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.480
It should look like it should be a function that returns nothing.

40
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.450
And for this you simply add white in front of function.

41
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.880
So function is the type of data we'll have.

42
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.300
But this is an extra piece of information for this function type and you can add parentheses here to

43
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.250
then also define the arguments.

44
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.110
This function, which we want to get or which we want to store here in the property, should have.

45
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.880
We also need to add the property name here and that will be submit FN, for example.

46
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.200
So we'll have a submit F and property here in off form.

47
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.410
And the type of this property is a function which returns nothing and which now should also get some

48
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.120
arguments, some parameters.

49
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.050
For example, an email, for example, a password.

50
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.860
Also, of course, the username and also the information whether we are logging in or not.

51
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.930
So the exact same arguments we do expect here in the off screen.

52
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.430
Here.

53
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.540
These arguments, they are mirrored here in this type.

54
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.380
And then here in the off form constructor, we can say this submit function to make clear that the argument

55
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.330
we're receiving here is bound to this property of this class.

56
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.250
And this property here will point at this function we're getting from off screen.

57
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.060
So now in try submit here instead of printing.

58
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.459
We can call widget, submit f n to execute this function.

59
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.020
We store it in the widget and to this function we now need to pass all that data.

60
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.430
We need to pass the email, the password to username and t is log in state.

61
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.680
So I pass user email, I pass user password and user name and also is log in.

62
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.250
All that information is passed to this function.

63
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.260
And with that back in the off screen will receive that.

64
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.930
And here we can now use the Firebase SDK to create a new user.

65
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.220
Let's do that in the next lecture.
