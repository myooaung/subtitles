00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,730
Before we write any code, let's first of all understand how we can store data in a Flutter app,

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,850
so in the app we're building here because we basically got two options.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,360
We can store data on the device,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,210
so in device storage and that kind of also includes in memory whilst our app is running, which is actually

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,030
the storage mechanism we were using thus far.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,730
All the products we were working in in our shop,

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,360
the products we added and we deleted, all of that was stored in memory which is why when the app restarted,

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,980
all of that progress was lost because the memory is reset

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:46,540
when the app restarts but we also have better device storage than just memory, which is very temporary

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,640
obviously, we can also store data on the device such that it persists

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,550
but the alternative to that also is storing data on a web server,

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:02,480
so outside of the device. Now if you store data in the device storage, it's always only available

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,150
for your app and therefore only for this user of your app, not for other users of your app who have the

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,680
app installed on other devices because

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,300
per definition, it's only stored on that device storage.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,500
Still, if you're not storing it in memory but you're using something like SQLite or some other device

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,180
storage options, the data will actually persist on your device across app restarts

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,130
which is great.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,760
Thus far, we're not taking advantage of this,

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,350
when we restart our app everything is lost,

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,680
all our state is lost because we only work with memory thus far,

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,420
you can also tap into other device storages which will survive app restarts and we will actually

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,840
use such a device storage later in the course when we have a look at user authentication.

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:57,200
Now an advantage about storing something on device of course is that it also works offline, you

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,680
don't need an internet connection because you just fetch it from your local file system on your device

26
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,330
so to say. Now the web server on the other hand has the big advantage that data which you stored there

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,410
is available for all users across different devices.

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,640
The data is not bound to a specific device because it's stored totally independent from the device your

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,460
app is running on some server in the web and therefore of course, data like the products in a shop

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,940
need to be stored on a web server because you're not just building the shop for the one user on one device

31
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,970
to use it but you want to have a shop where users install the app and then the data they see is centrally

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,600
available so that every user sees the same products and can interact with the same products. Just like

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,710
local storage or device storage, data that's stored on a web server.

34
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,150
of course restarts app restarts and even app installs,

35
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,690
so even if users uninstall your app and reinstall it, since the web server is not touched by this, the

36
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,630
data of course persists that and your app can always fetch that data from the server, no matter if it

37
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,450
was restarted, reinstalled or whatever

38
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,880
or if you are accessing your account from a totally different device for example.

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,980
Now obviously since it's a server in the web, you need an internet connection to interact with it though

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,500
and therefore, this only makes sense for data that should be shared across devices,

41
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,030
if you're just having data that belongs to your app and to your device, using a web server might not

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,700
be the best idea because whilst you can of course restrict the access to the user of your device, you

43
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,410
still would have the downside of requiring an internet connection which device storage

44
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,400
obviously never needs.

45
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,900
So using web server makes sense for a lot of scenarios and especially for scenarios where data should

46
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,530
be shared across devices and across users of your app, which is of course the case for a lot of data,

47
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,830
for any blog you're building, for news apps, for shops, for something like Uber and so on, they all need to

48
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,440
store data centrally on servers so that users can interact across different devices.
