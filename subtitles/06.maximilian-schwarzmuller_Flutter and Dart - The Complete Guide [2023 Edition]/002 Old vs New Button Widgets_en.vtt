00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.620
One of the more noticeable changes

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.620
introduced by Flutter 2,

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.620
is that the buttons which we used thus far in Flutter apps

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.610
are deprecated.

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.420
And with that, I'm talking about the RaisedButton,

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.040
the FlatButton, and the OutlineButton other buttons

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.060
like floating action buttons, or icon buttons

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.020
are not deprecated.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.890
It's these three buttons, which are deprecated.

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.380
And hence, if you use RaisedButton, FlatButton

11
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.150
or OutlineButton in your code and you are using Flutter 2,

12
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.800
you might see this strike through effect here

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.440
in visual studio code,

14
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.160
which signals that you should not use that button anymore.

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.770
Though I will come back to this should not use part

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830
in a couple of seconds again.

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.760
Now the most important message right away is that

18
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.580
even though you should not use them anymore,

19
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.760
you can absolutely still use them.

20
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.170
If I would run this simple demo app here

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.450
which really just renders these three buttons,

22
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.810
I can still see those three buttons on the screen

23
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.070
and they do work.

24
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.860
I can press them, I got no error, everything works.

25
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.060
I get my log outputs down there from pressing these buttons.

26
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.300
So I can continue using them.

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.410
And I don't have to change all of them right now,

28
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.190
I can do this later in the future.

29
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.223
And indeed you will still see these "old buttons"

30
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690
get used a lot in other resources

31
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.140
and example apps, which you'll find out there

32
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.140
and in existing code basis of existing projects.

33
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.210
That's another reason

34
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.550
why you might not wanna switch instantly

35
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.860
because you will still find a lot of resources out there

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.940
which do use these older buttons.

37
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.050
And then this course, I also use these buttons everywhere

38
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.230
because I did record this course with Flutter

39
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.610
prior to version two

40
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.760
and hence of course I am using these older buttons in there.

41
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.220
And at the moment, there's nothing wrong with that.

42
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.330
So, if you wanna stick to these older buttons

43
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.000
and you wanna get rid of that strike through effect,

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.350
you can go to your Settings

45
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.350
and search for Deprecated and then disable Show Deprecated.

46
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.860
And if you do that, then these buttons

47
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.210
are not having this strike through effect anymore.

48
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.190
So this can be something you might wanna consider doing,

49
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.053
if you wanna continue using those buttons.

50
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.390
Now I will enable it again, though.

51
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.350
Of course, the alternative to sticking to these buttons

52
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.420
is to migrate to their new equivalents.

53
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.660
Because these old buttons were deprecated

54
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.790
because there were new button widgets introduced

55
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.760
which you should use instead.

56
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.170
And we're now going to migrate to these newer buttons

57
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.650
step-by-step over the next minutes.

58
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.684
And let's start with the RaisedButton.

59
00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:06.963
The RaisedButton will be replaced by an ElevatedButton.

60
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.033
Now for the moment,

61
00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.650
we'll have to remove color and text color

62
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.180
because the ElevatedButton

63
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.370
does not support these arguments,

64
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.800
but if we would have a button without any custom colors,

65
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.050
then migrating to this new button

66
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.570
is as simple as swapping out the name.

67
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.940
Because it's then really just ElevatedButton

68
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.580
instead of RaisedButton.

69
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.010
And if I saved this, this button is still being rendered

70
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.180
and I'm now using this ElevatedButton.

71
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.090
Now, once you can already see here

72
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.990
is of course now that I migrated

73
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.950
or switched to this ElevatedButton,

74
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.600
we automatically have this blue background

75
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.150
and this white text color,

76
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.510
because the ElevatedButton behind the scenes

77
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.360
automatically picks up your main theme color

78
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.380
set by your application.

79
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.280
And that is blue in this case here.

80
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.480
And therefore we automatically get this styling

81
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.880
which is inline with our theme

82
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.630
which is one of the advantages of the new buttons.

83
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.270
We don't have to add styles manually,

84
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.730
we do get the base styling,

85
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.579
fitting our theme out of the box.

86
00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.170
But of course we can also still style them manually

87
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.170
to override the theme color or add other extra stylings.

88
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.020
And that's the biggest difference

89
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.810
between the old and the new buttons.

90
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.680
The old buttons had those extra arguments

91
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.830
which you could set for styling them like the text color,

92
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.300
the border side and so on.

93
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.640
The new buttons don't have that.

94
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.150
Instead the new buttons have a single new style argument

95
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.530
which you can set to then style this button.

96
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.180
And style wants a ButtonStyle object

97
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.480
which you construct by instantiating the button style class,

98
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.420
and it's then this ButtonStyle class

99
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.290
where you can set all kinds of styles for this button.

100
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.280
And here, for example, you got a background color

101
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.060
and you got a foreground color

102
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.030
and you would use these colors to control the text

103
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.960
and the well background color.

104
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.920
Foreground color sets the text as you see,

105
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.370
background color sets to fill color.

106
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.930
So here, if you wanna have a RaisedButton

107
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.160
with a blue background color and the white foreground color,

108
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.400
we could set background color here

109
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.293
but then not to Colors.blue.

110
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.550
You don't like this,

111
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.943
instead here, you then use materialStateProperty.all

112
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.420
and then pass Colors.blue to that.

113
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.600
Might look a bit strange,

114
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.530
but that is how you do then assign a color

115
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.540
to this background color argument here

116
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.510
for this button style object,

117
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.540
which we set as a style for this button.

118
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.420
And for the foreground color

119
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.010
it's MaterialStateProperty.all Colors.white.

120
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.270
And if we would set this,

121
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.800
then we would have this blue button still

122
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.910
but if I for example, switch my background color

123
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.623
to orange and saved this, now we have the orange button.

124
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.160
So that's how we then style these new buttons

125
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.110
with this extra style argument

126
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.650
which takes such a button style object.

127
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.050
Now, since assigning styles like this can be a bit annoying,

128
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.640
especially drilling into the colors like this

129
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.920
can be annoying,

130
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.730
there is an alternative way

131
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.650
of deriving this style for this button.

132
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.980
You can use ElevatedButton, but then not instantiated

133
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.271
but instead called a styleFrom method there.

134
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:51.190
And on this styleFrom method

135
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.890
you then get a couple of styling arguments like primary

136
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.370
and you can then directly set primary to a color

137
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.020
like Colors.blue,

138
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.800
and this will then affect all the parts of the button

139
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.320
that make up this button.

140
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.940
So for the ElevatedButton,

141
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.900
that button has a background color

142
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.910
and hence it's the background color

143
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.083
that's targeted by primary.

144
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.450
You got up on primary argument to control the color

145
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.010
off the content on the primary color.

146
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.680
So in this case, the foreground color on the background.

147
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.830
So you could then set this to Colors.white.

148
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.140
And for example, change this to orange here

149
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.200
and now with that, we would have a simplified way

150
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.813
of setting the background and the foreground color here.

151
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.420
And you can use either of the two approaches,

152
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.610
create this button style object

153
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.790
and set background and foreground color

154
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.180
which is very explicit but a bit longer

155
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.180
or use this styleFrom method to set primary and on primary.

156
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.560
Now attached to this lecture, you also find a link

157
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.800
to the official button migration documentation,

158
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.220
a document which will also explore

159
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.180
how to migrate your buttons

160
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.770
and which we'll dig a bit deeper into styling these buttons,

161
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.493
and therefore you can check out that document as well.

162
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.590
Now that's the ElevatedButton

163
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.200
which is our old RaisedButton.

164
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.874
Now for the FlatButton, we now have the TextButton.

165
00:08:29.874 --> 00:08:32.240
The TextButton replaces the FlatButton

166
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.289
and just like the ElevatedButton,

167
00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.789
it doesn't have these individual style arguments anymore.

168
00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.919
Instead it has one style argument

169
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:45.000
and here again, you set a button style by instantiating it,

170
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.770
and then there you can set the foreground color

171
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.230
to control the text

172
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.100
and also still a background color

173
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.410
if you wanna add a background color.

174
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.430
By default the text button not have a background though

175
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.380
because the idea behind that TextButton

176
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.520
is that it's just text no background color,

177
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.040
but alternatively to setting this button style

178
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.640
with foreground and maybe background and maybe other styles,

179
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.240
you can also use TextButton style from here again

180
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.870
and then here set primary:Colors.blue, or maybe orange

181
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.860
so that we see a difference.

182
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.460
If I save this now, the text is orange and that's important.

183
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.860
Primary is not always the background color,

184
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.690
instead primary really targets the primary thing

185
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.090
that makes up this button

186
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.560
and for an ElevatedButton

187
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.970
the primary element is the background

188
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.500
because that's the main thing

189
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.000
that makes up a ElevatedButton.

190
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.730
It's a button with a background

191
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.050
and therefore primary targets that background.

192
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.570
And on primary targets the foreground

193
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.180
or the TextButton, the primary element is the text

194
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.510
and hence primary targets to text color.

195
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.360
Here, we also have no on primary argument we could set

196
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.640
because the TextButton

197
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.760
is about not having a background color.

198
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.420
If you want the background color, use an ElevatedButton.

199
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.720
So that's how we can translate the FlatButton.

200
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.873
Now for the OutlineButton, we have the new OutlinedButton.

201
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.230
So the extra d here matters

202
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.153
and that will then replace your old OutlineButton.

203
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.990
Here, we again don't have those individual style properties

204
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.430
instead, we can add the new style argument here

205
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.610
and set this to a BorderStyle again

206
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.890
where we then target the individual styling elements

207
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.890
like side for the border side

208
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.070
so the border of color ends on

209
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.173
or we use OutlinedButton.styleFrom

210
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.360
and then here again, we can, for example

211
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.060
set the primary color to Colors.orange.

212
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.270
And if we do that,

213
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.510
you will notice that now it's the text again

214
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.113
which is orange.

215
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.470
For styling the border, we have this side argument here

216
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.470
and you can always use the other completion

217
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.030
to see which different arguments you can set here.

218
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.500
And that wants a border side object

219
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.720
which you construct by calling the BorderSide constructor

220
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.623
and then there, you can set the color off the border side.

221
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.060
So off the border overall.

222
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.803
And if you now save this, you have an orange border.

223
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.650
And that's how we can migrate

224
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.710
from the old buttons to the new buttons.

225
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.720
RaisedButton becomes ElevatedButton,

226
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.891
FlatButton becomes TextButton

227
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:45.891
and OutlineButton becomes OutlinedButton with an extra d.

228
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.820
For simple cases where you don't set any colors or styling,

229
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.430
you can just swap the widget names for more complex buttons

230
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.080
where you do add your own colors or your own stylings.

231
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.040
There you instead add this style argument

232
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.970
instead of the individual style arguments.

233
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.450
And then there, you either create a button style object

234
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.330
with foreground background color and so on,

235
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.330
or you use these style from methods on the button classes

236
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.570
to assign primary colors, background colors, border colors

237
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.653
and so on.

238
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.503
Now, as I mentioned,

239
00:12:24.503 --> 00:12:27.160
you can stick to the old buttons as well,

240
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.320
they will definitely also stay around for many months

241
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.410
but you can of course,

242
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.060
also migrate to these new buttons instead

243
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.480
because over all, as you see

244
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.240
migrating isn't too difficult in the end.

245
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.860
It's often just about swapping the names

246
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.570
or also about adding these extra style arguments

247
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.363
which then in the end also, aren't too difficult to use.
