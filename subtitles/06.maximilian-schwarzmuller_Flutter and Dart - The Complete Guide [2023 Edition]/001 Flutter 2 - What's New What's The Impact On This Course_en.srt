00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,220
On March 3rd, 2021, Flutter 2 was released.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,590
And in this lecture and video

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,630
I'm going to explain what this means for Flutter,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,527
for your code and for discourse.

5
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:19,050
And of course I'll also show you how you can upgrade Flutter

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,820
and your apps to Flutter 2.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,600
Now, let me start with

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,250
the most important piece of information first.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,940
Flutter 2 sounds like a big change

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,120
like a totally new version

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,430
that introduces a lot of new features or changes a lot.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,210
And indeed it is labeled a major upgrade

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,380
but if we take a closer look,

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,650
we learn that actually not much changes.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,860
Indeed the biggest new feature,

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,200
which is also advertised and emphasized

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,990
by the Flutter team itself

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,990
is that now we can build Flutter apps for any platform.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,800
And that's the biggest new thing.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,380
Flutter historically, was a framework using dart

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,230
to allow you to build cross-platform mobile apps

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,710
iOS and Android apps.

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,670
Now over the last months and years even

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,130
the flutter team worked towards the goal

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,100
of making Flutter a framework

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,320
which you can use to build apps for any platform,

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,840
including web apps.

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,620
So websites, which you open in the browser

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,950
and also desktop apps for Mac iOS, windows, and Linux.

30
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,380
And this sounds big and it indeed has to potential

31
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,870
of becoming a big major thing for Flutter

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,010
but at the moment, I'd say we're not there yet.

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,140
It turns out that support for windows macOS and Linux

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,330
at this moment at this time is still in beta

35
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,620
so it's not production ready yet.

36
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,150
So whilst you might be able to build windows,

37
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,890
macOS and Linux apps with Flutter,

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,890
it's not really at the point

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
where these apps could really be distributed to your users.

40
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,250
Now, when it comes to Flutter for web apps.

41
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,630
So for websites,

42
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,970
that feature is actually labeled production ready

43
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,440
by the flutter team,

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,150
but I don't fully agree there yet.

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,740
You can use Flutter and one code base

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,180
to build an app that runs on iOS, Android, and the web,

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,160
but when it comes to web development,

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
I don't feel that the apps Flutter spits out

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,160
are on the same level performance wise, for example

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,850
than native web apps built with native web technologies.

51
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,240
So yeah, this might become better in the future

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,740
but at this point of time

53
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,350
I personally don't plan on using Flutter for web apps.

54
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,380
Whereas I absolutely do think that building mobile apps

55
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,510
with Flutter is more than production ready.

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,020
So that's the first big feature

57
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,750
having this better cross-platform support

58
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,280
and with all the explanations

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,100
I gave you over the last minutes

60
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,990
it's hopefully clear that the impact of that

61
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,190
is not that big.

62
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,220
You can experiment with those new platforms

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,450
but the code you'll write is not impacted by that

64
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,540
and it also doesn't shift the main focus

65
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,430
and the main selling point of Flutter,

66
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,990
which is the mobile app part.

67
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,510
Now, if you dig a bit deeper into Flutter 2,

68
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,700
you will actually all defined very long release notes

69
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,760
with tons of information in there.

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,370
But it turns out that even though those notes along,

71
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,600
we mostly have fixes and small improvements here

72
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,740
nothing that would really impact your code

73
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,750
and change the way you write code with Flutter.

74
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,690
Now, there is one exception

75
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,240
and I updated some lectures in the course already

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,330
to reflect that.

77
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,940
And that would be Buttons.

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,560
With Flutter prior to version two,

79
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,270
you use the RaisedButtons, FlatButtons

80
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,580
and ElevatedButtons in your code

81
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,010
to bring some buttons onto the screen.

82
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,180
With Flutter version two,

83
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,450
those buttons are actually marked as deprecated now.

84
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,830
And in visuals duo code you might see

85
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,560
that they are having this strike through effect.

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,959
Now deprecated

87
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,970
does not mean that you can't use them anymore.

88
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,700
They will stick around for many months to come

89
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,400
and actually I would argue that in most projects that exist

90
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,430
and in most examples and other resources like Abra tutorials

91
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,480
you will still see those old buttons.

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,730
And this course also uses those old buttons

93
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,600
because of course,

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,380
this course was not recorded with Flutter 2.

95
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,380
Now you can switch to the new buttons

96
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,390
and in the lecture after this one,

97
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,080
I will quickly walk you through the migration path

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,270
from old buttons to new buttons

99
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,270
and I did also update some lectures in the course

100
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,920
where I first introduce a RaisedButton and FlatButton

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,540
to make you aware of these new buttons there as well.

102
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,620
But for going through that course,

103
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,390
I do strongly recommend

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,810
that you do stick to RaisedButton, FlatButton and so on

105
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,110
since that will make the course experience a bit smoother.

106
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,890
And if you wanna get rid of that warning

107
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,570
that strike through effect,

108
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,630
you can always go to your settings in visual studio code

109
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,570
search for deprecated there

110
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,560
and disable this "show deprecated" feature.

111
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,303
You can of course always migrate to the newer buttons

112
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,480
thereafter if you feel like it.

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,190
It will just make going through that course of it's smoother

114
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,840
because you don't have to adjust that code all the time.

115
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,710
Now, if you do want to migrate

116
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,900
from the old buttons to the new ones though,

117
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,110
check out the lecture after this one,

118
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,070
because dare I will show how you do migrate

119
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,420
and how you do change your code.

120
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,750
Now, before you can migrate any code

121
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,400
and before you can use Flutter 2 though,

122
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,730
you need to upgrade.

123
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,860
And that's very easy,

124
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,490
you just need to open up your terminal or a command prompt.

125
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,510
And in there, if you run flutter upgrade

126
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,730
that will simply download

127
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,270
and install you the latest version will Flutter

128
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,480
globally on your system

129
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,240
as you see, I already did update,

130
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,290
which is why it's telling me that I well,

131
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,490
have the latest version

132
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,910
and that will then upgrade for you as well.

133
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,780
And thereafter all your projects

134
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,763
will automatically use the Flutter 2 if you want to.

135
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,260
Now, of course, with such a long list of fixes

136
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,460
and minor and new features

137
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,920
there're of course are more features.

138
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,460
And that's why I also linked

139
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,700
the official announcement blog post here,

140
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,530
and also the more technical Flutter specific

141
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,800
insightful blog post.

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah, they basically just have two block posts

143
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,780
for announcing Flutter 2,

144
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,330
one marketing overview block posts

145
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,650
and one word technical block post both are linked.

146
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,710
Now in this blog post, you also find more details

147
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,800
about this update, more technical details

148
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,610
and for example, you also learn about new iOS features

149
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,380
and new widgets that were added.

150
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,990
You can of course, look into those

151
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,500
and play around with those as well.

152
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,333
But overall,

153
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,420
there really just aren't any code breaking changes.

154
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,330
Nonetheless, I also wanna point out a special tool

155
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,400
which the Flutter team now added.

156
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,370
And that's the the Flutter fixed tool.

157
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,690
It is a tool which you actually invoke

158
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,780
by calling dart fix in the command line of your projects.

159
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,190
And if you run that command,

160
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,800
if you run dart fix in your command prompt in your terminal

161
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,140
navigated into a project folder that will analyze your code

162
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,450
and make any changes that might need to be made.

163
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,720
Now at the moment, there aren't a lot of changes

164
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,870
that would need to be made, but nonetheless

165
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,460
it is worth knowing about dis tool as well

166
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,290
especially also for future Flutter updates

167
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,310
which then again might break more things.

168
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,400
And therefore, there are only two last questions.

169
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,090
What does Flutter 2 mean for you, your code and your apps

170
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,920
and what does it mean for this course

171
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,150
and your course progress.

172
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,770
Now, as I mentioned, despite his long list,

173
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,870
the only real feature or change that will impact your code

174
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,650
is that new buttons thing, which I mentioned

175
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,740
and which I'll dive in in the next lecture.

176
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,710
Besides that, the code will stay the way you'll learned it

177
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,713
and hence there aren't any major changes needed

178
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,840
to your code.

179
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,730
And even that change is technically optional as you learned.

180
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,090
You can stick to the old buttons,

181
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,270
deprecated does not mean that you can't use them anymore.

182
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,960
So even that change is optional

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,809
and hence there aren't any major code changes needed.

184
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,350
You can upgrade to Flutter 2, and you should be fine.

185
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,360
Now you can explore those new platforms if you want to

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,880
but of course you don't have to do that either.

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,700
You can stay focused on iOS and Android apps if you want to.

188
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,580
And for example,

189
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,690
that is what I will keep on using Flutter for personally,

190
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,200
Android and iOS development, at least for now.

191
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,500
And what does it mean for discourse?

192
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,530
I don't plan any big changes to this course right now.

193
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,370
Yes, I'm of course using those old buttons,

194
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,910
but I hope with the next lecture

195
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,570
and those minor adjustments

196
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,910
which I made to some of the lectures in the course,

197
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,420
I can make it clear how you can change to those new buttons

198
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,490
but that you don't have to change.

199
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,650
And other than that, there really aren't any major changes

200
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,930
that would impact this course.

201
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,380
Of course, those new operating systems are interesting,

202
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,340
but since three of them are still in beta

203
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,290
and the web support doesn't fully convince me yet,

204
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,730
I don't plan any near term additions or changes

205
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,690
related to that as well.

206
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,630
Now I will keep this course overall updated

207
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,810
and I won't rule out more major course upgrades

208
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,680
in the future

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,520
maybe I'll even redo the course entirely again

210
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,870
in the future, but for the very near term,

211
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,870
there are no such changes planned

212
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,090
simply because Flutter 2 despite its name,

213
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,853
doesn't change that much.
