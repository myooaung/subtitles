1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,550
Now for this module and for this course, we'll use Firebase which is a Google service.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,770
You can visit firebase.google.com to learn more about it

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,790
and whilst it sounds like the name of a database, it actually is a server-side solution offered by Google

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,420
which gives you a lot of services,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,410
we only need a few of those and amongst these services is a web server with an attached database.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,920
So you basically get a database and a server that talks to the database as one service

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,750
and that's exactly what we need here because we can then use this web server to communicate with it

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,680
and automatically have that server then communicate to a database out of the box without us writing

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,150
any server-side code.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,550
You can also use it for free,

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,180
all you need is a Google account

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,400
and once you did login with your Google account, you can simply go to that Firebase console there to

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,680
then create a new project here.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,090
Now I already did create one, if

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,410
you're creating a new one

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,650
you simply need to check these boxes here and then create a new project with any name you like

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,570
and once you're in the project,

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,070
you should see a starting screen that looks something like this.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,840
Now in here as I said, you have a bunch of options, Firebase has a lot of services and this is not a course

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,460
about Firebase and I will not turn it into one,

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,430
so we'll not cover Firebase here,

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm only using this as a dummy back-end because it gives us a web server where we don't have to write

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,450
any code and which we can then use to learn how Flutter talks to such a web server

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,870
and the knowledge you learned in this course therefore is applicable to any back-end, to any server

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:44,050
you use, not just Firebase and that's important by the way. If you search for Firebase Flutter, you actually

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,060
find out that there is an official documentation on how to add Firebase to your Flutter app and they

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,920
do this through the Firebase SDK for Flutter which is essentially a Flutter plugin you install.

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,570
Now you can do this if you really want to use Firebase and all its services it offers,

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,910
so also things like analytics, machine learning and all the stuff this service offers and a lot of that

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,630
will then also be a paid service, if you want to use that then of course the official SDK, the Firebase

31
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,510
SDK or the Firebase plugin for Flutter is a great idea because it makes working with these Firebase

32
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,170
services easier.

33
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,160
I don't use the Firebase plugins here because I don't want to teach you Firebase plus Flutter which

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,960
won't help you much if you ever build a Flutter app that needs a different back-end but instead, I want

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,750
to teach you Flutter with any back-end and therefore we'll just use the generic parts of Firebase which

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,110
you can easily replace with other back ends,

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,890
so I hope that's clear.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,250
So in the Firebase console, the interesting part for us right now is the database.

39
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,490
Now it might look here like we're setting up a database to then talk directly but always keep in

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:58,240
mind, Firebase abstracts away a lot of the complexity and therefore, it looks like we send requests directly

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,030
to a database,

42
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,710
we will send requests to a Firebase server which then simply translates that into instructions, into

43
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,620
query statements it sends to the database.

44
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,630
Now for that, we need to create a database and we'll not use Cloud Firestore because that's a bit of

45
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,280
a more complex database,

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,390
we'll use the real-time database which you should find if you scroll down a bit.

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,680
There, you simply can create a database and start in test mode,

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
that's important, because this ensures that everyone can read and write

49
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,190
and for this module, that's what we need.

50
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,040
Later in the authentication module, we'll lock that down and I will show you how authentication could

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,550
work in such an application.

52
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,880
This is the screen you should then see

53
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,880
and this is in the end your web interface where you can see the data which will be stored in database

54
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,570
and where you also get a URL, which is at least a part of the URL to which you have to send

55
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,270
your requests so that they are automatically translated into database queries

56
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,420
and that's really important.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,640
You don't directly talk to a database here,

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,890
you talk to a web server which has this URL or which has different URLs which will always

59
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,710
start with this one and then that web server knows how to interpret certain HTTP requests to

60
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,080
then interact with your database,

61
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,000
that's how that works.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,970
So with that setup, let's now dive back into our Flutter code and make sure that there, we can now add

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,970
products which are stored in the cloud on a web server and that we can then also load the data from

64
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,080
there and so on.
