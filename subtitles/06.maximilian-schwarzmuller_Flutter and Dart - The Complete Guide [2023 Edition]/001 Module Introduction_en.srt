1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,650
In this course, you learned all about the building blocks you need to build amazing Flutter apps.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,630
Now it's also time to learn how you can publish such apps to the app stores

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,470
so that you can share your apps with your users and don't just have them on your machine.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,170
For that, let's first of all have a look at these steps it takes to publish an app before we will then

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,210
of course go through all these steps here

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,550
step-by-step.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,000
The first step is a step we basically already did,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,950
you have to test and optimize your code.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:36,920
The testing part really means that you should test it on a broad variety of devices, if possible on real

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,470
devices and also on older devices

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,670
and of course you want to optimize your code regarding its performance and so on.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,730
Now I'll come back to this here in the next lecture

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,050
but this of course is a crucial part to make sure you're shipping an app that works. As a next step,

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,850
you should set your application name and identifier and also manage the version number of your app before

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,410
you deploy it.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,070
Once you're done with that, make sure that any third-party services you're using,

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,700
like for example the Google Maps API are configured correctly to ensure that your users can really only

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,010
do what you want them to do.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,290
The next step thereafter is that you of course probably want to have your own app icons and a nice

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,720
splash screen and therefore, we'll also have a look at how you can add that, how you can add nice looking

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,840
app icons and a splash screen to your application.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,210
The splash screen is that screen which the users see whilst your app is loading up, so whilst your app

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,460
resources are getting loaded.

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,020
And last but not least of course, you have to publish your app to the app stores and we'll also have

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,240
a look at how that works in this module as well.
