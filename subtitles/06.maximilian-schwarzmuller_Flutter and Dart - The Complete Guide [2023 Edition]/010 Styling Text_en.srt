1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,790
The text style can of course also be changed, not on the container but on the text itself. On the text if

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,560
you use control space,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,140
you see you've got a bunch of arguments to configure how that text is rendered,

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,340
for example also what should happen if it exceeds the box it's inside. Here however, I'm interested

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,810
in the style which is of type text style,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,590
so indeed you should create a text style object and now you can configure a lot of stuff about the text.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,670
You can set its shadow, you can set a height and so on, here I want to set the font weight and I'll

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,100
set that to FontWeight.bold, font weight

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:47,140
here is a class with a lot of static properties like bold. So we don't instantiate font weight,

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,990
instead we access .bold like this because it's a static property.

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,150
Keep in mind, static properties are basically like enums, just that it's not a number with a label but

12
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,010
a more complex value with a label. That value

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,230
however, that complex value is then used by the text style in conjunction with the text widget,

14
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,900
so you just set this and you get a bold text.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,390
You can also change the size, so we can set the font size here maybe to 20.

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,980
If you do that, it's bigger.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,800
Please also note that the surrounding card and the container are automatically adjusted to the increased size.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,910
So by default, that container grows with the content which is of course good.

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,430
So now we have this,

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,140
let's maybe also fine tune the color and for that here on the text,

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
we can go to style and set the color and let's set this maybe to purple which is one of the built-in

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,820
colors on that colors class.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:50,930
Again, this is a static property on the colors class, just like font weight, colors acts as a grouping mechanism

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,380
and for the container where I also want to change the border color now, well we do that here when we set

25
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,180
up that border, so I'll change this to purple as well

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,690
and now we have that purple box.

27
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,870
So this is looking good, now as a little extra size, try doing similar style adjustments for your row.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,860
I want to make sure that all the items are positioned on the left by default and not centered,

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,280
you learned about this earlier in this module and change the text styles there as well.

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,510
The title should also be bold, a little bit bigger not as big as the amount but a little bit bigger

31
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,630
regarding the font size and the date, whilst it still looks ugly,

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,470
should have a grayish color, so not black but grey and it should definitely be smaller than

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,930
the title here.

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,690
These are the adjustments I will make, in the next lecture,

35
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,730
definitely try it on your own first.
