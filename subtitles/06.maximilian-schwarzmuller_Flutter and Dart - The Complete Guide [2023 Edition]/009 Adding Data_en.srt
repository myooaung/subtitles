1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,760
Whilst it is nice that we can see our messages here, it would be nice if the plus button would at least

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,350
add some dummy message.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,730
So that's what we're going to do.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,190
Now we have the plus button already.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,070
We get the on press handler for the plus button.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,780
So now all we need to do is we need to make sure that a new message is added.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,730
And for that we can again use fire, stalked instance and reach out to the collection where we want

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,900
to add a document.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,310
And that's this same collection to which we're listening here in The Stream Builder.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,100
So let's add it here.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,860
But now we don't call snapshots because I'm not interested in the snapshots.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,040
Instead, we can call add and add will do what the name sounds like.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,990
It adds a new document.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:53,310
Now, on the flatter side, a new document is represented by a map, and you create maps in dart by

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,220
using opening and closing curly braces like this.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,980
And then you can add key value pairs, which will be the key value pairs in your document.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,440
And there we can add a text key because we're using text in the other documents as well.

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,830
And add any text of your choice like this was added by clicking the button.

19
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,000
And for now, it's hard coded.

20
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,700
Later will, of course, fetch some user input here.

21
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,830
So if you saved us again, we'll see two entries.

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,570
But if I now click the plus, you see, this was added by clicking the button.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,060
You see, the order is a bit strange.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,290
The order jumps around, but you see that's getting added here.

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,130
And you also see that's getting added here on the back end.

26
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,560
And if you click through here, you'll see the order we have here actually is the same order as in the

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,210
Flutter app we got.

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,050
This is the number entry as to bottom most and that's the case here as well.

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,480
Now, don't worry about that order thing right now.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,800
We'll take care about this later and we'll make sure that everything is ordered correctly.

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,970
With that, however, we have this basic introduction to Firebase.

32
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:09,470
We saw how we can connect Firebase to the Flutter app, and we see how that data base flutter communication

33
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,970
generally works.

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,720
Now, of course, that's not everything we're going to do in this module.

35
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,840
Actually, it is quite a bit away from the final result, but this is a super important first step.

36
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,910
With that, however, we're going to take a step back.

37
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,950
We're going to work on the styling a little bit.

38
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,070
We're going to add the authentication screen and we're going to start from scratch and make sure that

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:36,980
we have some users before we then work on allowing those users to send messages.
