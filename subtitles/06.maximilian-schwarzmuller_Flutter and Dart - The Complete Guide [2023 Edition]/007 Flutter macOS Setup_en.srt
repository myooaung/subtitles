1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,100
Now you can use Flutter

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,100
and build apps with Fluter on macOS, Windows and Linux.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,230
In this video I will show you

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,166
how to set up Flutter on macOS.

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,110
In the next video,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,390
I will show you how to create a project on macOS

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,010
with Flutter and how to set up the development environment,

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,900
where we will write our code.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,530
In the lectures thereafter, I'll show the same for Windows.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,210
So if you are using a Windows PC,

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,390
you can of course skip this and the next lecture,

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,550
since they don't apply to you.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,950
Now, if you are a macOS user,

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,230
it all starts with visiting Flutter.dev

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,820
On this page, you can click on docs

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,354
and there on get started.

17
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:49,660
And then here you can choose your operating system,

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,770
here you also find instructions if you use Linux

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,610
or Chrome OS which you can use as well.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,340
Now for us, of course, macOS applies.

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,260
Now you can always check out the official documentation here

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,590
to find detailed written instructions,

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,860
which you can use in addition, or instead off this video.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,760
But of course, I will also just walk

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,130
through these steps together with you.

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,910
It is worth pointing out that at the point of time,

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,310
I'm recording this,

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,610
you might wanna check out these extra resources

29
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,520
if you are on a Mac that uses

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,640
the relatively new M1 processor.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,920
Now, the Flutter team is working on improving support

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,140
for this processor,

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,950
so this might not apply in the future anymore,

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,370
but if you are facing any issues and most notably,

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,560
if you still see this box here on this documentation page,

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,280
when you are visiting it,

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,050
then you might wanna check out these extra notes

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,050
to avoid problems when using Flutter on M1 Mac.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,340
Now, no matter which kind of Mac you are using,

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
what you will need is you will need

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,570
to meet these system requirements here

42
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,220
and most notably you should ensure

43
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,479
that you have git installed, which is an extra tool.

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,090
We'll do that in a second

45
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,610
and you have to have Xcode installed.

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,430
If you do have Xcode installed, that includes this git tool

47
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,770
so then you don't need to install it separately.

48
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,410
You can install git separately if you want though,

49
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,150
and you can just follow this link to do that.

50
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,440
Now here on this page,

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,210
you will find different ways of installing git,

52
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,730
again Xcode has it installed.

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,750
You can use a homebrew if you've got that installed,

54
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,860
or you simply download that installer,

55
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,510
which will give you a well installer interface

56
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,080
through which you can walk to install git with help of that,

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,040
whatever you prefer.

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,590
Now, I did already install git on my system

59
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,560
and any ways as mentioned multiple times,

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,060
you get it together with Xcode anyways,

61
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,430
but you should ensure that git

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,700
is installed on your system in the end.

63
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,280
git is an extra tool which you can use

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,860
for managing source code

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,070
and different versions of source code

66
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,350
and the Flutter SDK uses git under the hood,

67
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,423
which is why you need to install it.

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Now you'll also need Xcode.

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,910
That's an extra tool, which you can only use on Mac systems,

70
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,990
not on Windows or Linux,

71
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,580
and it's still official development environment provided

72
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,470
by Apple for building iOS apps.

73
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,300
Whilst we won't use it to write code,

74
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,130
Flutter does need Xcode under the hood

75
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,890
to build apps for iOS, that's why you need to install it.

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,130
Now to install Xcode, you just can open up the app store

77
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,050
on your Mac system and search for Xcode there,

78
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,853
and then simply install Xcode from there.

79
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,580
I already do have it installed,

80
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,813
you can easily install it from there.

81
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,590
Once you did install Xcode, you got all these prerequisites

82
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,360
and we're now ready to install Flutter.

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,060
And for this you should find a download button here

84
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,350
on this page.

85
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,390
And of course the exact version you are seeing here

86
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,100
will differ over time,

87
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,200
but what I teach in this course will still apply no worries.

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,550
So you can then simply just download

89
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,420
this Flutter macOS bundle here, this zip file,

90
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,220
and this can take quite a while since it is quite big.

91
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,120
And once you did download it,

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,100
you can extract it and then continue with the next steps.

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,240
We'll do this together, but for this I'll first of all wait

94
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,393
until the download finished for me here.

95
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,000
Now, the download did finish for me,

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,240
and I am extracting this zip file now,

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,230
which contains the Flutter SDK,

98
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,810
that's what we downloaded here.

99
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,020
And that in turn also already includes

100
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,010
the Flutter framework then, and once that finished,

101
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,490
you have a folder that looks something

102
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,193
like this from inside.

103
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,830
Now that is Flutter downloaded on your system,

104
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,593
but how are we using this downloaded code now?

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,530
Well, that's where the next steps come into play.

106
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,160
We did unzip the file already, so that worked,

107
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,700
but now we wanna also move it to a desired location

108
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,960
where Flutter this SDK should permanently be stored

109
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,363
on our system, if you didn't do that already.

110
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,570
Now, in my case here,

111
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,750
I did create a SDKs folder in some global development folder

112
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,430
which I have on my system

113
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,973
and in there all at a Flutter folder.

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,220
Now I will move all the files and folders

115
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,730
in this extracted folder into this Flutter folder.

116
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,130
Very important, I'm also moving some hidden files here.

117
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,190
So you might wanna make sure that you can see hidden files

118
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,570
before you move everything.

119
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,980
On Mac you can show and hide hidden files

120
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,600
by pressing command + shift + .

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,520
If you hit that

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,350
you can toggle the visibility of hidden files,

123
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,280
and you wanna make sure they're visible

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,163
before you move your content.

125
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,840
Now, I got these Flutter code files

126
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,420
in a global place on my system,

127
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,080
and now next we need to update our so-called path,

128
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,970
which is important to ensure

129
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,970
that we can use a Flutter command in our system terminal

130
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,520
to then create projects or build apps,

131
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,510
however, we'll not add the path like this,

132
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,900
but instead we'll update it such that we don't need

133
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,060
to ever do that again.

134
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,900
Like this you would have to repeat it

135
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,660
every time you restart your system basically,

136
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,550
and there is a better approach.

137
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,060
So we will jump to update your path

138
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,963
and follow the steps shown here.

139
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,610
Now here you can see that we first of all need

140
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,610
to locate a global configuration file called .bashprofile

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,720
or .bashrc or on newer macOS systems .zshrc.

142
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,630
So here I'm in my root user folder.

143
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,610
And in there I've got a bunch of configuration files

144
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,513
and I also got this zshrc file here.

145
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,873
Now I will open that with my standard text editor.

146
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,050
And in there I added this line here.

147
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,870
That's also the line you find here in the end.

148
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,870
This line, that is what you wanna add in your .zshrc file.

149
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,590
Here I added it at the very top,

150
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,000
and you'll just wanna make sure that you in the end,

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,220
do add the path to the bin folder

152
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,743
in that global Flutter folder you created before.

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,420
You can easily get that path

154
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,070
by going to that Flutter folder and then to the bin folder

155
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,143
and right clicking on that bin folder and click get info.

156
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,190
Then you get this info window here

157
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,190
and you can copy this path here including users and Flutter.

158
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,553
And use this path here in front of bin.

159
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,133
Just make sure that you add slash bin at the end.

160
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,930
Once you did that you can close this config file.

161
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,260
Of course, make sure that you did save it.

162
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,590
And you can now open up your regular system terminal.

163
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,163
So the default terminal app which is installed on every Mac.

164
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,159
Here, I opened it on my system I'm using the dark mode,

165
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,270
later in the course,

166
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,060
I'm also occasionally using the light mode,

167
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,050
but here it's the dark mode.

168
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,630
And now in there, you should be able to run Flutter.

169
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,700
Now, if you run this,

170
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,870
you should get a list of the available commands.

171
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,960
If you get any other error like command not found,

172
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,470
then you need to double check

173
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,000
that you did set up your path correctly.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,626
Maybe also try restarting your system

175
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:10,480
after updating the path.

176
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,000
If you did set up everything correctly,

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,130
then you should be able to see these commands here

178
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,330
when you run Flutter in your terminal.

179
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,083
And that proves that you did successfully install Flutter.

180
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,990
Now, once Flutter was installed,

181
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,500
we can continue with setting up everything

182
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,850
we need to set up to build iOS and Android apps.

183
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,830
For this we've got the platform set up a point here

184
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,913
where we have the iOS set up and the Android setup.

185
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,320
Now regarding the iOS setup,

186
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,610
you need to install Xcode and we already did that,

187
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,230
so this should be done.

188
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,880
But now you need to run these two commands

189
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,543
in your terminal after installing Xcode.

190
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,313
So just copy these commands and then in your terminal,

191
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,000
where we tested Flutter before,

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,800
simply copy in these commands hit enter,

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,870
and you might be prompted

194
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,430
to enter your system password here.

195
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,490
So the password with which you also log into the system,

196
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,500
and then eventually this should finish.

197
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,880
You might see more output here

198
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,710
and it might take a bit longer

199
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,770
because I already did run these commands in the past

200
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,270
for you it might now go through certain setup steps,

201
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,223
but ultimately these commands should finish successfully.

202
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,290
You also might need to accept the Xcode license agreement

203
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,570
for that you can either open Xcode

204
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,400
and you should be prompted there.

205
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,190
Or you run this command here in the terminal as well.

206
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,840
And then you see the license agreement

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,970
and you can hit space a couple of times

208
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,950
to jump to the end of that agreement.

209
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,200
It is quite long.

210
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,290
And then at the very end, you wanna type in agree

211
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,050
because you have to agree in the end.

212
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,590
And once you typed agree, you can hit enter

213
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,623
and you're done with that as well.

214
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,790
Now we are ready to build iOS apps with Flutter

215
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,950
and most importantly,

216
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,290
we can also set up an iOS simulator now.

217
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,940
We can start an iOS simulator

218
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,200
on which we will be able to preview our Flutter app.

219
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,890
And you can start such a simulator,

220
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,370
which is basically an iPhone emulator running

221
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,153
on your machine by running this command.

222
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,420
So here I'm running open -a Simulator.

223
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,540
And now what this does is it opens this iPhone simulator

224
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,270
on your system, on your Mac here.

225
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,990
So it's a virtual iPhone,

226
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,310
which you can use for testing your application

227
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,180
so that you don't constantly have

228
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,490
to send it to a real iPhone device.

229
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,190
You can do that as well

230
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,860
and I will show you how to test your application

231
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,450
on a real device as well throughout the course,

232
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,560
but for development, it's much easier

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,090
if you use such a virtual device

234
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,630
since well, it's much quicker

235
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,810
than plugging in your real device

236
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,913
and sending the app over the wire.

237
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,150
Now starting this simulator can take a couple of seconds.

238
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,723
So let's simply wait for that to finish here.

239
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,920
And here we go, it did now start up successfully.

240
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,510
Now for the moment we don't need it,

241
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,540
but we will use it from the next lecture

242
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,230
on to run our Flutter apps on emulators like this.

243
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,780
And I'm saying like this, because of course iOS

244
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,590
is not the only platform we can build for,

245
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,360
Flutter also supports Android.

246
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,440
So now that we did set up this iOS emulator,

247
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,050
before we create any Flutter app,

248
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,510
we will set up an Android emulator

249
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,920
and I will ignore this part about real iOS devices for now,

250
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,760
because we will come back to that later.

251
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,253
So for the moment, I'll just jump ahead to Android setup.

252
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,360
Now for building apps for Android,

253
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,660
we need to install Android studio,

254
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,520
which is basically the equivalent to Xcode.

255
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,620
So for this, we can follow this link

256
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,770
to be taken to the official Android Studio page.

257
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,250
And on this page here,

258
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,263
we can then download Android Studio.

259
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,040
And I guess agree to these terms here

260
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,110
and then download Android Studio onto our system.

261
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,030
It's also a rather big file,

262
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,140
so it can take a couple of seconds

263
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,503
or minutes until this is finished.

264
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,980
So now the download finished,

265
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,720
and if we open this, we'll get an installer,

266
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,420
which we can now use to install Android studio.

267
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,940
So here it's opening this downloaded file for me

268
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,690
and here's the installer

269
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,170
and of course this being macOS the installation process

270
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,820
is all about dragging Android studio app

271
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,713
into the applications folder.

272
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,930
And this will now copy over that tool into applications

273
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,100
and once that is finished

274
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,883
you can of course start Android Studio.

275
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,020
Now, as a side note,

276
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,450
you can close the Android Studio page now,

277
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,390
and just as we won't use Xcode for writing code,

278
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,310
we also won't use Android Studio,

279
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,450
though you could use Android Studio for Flutter development,

280
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,570
because since Flutter is by Google

281
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,740
and Android Studio is by Google

282
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,370
they do have built in support for Flutter,

283
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,080
but I will show you a different IDE, which is free to use,

284
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,720
which in my opinion is a little bit more lightweight

285
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,540
and foster and simply better for Flutter development

286
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,910
and we'll set up and use stats tool in the next lecture.

287
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,640
So for the moment we won't use Android Studio

288
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,650
for anything else than being able

289
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,763
to build Android apps with help of Flutter.

290
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,770
Now, in order to be able to do that though,

291
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,640
after installing Android Studio,

292
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,500
you should start this Android Studio app,

293
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,663
which you just downloaded and installed.

294
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,220
And if you just installed Android Studio for the first time,

295
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,523
you should get this setup wizard.

296
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,050
Now let's walk through that wizard together.

297
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,760
Here I wanna choose custom,

298
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,470
those standards should also be fine,

299
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,430
but I wanna be able to fully customize my setup

300
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,920
and I'll keep this default path here

301
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,080
because the default path should be fine.

302
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,570
And then you can choose a theme

303
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,930
which doesn't matter too much

304
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,850
since we won't develop in Android Studio anyways,

305
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,563
but I'll go for the dark theme.

306
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,960
And then very important make sure

307
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,870
that you install Android SDK here

308
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,250
and then also at least one Android API.

309
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,800
It should by default give you the latest version,

310
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,010
which in my case is 30 here.

311
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,320
So you wanna install that as well.

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,210
If you can also select is Intel Haxm tool here.

313
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,430
In my case, it is already installed,

314
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,090
that's why I can't selected,

315
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,480
but if you can select it, make sure you do,

316
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,990
if you can't, it's no problem,

317
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,470
but it can help with running the emulator

318
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,760
and make sure you have

319
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,480
this Android virtual device thing selected

320
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,803
because that's what we need to spin up emulators later.

321
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,000
Now I'll then click next and then finish

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,430
and this will now download

323
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,180
and install all the different tools and SDKs,

324
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,160
which Android studio will need under the hood

325
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,050
to build Android apps

326
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,710
and Flutter will then later leverage Android Studio

327
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,533
for building your Flutter code as Android apps.

328
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,750
So let's wait for this to finish

329
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,853
and as everything this can take a couple of minutes.

330
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,540
So now the setup finished for me

331
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,760
and in case you didn't get that wizard,

332
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,760
or you wanna change something after the set up,

333
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,680
you can always go to this SDK manager here

334
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,520
and open that through that starting menu for example,

335
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,300
you can also open it from inside Android Studio

336
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,210
and here you can also install missing pieces.

337
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,050
You can select different Android versions, select them here,

338
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,280
and if you then click, okay, that will be installed.

339
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,640
Now we don't need it though,

340
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,750
because we went through that setup.

341
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,250
And therefore I will go to the AVD manager

342
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,670
by clicking on configure AVD manager.

343
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,210
That is the manager that allows us to create emulators,

344
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,370
which we can then launch to test our app on.

345
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,170
What we also did for iOS,

346
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,420
there we didn't need to create it here we do,

347
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,660
so I will just go there

348
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,200
and you might already have some virtual devices,

349
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,890
some emulators here.

350
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,740
If you don't, you can click on create virtual device

351
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,450
and then create a new device a new virtual emulator

352
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,360
and well, it's up to you

353
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,440
what you wanna pick I'll pick a pixel free here.

354
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,170
You wanna check that PlayStore is selected here.

355
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,230
This unlocks some extra capabilities

356
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,340
that can be helpful later on like using Google Maps is on.

357
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,483
So I'll make sure that this is selected, click next,

358
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,890
and then choose my Android version

359
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,660
that I wanna install there.

360
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,300
And here I actually wanna use Android 11

361
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,250
so I will download that latest version,

362
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,770
which is missing in my case, R I clicked on download

363
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,390
and I will download this system image now,

364
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,763
which again can take a couple of minutes.

365
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,530
And now that that finished,

366
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,450
I can actually select this system image

367
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,430
to get that latest Android version, click next,

368
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,990
leave these defaults click finish.

369
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,310
And this will now create a new virtual device.

370
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,870
And once this was created,

371
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,340
we can click on this play button here

372
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,330
to launch this emulator,

373
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,330
just as we before launched this iOS device emulator.

374
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,323
Now we're launching an Android emulator.

375
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,560
Now this as everything you're can take a couple of seconds

376
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,473
or minutes until it's ready,

377
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,460
but eventually it should be starting up here

378
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
and you can always change the size

379
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,520
just as I did it for the iOS emulators.

380
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,550
And it will now boot up.

381
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,400
Here we go.

382
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,233
The operating system is starting up on this virtual device.

383
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,130
And now once this did finish starting up,

384
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,080
we can also run Flutter apps on this virtual device

385
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,180
to preview them there.

386
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,470
But that's what we're going to do over,

387
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,680
well, the entire course,

388
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,400
but specifically also in the next lecture,

389
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,370
when we are going to create our first Flutter project

390
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,120
and dive into some Flutter code,

391
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,810
because now we did install Flutter,

392
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,600
and the tools we need to build cross-platform mobile apps

393
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,530
on macOS and the tools we need to tested those apps.

394
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,830
Now to finish up this set up process now

395
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,730
I wanna validate everything was installed successfully.

396
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,660
And to validate this, you can go back to your terminal

397
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,060
and there run Flutter doctor,

398
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,450
which is a command that analyzes your setup and shows you

399
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,850
any potential central problems you might be facing.

400
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,110
And if I run this it's first of all,

401
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,993
downloading some extra tools that this command needs,

402
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,100
but once that's done it will analyze my setup

403
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,540
and then show me a little output with a summary of my setup

404
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,530
and any potential problems I might be facing.

405
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,960
And indeed here I am facing some problems.

406
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,150
I do have Flutter installed,

407
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,740
but for Android, I need to accept some licenses.

408
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,650
And for Xcode you see that some tool

409
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,020
which Xcode uses under the hood CocoaPods is out of date

410
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,760
and they might wanna update it.

411
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,120
Now, conveniently this command Flutter doctor

412
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,730
typically also shows as a ways of solving these problems.

413
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,340
So for example, regarding the Android licenses,

414
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,250
we should now run this command,

415
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,120
Flutter doctor --android-licenses.

416
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,000
So that's what I'll do.

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,070
I'll copy that down there and run this command.

418
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,610
If you should be getting an error when trying to run this,

419
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,050
like I do here with this XML schema,

420
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,480
then the workaround is quite simple.

421
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,580
You can again go back to Android Studio

422
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,450
and there open the SDK manager,

423
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,333
which we used before as well.

424
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,870
And here under appearance and behavior,

425
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,640
go to system settings, and then Android SDK,

426
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,820
and here go to SDK tools

427
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,083
and choose the Android SDK command line tools,

428
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,470
then click, okay

429
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,280
and this will now download this extra utility

430
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,210
onto our system and install it.

431
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,923
So let's wait for this to finish.

432
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,350
And once this finished click finish here,

433
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,110
close your terminal and then restart it

434
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,110
and now again run Flutter doctor --android-licenses.

435
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,770
And now this should succeed

436
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,440
and it does now accept all those Android licenses.

437
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,330
Now, if I run Flutter doctor again,

438
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,120
what should happen is that now this time

439
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,340
I get no more problems related to Android.

440
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,390
Regarding Xcode I do

441
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,050
and here I might wanna update my CocoaPods version,

442
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,633
and we can do that by following these instructions here.

443
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,260
So you can just open that link in a browser

444
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,360
and you should be taken to this page

445
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,280
and here you wanna run this command in your terminal now

446
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,820
to install the latest version of this CocoaPods tool,

447
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,370
which Xcode uses under the hood.

448
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,720
So I'll just do that quickly.

449
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,910
You might be prompted for your user password.

450
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,210
So the password which you use for logging into your system,

451
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,440
and I did enter this here and now this will be installed.

452
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,053
Let's wait for this installation to finish.

453
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,660
Here we go.

454
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,240
It finished for me.

455
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,690
And now if I run Flutter doctor again,

456
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm not getting any issues anymore.

457
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,550
Now you might still get issues or warnings here.

458
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,440
And for example, VS Code is a tool I have installed,

459
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,310
you probably don't.

460
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,950
But if Android Flutter and Xcode is fine for you,

461
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,300
then you should be good.

462
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,740
Android Studio should also be good, then you should be good.

463
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,630
If you got no connected device here that's fine

464
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,010
because you might not have an emulator

465
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,390
up and running anymore.

466
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,880
You can always restart them as shown to you

467
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,240
in the previous minutes.

468
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,000
And then as soon as you do have an emulator up and running,

469
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,920
this should be checked again.

470
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,860
And therefore you should be fine

471
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,550
if you have no problems related

472
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,240
to Android, Xcode or Flutter itself.

473
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,580
If you do face problems here,

474
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,750
you very often will find the solution right here

475
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,350
in that output as you just saw for the steps before.

476
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,863
So definitely then try the solutions proposed there.

477
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,910
And therefore let's now move on to the next lecture

478
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,140
where we will now set up our development environment,

479
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,320
create a first Flutter app,

480
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,630
and you will see how you can then run this Flutter app

481
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,890
on an emulator

482
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,580
and how you can even change the code a little bit

483
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,960
to then see how code changes are reflected

484
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,793
on the running emulator.
