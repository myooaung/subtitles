1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,840
In the first app, you already saw it and throughout this course, you will see it, Flutter by default embraces

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,790
the material design system, the material design language. Material design looks like this as an example.

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,570
and it's a design system created and heavily used by Google.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,600
Now it's not Google's style for everyone though, it it's highly customizable and works on iOS devices

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,170
too, so you can also use it in your iOS apps

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,280
and whilst material design is built into Flutter, you also find Apple styled widgets in the Flutter

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,760
framework which you can use

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
and in this course, I will show you both.

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,370
I will show you how to build apps that look like the typical material design application,

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,680
I will show you how to set up your own look,

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,190
so neither material design, not iOS style

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:54,370
and I will also show you how you can get that iOS look with the so-called Cupertino widgets which

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,900
Flutter also offers.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,180
So here again, Flutter gives you full flexibility regarding how your app should look like

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,070
and in this course, I'll cover all the different options and show you how you build different kinds of

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,840
apps. For the majority,

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,850
I'll use the built-in material design widgets but you will learn how you could deviate from this as

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,520
well.
