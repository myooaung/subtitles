00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.270
Now that we added our theme here,

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.440
why don't we also add a custom font?

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.700
Because right now, we always use the system default font which is okay but in a lot of applications, you

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.360
of course want to bring your own text styles, your own fonts and adding custom fonts is very easy

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.100
in Flutter apps.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.020
First of all, you need to create a new folder in your project folder, so not in the lib folder but simply

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.330
in your main project folder.

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.430
You can name that folder whatever you want,

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.560
typically you name it something like assets.
