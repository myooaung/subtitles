00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,566
- [Maximilian] In this lecture,

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:06,733
we'll install Flutter on a Windows machine

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:10,400
and we'll set up Windows and
install all the tools we need

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,433
to develop Flutter apps on Windows.

5
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:16,265
If you are not following along on Windows,

6
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,633
you can therefore of course,

7
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:20,900
skip this lecture and
the next lecture as well,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,266
because in the next lecture,

9
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,066
we'll set up the
environment for writing code

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,300
with for Flutter on Windows.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,900
Now the best way to start
installing Flutter and everything

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,600
we need is to go to Flutter.dev,

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,866
which is the official website
of the Flutter project.

14
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:40,866
And there you can go to
docs and then click on,

15
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,533
get started and find instructions

16
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,733
for different operating systems.

17
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,800
And here we are, of course,
interested in Windows.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,433
Now the official docs are a
great place to also dive in

19
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,866
and get written instructions

20
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:59,966
in case you should get
stuck at some point,

21
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:03,266
we will go through all the
important steps to gather here,

22
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:06,500
but definitely also dive
into this stocks here

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
if you are facing any problems

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,300
or if you may be just also

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,100
wanna get some written instructions,

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,633
in addition to this video,

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,000
Now it all starts with the
system requirements here.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,133
So you need to meet these requirements

29
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:24,100
if you wanna use Flutter,
there's no way around that.

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,066
Especially the Git requirement
might not be met yet,

31
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:31,500
but Git is an extra tool
which you normally use

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
for controlling source code

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,666
and saving source code snapshots,

34
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,300
which is getting used by
Flutter under the hood,

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,100
and which we therefore need to install

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,633
before we can install and use Flutter.

37
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:48,366
You can just follow this
link here to download

38
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:53,366
an installer for Windows,
so for Git for Windows.

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
And I'll do that here,
download this installer.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,433
And then once this download finished,

41
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,733
we can simply walk through that installer

42
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,000
and we'll do that
together in just a second.

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,199
Here we go.

44
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,700
And basically just keep the defaults here.

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,433
So I'll keep all these defaults,

46
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,566
which will make working
with Flutter easier

47
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,266
since everything will just work

48
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:21,333
if you use the defaults and you wanna keep

49
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,800
all the defaults here
on this page as well.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,433
Continue, you can keep
this default here as well

51
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,000
if you want to.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,133
Click next, click next here as well.

53
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,533
And now very important
on this screen here,

54
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,900
where it's about adjusting
your path environment

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,033
we find on the Flutter page,

56
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:46,000
that we should ensure that we can use Git

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
from the Windows Command Prompt

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,566
and therefore this middle
option should be checked here.

59
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,400
It's the default typically,
it's recommended here

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,066
and we should make sure that
we use this option here.

61
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,800
And then click next.

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,433
We can leave that as well,

63
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:05,800
leave all these defaults here
and just click through all

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
these options here and then
click install at the end.

65
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,366
And this will now install this git tool

66
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,500
which we could use for
managing our source code

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,400
and for creating snapshots,

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,633
you can explore a standalone
courses and talks on that,

69
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,433
but that's not a must do,

70
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:28,033
but Flutter we'll use
this tool under the hood

71
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,066
and therefore we need to know install it.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,600
So let's wait for this
installation to finish here.

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Once this did finish,

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,900
I'm not going to read the
release notes, but click finish.

75
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,300
And now we can move on
to installing Flutter.

76
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
For this we can download it here.

77
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,166
And of course the exact
version you are seeing here

78
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,200
when you are following along

79
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,533
will very likely be a different one than

80
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,700
I see here,

81
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,033
but you will still learn
Flutter in the correct way

82
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,400
through out this course no worries.

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,466
So here I'll just download Flutter

84
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,166
and that's a around big download.

85
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,400
So it can take a while
until it's finished.

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,900
And once this is finished, we
will extract that Zip file,

87
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,500
which is downloaded here

88
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,066
and we can see that in step two here,

89
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,666
we can place that Flutter folder,

90
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,399
which we'll get by
extracting that Zip file

91
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,833
in any desired installation
location on our system.

92
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:29,200
And typically you wanna use
some global location there are

93
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,200
somewhere on your root drive.

94
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,900
However, not in C program
files, as you see here,

95
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,233
and also not in any other folder

96
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,833
that might have restricted access.

97
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,133
For example, not the system 32 folder,

98
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:48,566
but instead some root folder
where your Windows user

99
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:53,233
has full unrestricted
read and write access.

100
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,100
So for example,

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,800
the documents folder and your
user folder, as you see here,

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,033
but you can use any root folder.

103
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,833
So the download finished for
me here and hence all extract

104
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,966
that file here, that Zip file.

105
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,800
And in there you find this Flutter folder,

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,833
I'll now move that Flutter
folders to some our destination

107
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,833
on my system to be precise
here, I'm in my a user folder.

108
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,233
And in there I'm going
to create a new folder.

109
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,600
I do apologize for this being German here,

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,733
but I'll just create a new folder,

111
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,566
which I'll name development.

112
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,900
And in that development folder,

113
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,566
I'll create a new sub folder,

114
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:42,266
which I'll name SDKs, and
then in this SDKs folder,

115
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,400
which is my root user folder

116
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,900
and then in that development folder there,

117
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,966
I'll direct that Flutter folder into.

118
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:54,166
So this extracted Flutter folder
goes into that SDKs folder

119
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,900
in my development folder,
in my user folder.

120
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,400
And you should store your Flutter STK,

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,566
this extracted Flutter folder

122
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,700
in some global location like this,

123
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,533
so that you can easily
work with it from anywhere

124
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,300
on your system later on,

125
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,466
because that's what
we'll need to do there.

126
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,300
Now, since this is big,

127
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,733
this can take a couple of
seconds if you do it like this,

128
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,800
and I'll we'll therefore be back ones this

129
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,433
has been copied over.

130
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,566
Now moving that folder
finished for me here.

131
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:31,166
And that means that now we did
download and install Flutter,

132
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,466
but Flutter is not a
tool that we then opened

133
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,200
by double clicking on it

134
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,833
instead it is a tool
which we typically invoke

135
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,366
through the command prompt,

136
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,900
which is installed on every Windows system

137
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,733
and therefore what

138
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:48,400
we need to do next is we
need to update our path,

139
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,366
which means that we make
this Flutter command,

140
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:56,500
this Flutter tool that we
installed globally available

141
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,533
inside of the command prompt,
no matter where on our system,

142
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,066
we then execute this.

143
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,500
And this will be super important.

144
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,733
Now for that what we have to do is

145
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,533
we have to add it to our
environment variables.

146
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:14,600
For this, you can type env here
into this quick-start area.

147
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,900
And for me again, it's German,

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,300
but this is added our
environment variables.

149
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,900
And here you wanna click on user variables

150
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,500
or environment variables here.

151
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,900
And then these are some global variables,

152
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,400
which in the end all is the control,

153
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,433
which commands can be invoked

154
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:34,100
from inside your command prompt.

155
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,733
And there you should have a path variable.

156
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,700
If you don't have it, you can create it

157
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,133
but very often you will have one already.

158
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:45,033
And then you should add
it to this path variable

159
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,666
by clicking on edit.

160
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,200
And here you can now add new entries

161
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,866
to this environment variable.

162
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:55,066
And here what you wanna do is you want

163
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:58,466
to add an entry that points
at this Flutter folder,

164
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:02,666
which we moved into a global
destination on our system.

165
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,366
So for this here and
back in the STKs folder,

166
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,033
I'll go into that Flutter folder

167
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,300
and they're into the bin folder.

168
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,933
And then I click in here to
grab this path to the bin folder

169
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,600
on my system, this entire path

170
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,266
that's what I need here.

171
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,300
And in there, we have that
Flutter and that dart command,

172
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
and these are the commands
which we wanna invoke

173
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,366
from the Command-Line later

174
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,266
and therefore we need to add the path

175
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:32,033
to this tools to our path
environment variable.

176
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:35,232
So here, where I'm editing
this path environment variable,

177
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:38,366
I'll add a new entry to it and just paste

178
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:40,299
in this path I selected

179
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,232
so that it's part of this
path environment variable

180
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,800
and then we can click OK

181
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,100
And now this was added here

182
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,666
and we can now click OK again,
close all these settings,

183
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,633
and now you should be able
to invoke the Flutter command

184
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:58,266
from inside your command prompt.

185
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,966
And that's what we'll try it right away.

186
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,966
I'll open my default command prompt.

187
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,200
You can find it by simply typing command

188
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,900
into your quick start menu.

189
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,700
Use this command prompt here

190
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,733
and then here in this command prompt,

191
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,900
you can type Flutter like that.

192
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:19,066
And this should then work.

193
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,266
It should show you a list
of available commands

194
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:25,366
in the end here which it does for me,

195
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,366
it should not show any error.

196
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,066
And that proves that we
did successfully add it

197
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,566
as an environment variable.

198
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,966
Now in here, what you can do is

199
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,700
you can run Flutter doctor,

200
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,466
which is a little analysis command,

201
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:42,733
which will analyze your
system and see if it's ready

202
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:45,366
to build Flutter apps.

203
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,600
And this will therefore for first of all,

204
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,300
download some extra software
and then run this check.

205
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,166
And right now it will probably
fail because for example,

206
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:59,133
we have not set up everything
for Android development yet,

207
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,766
You might

208
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:05,466
also see
a message regarding Visual Studio here and here.

209
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:11,100
It's important to note that
this would only be required if you plan to build

210
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,766
desktop applications for Windows.

211
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,700
And since this is not the focus of this course,

212
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,233
you don't need to install Visual Studio.

213
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,633
It's totally fine to have this red

214
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
cross here in your "flutter doctor"

215
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,933
output for this visual Studio option,

216
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,433
because
we won't work with Visual Studio and we won't

217
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:39,366
build desktop
apps with Flutter in this course, by the way.

218
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:43,400
Visual
Studio here should also not be confused with

219
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,900
Visual Studio
Code, which is the code editor we'll soon install.

220
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:51,666
We definitely
will install Visual Studio Code, but we

221
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:56,200
don't need
Visual Studio, so we'll ignore Visual Studio.

222
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,900
But we do need the Android toolchain on our system.

223
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:04,233
We want to be able to build our Flutter apps for

224
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:08,166
Android and therefore
that's the next thing we'll proceed with.

225
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:09,700
we have not set up everything
for Android development yet,

226
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,333
and that's important because
that will be the next step.

227
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,733
We can use Flutter as a tool

228
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,133
to build cross-platform applications,

229
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:21,966
but we actually need
to install extra tools,

230
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,633
which will be used by
Flutter under the hood

231
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:28,833
to then really build for iOS or Android.

232
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,400
And that's always important
on Windows you unfortunately,

233
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,333
can't build for iOS.

234
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,400
That's a restriction by Apple,

235
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,533
not by Flutter.

236
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,233
You can't build iOS apps on Windows

237
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,066
you can only build Android apps there.

238
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:46,833
You need a Mac to build iOS
apps there it is what it is,

239
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,933
but we can build Android apps

240
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,133
by going for the Android setup,

241
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,833
which we also find here
in the official docs.

242
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,300
And what we need to do
here in the Android set up

243
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,666
is we need to install Android Studio,

244
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,200
which is the official
development environment

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,133
by Google for building
Android applications.

246
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:08,966
So for that

247
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,333
we can follow this link

248
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,300
and open the Android studio website here,

249
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,233
then simply download Android Studio.

250
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,766
Accept the terms here, I guess,

251
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,266
and then start this download,

252
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,600
which is also big and therefore can

253
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,933
take a couple of seconds or minutes.

254
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,333
Now I'll be back once
this download finished

255
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,233
so that we can then walk
through this installer,

256
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,800
which we'll get there together.

257
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,033
So here we go, download finished.

258
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:40,533
I'll now start this installer
that we downloaded here

259
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,200
to install Android studio.

260
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,433
And here we can now walk through
that installation wizard,

261
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,533
which for some reason is
a bit blurry for me here,

262
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,333
but anyways,

263
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,500
we can walk through it and basically keep

264
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,400
all these default settings,

265
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,633
especially also make
sure you're installing

266
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,700
the Android virtual device here.

267
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,400
We'll need dev for
running Emulators later,

268
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,833
which are virtual Android
phones on our computer

269
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,633
to test and review our Flutter apps.

270
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:13,066
So we definitely want that click next,

271
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,000
keep that default location

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,733
if there is any way of doing that.

273
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:20,000
So unless you really have to
install it somewhere else,

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,133
don't install it somewhere else.

275
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,933
Instead, keep that default

276
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,033
it will make working with
Android so much easier

277
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,200
because everything will just work

278
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,633
and Flutter we'll find Android studio

279
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,900
without issues and so on.

280
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,900
So keep that default possible,
click next and install.

281
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:44,433
And this will now install
Android Studio onto our system.

282
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:48,800
So let's wait for this installation
process to finish here.

283
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,633
And once this is finished, we
can also start it immediately.

284
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:57,900
So keep that checkbox checked
here and start Android studio

285
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,100
like this.

286
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,333
And by default,

287
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,133
when you started for the first time,

288
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:08,133
you should get this wizard
here, this setup wizard.

289
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,733
And we'll definitely go
through that wizard here

290
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,733
because we need certain settings

291
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,566
and tools to be set up

292
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,733
and we can set them up
through that wizard.

293
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,366
So here I'll choose custom

294
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:23,266
so that I can customize everything.

295
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:26,500
And the first thing I'll do
is I'll keep that default path

296
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,833
here for this Java Development Kit,

297
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,500
which is required under the hood.

298
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,500
And as always try to
keep that default path,

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,033
if double click next,

300
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:40,900
then you can chose the
theme of the editor.

301
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,633
It's not too important because
I won't use Android studio

302
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,000
for writing code here anyways,

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,700
we just use it under
the hood or a Flutter.

304
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,933
We'll use it under the hood
for building our Android apps,

305
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,766
but still I'll choose that
dark mode here, click next.

306
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:59,233
And then here very important,

307
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,600
make sure you do install
an Android version year.

308
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,533
In my case,

309
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll install API 30 that you
do install the Android SDK

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,666
and that you do install the
Android virtual device here.

311
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,800
And if you have the option
also install into HAXM.

312
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,633
Now you might not be able to select this

313
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,966
and that's fine as well.

314
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,866
You don't need it, but
if you can install it

315
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:26,700
definitely do because this

316
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,800
will speed up this virtual Emulator later

317
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,733
and simply make it run a bit smoother.

318
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,066
So basically here,

319
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:38,066
you wanna check all these
options and click next.

320
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:42,733
Then here you can leave these
defaults for allocating memory

321
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,900
to the Emulator.

322
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,300
So to this virtual Android device,

323
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,400
which we will soon run on our system,

324
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,433
click next and click finish,

325
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,733
and the this will now download
and install more tools

326
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:55,733
under the hood.

327
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,633
So therefore again,

328
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,233
this can take a couple
of minutes to finish

329
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,266
and I'll be back once it did finish.

330
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:07,366
No set up this finished for me here.

331
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,533
So I'll finish this here
and now what we can do

332
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:14,733
on this opening or this welcome
screen here is first of all,

333
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,833
we can go to the STK Manager

334
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,200
by clicking on configure STK Manager.

335
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,100
And there you can install
any missing pieces

336
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
that you might still need
though, with that default setup,

337
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,900
we chosen the wizard we should be fine.

338
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,633
The only thing I do recommend here

339
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,100
is that you go to SDK tools

340
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,366
and you choose the Android
SDK Command-Line Tools here.

341
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:40,066
You should install those as well since

342
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:45,066
that can actually a wide some
unnecessary errors later,

343
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,933
but that should be all you
need to install right now.

344
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,700
So I'll choose that here
and click, OK, again,

345
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,033
click here and accept the
license and click next.

346
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:58,900
And this will now again,

347
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,900
download and install this
extra utility software,

348
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,733
which we need.

349
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,566
So let's wait for this to finish.

350
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,133
And once this did finish,
we can click finish.

351
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,566
And then again, on this welcome screen,

352
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:16,400
click on configure AVD
Manager, by the way,

353
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,465
you should get this welcome screen

354
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,566
whenever you start Android studio.

355
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,333
So that's how you can get back there

356
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,300
if you don't see it.

357
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,233
And then there click on
configure AVD Manager,

358
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:31,033
that is where you can
manage the virtual devices.

359
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,933
So the virtual Android Emulators,

360
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:36,033
you can run on your system.

361
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:40,766
And these are basically virtual
Android phones or tablets,

362
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,033
which you can run on your computer

363
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,933
to test Android apps on them,

364
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,333
so that you don't need a real
Android phone for testing

365
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,633
and also so that

366
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:54,166
you can easily configure
different virtual phones

367
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,100
on which you can test your Android apps.

368
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,133
So that's a very useful tool

369
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:01,033
which we'll use during
development to preview

370
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,100
our Flutter app on Android.

371
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:07,400
Now you might have a default
phone already, if not,

372
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,066
you can click on create virtual device

373
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:13,133
and choose any device blueprint you want.

374
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,833
Like the pixel free here.

375
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,666
That's what I'll use click on next.

376
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,600
And then choose an Android version

377
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
you wanna install there

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,433
and I'll use the latest
stable version at the moment

379
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,766
and click download here to install

380
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:32,833
that well operating
system for this Emulator,

381
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,233
which again can take a short while

382
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,633
since it's big.

383
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,600
So let's wait for this to finish.

384
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,233
Here we go.

385
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,900
Now that's finished and now

386
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,966
I can choose this Android version,

387
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,866
click next and then finish
setting up this blueprint.

388
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,233
And now I can start this phone by clicking

389
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,833
on this play button here to launch

390
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,566
this virtual Android device and will need

391
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:02,600
such a virtual Android
device to simply preview

392
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,200
and test the Flutter app that
we're building on Android.

393
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,166
Now this can take a while
until this started up,

394
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,000
but for the moment,

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,900
we can already go back
to the official docs

396
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
and continue here.

397
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,533
By the way,

398
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,800
we can also connect a real Android device

399
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,833
to our system

400
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,833
and run our Flutter app on that.

401
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,966
But we'll not do that right now instead

402
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,800
we will do that later in the course.

403
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,366
So we'll ignore this set
up your Android device part

404
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:35,733
for now and we did already
set up our Emulator here.

405
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,300
So that should already all be fine

406
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,433
though you can also go through
these written steps again,

407
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:42,400
if you want to.

408
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,766
Now the Emulator is up
and running for me here,

409
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:49,633
and now it's time to go
back to the command prompt

410
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:54,300
and in there run Flutter doctor again,

411
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,900
now that we did set up
Android a bit more and so on,

412
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,300
and this now looks better though

413
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,133
we still got a warning
regarding the Android toolchain

414
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:07,133
and that warning tells us that we need

415
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,066
to accept some extra Android licenses.

416
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:14,166
It also shows us the command
we have to run for that

417
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,033
and that's the convenient
thing about Flutter doctor

418
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,366
it very often shows you fix this

419
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:22,800
you can use if certain
issues are detected,

420
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,400
we can see that we, for example,

421
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,333
get a connected device now though.

422
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,266
So now here I will simply

423
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:35,266
run Flutter doctor --Android - licenses

424
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:40,633
as recommended here and hit enter.

425
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:42,466
And then this will now
automatically accept

426
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:46,533
all those Android
licenses to be precise it,

427
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,500
asks me whether I wanna accept

428
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,066
and I'll type y here for yes,

429
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,100
all the time,

430
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,833
every time I'm prompted to
accept all those licenses.

431
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,300
And now with that finished.

432
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,733
If you did get an error here

433
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,766
make sure you installed

434
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,533
those Android Command-Line
Tools I showed you

435
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,733
a couple of minutes ago
through the SDK Manager

436
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,366
inside of Android Studio.

437
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:17,100
And now by doing that, if we
now run Flutter doctor again,

438
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,066
we now finally should have
a working Android setup.

439
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,000
That looks good.

440
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,566
So we now went through this step here

441
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,233
and we won't continue with Windows setups

442
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:31,133
since we will focus on
building mobile apps

443
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:33,500
with Flutter in this course

444
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,033
and therefore now we installed
Flutter and Android studio,

445
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,066
we've got all these tools set up.

446
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,466
In the next lecture we'll now create

447
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,400
a new Flutter project

448
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,466
and set up our development environment

449
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:49,066
and run this Flutter app on our Emulator.
