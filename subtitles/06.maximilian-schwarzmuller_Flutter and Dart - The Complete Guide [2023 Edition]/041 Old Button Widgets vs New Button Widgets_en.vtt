00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.170
Now, in this course section

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.180
we learned a lot about the basics of Flutter

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.440
and one thing you probably noticed is that if you're using

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.630
a recent version of Flutter to be precise

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.850
a version greater than Flutter 2,

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
you got deprecation warnings for the buttons we used.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.740
And I did talk about that in the lectures

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.000
where I introduced those buttons already.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.400
Now, in this course,

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.210
we are going to work with those buttons a lot.

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.330
And with that, I mean the RaisedButton, FlatButton

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.780
and also the OutlineButton

13
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.000
which is a never button, which you could use

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.660
even though we haven't used it up to this point.

15
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.830
We're going to work with those button widgets a lot

16
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.820
and since this course was recorded prior

17
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.820
to this deprecation, I do use these old buttons in quotes,

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.180
in this course.

19
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.700
Now, if you follow along with this course,

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.150
you probably have the best course experience

21
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.623
and it's easiest to follow along if you stick

22
00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:07.690
to these deprecated buttons to these old buttons

23
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.275
so to say, because those buttons despite being deprecated

24
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:15.210
are being used in a lot of projects all over the world,

25
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.830
you will see them in a lot of our resources

26
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.550
and tutorials as well.

27
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.150
And using them as not wrong, you can use them,

28
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.740
they are here and they will also stick around

29
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.560
for many months to come.

30
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.290
If you're getting annoyed by this deprecation warning here,

31
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.100
in Visual Studio Code, if you you're getting annoyed

32
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.660
by it as strike through effect, you can go to the settings

33
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.990
and disabled that fact there by searching

34
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.970
for deprecated and disabling this show deprecated option.

35
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.280
That's an alternative, you don't have to do that,

36
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.930
but you can do that if you wanna follow along

37
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.003
with those existing buttons.

38
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190
But of course you can also switch,

39
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.250
you can switch to the new equivalents

40
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.838
for these buttons and follow along with these.

41
00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:05.200
That is all the fine and of course, a bit more future-proof.

42
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.940
In the rest of this lecture,

43
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.840
I will therefore show you how you can switch

44
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.341
from the old to the new buttons

45
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.341
especially when you also have some styling on those buttons.

46
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.820
And with that, I'm talking about the RaisedButton,

47
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.230
the FlatButton and the OutlineButton

48
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.300
other buttons like floating action buttons

49
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.430
or IconButtons are not deprecated.

50
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.310
It's these three buttons which are deprecated.

51
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.770
And hence, if you use RaisedButton, FlatButton

52
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.870
or OutlineButton in your code,

53
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.660
and you are using Flutter 2, you might see this strike

54
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.840
through effect here in Visual Studio Code,

55
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.560
which signals that you should not use that button anymore,

56
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.180
though I will come back to this should not use part

57
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.230
in a couple of seconds again.

58
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.430
Now the most important message right away

59
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.970
is that even though you should not use them anymore,

60
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.170
you can absolutely still use them.

61
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.580
If I would run this simple demo app here,

62
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.850
which really just renders these three buttons,

63
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.140
I can still see those three buttons

64
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.560
on the screen and they do work, I can press them,

65
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.280
I got no error, everything works.

66
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.310
I get my log outputs down there

67
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.450
from pressing these buttons.

68
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.750
So I can continue using them

69
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.810
and I don't have to change all of them right now.

70
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.590
I can do this later in the future

71
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.610
and indeed you will still see these old buttons

72
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.170
in quotes get used a lot in other resources

73
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.520
in example apps which you find out there

74
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.540
and in existing code basis of existing projects.

75
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.030
That's another reason why you might not wanna switch

76
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.630
instantly because you will still find a lot of resources

77
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.160
out there which do use these older buttons.

78
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.280
Of course, the alternative to sticking

79
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.180
to these buttons is to migrate to their new equivalents

80
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.420
because these old buttons were deprecated

81
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.570
because there were new button widgets introduced

82
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.520
which you should use instead.

83
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.970
And we're now going to migrate to these newer buttons

84
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.430
step-by-step over the next minutes.

85
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.329
And let's start with the RaisedButton.

86
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.203
The RaisedButton will be replaced by an ElevatedButton.

87
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.360
Now for the moment, we'll have to remove color

88
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.960
and text color because the ElevatedButton

89
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.140
does not support these arguments,

90
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.550
but if we would have a button without any custom colors,

91
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.769
then migrating to this new button is as simple

92
00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.320
as swapping out the name.

93
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.690
Because it's then really just ElevatedButton

94
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.330
instead of RaisedButton.

95
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.770
And if I saved this, this button is still being rendered

96
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.950
and I'm now using this ElevatedButton.

97
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.440
Now, one thing you can already see here is,

98
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.760
of course now that I migrated

99
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.410
or switched to this ElevatedButton,

100
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.350
we automatically have this blue background

101
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.930
and this white text color,

102
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.838
because the ElevatedButton,

103
00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:14.416
behind the scenes automatically picks up

104
00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:19.140
your main theme color set by your application.

105
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.040
And that is blue in this case here.

106
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.260
And therefore we automatically get this styling

107
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.640
which is in-line with our theme

108
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.400
which is one of the advantages of the new buttons,

109
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.030
we don't have to add styles manually,

110
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.510
we do get the base styling

111
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.340
fitting our theme out of the box.

112
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.562
But of course we can also still style them manually

113
00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:46.562
to override the theme color or add other extra stylings.

114
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.790
And that's the biggest difference

115
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.570
between the old and the new buttons.

116
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.440
The old buttons had those extra arguments

117
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.600
which you could set for styling them like the text color

118
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.070
the border side ends on.

119
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.400
The new buttons don't have that.

120
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.920
Instead, the new buttons have a single new style argument

121
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.290
which you can set to then style this button.

122
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.950
And style wants a button style object,

123
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.490
which you construct by instantiating

124
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.230
the button style class.

125
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.180
And it's then this button style class

126
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.060
where you can set all kinds of styles for this button.

127
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.050
And here, for example, you got a background color

128
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.820
and you got a foreground color

129
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.013
and you would use these colors to control the text editor

130
00:06:36.013 --> 00:06:37.730
well background color.

131
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.650
Foreground color sets the text

132
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.130
as you see background color sets to fill color.

133
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.700
So here, if you wanna have a RaisedButton

134
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.930
with a blue background color and the white foreground color,

135
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.170
we could set background color here

136
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.053
but then not to color start blue,

137
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.310
you don't use it like this.

138
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.713
Instead here, you then use material state property all

139
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.170
and then pass colors, stop blue to that.

140
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.370
Might look a bit strange,

141
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.290
but that is how you do then assign a color

142
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.300
to this background color argument here

143
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.260
for this button style object,

144
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.270
which we set as a style for this button.

145
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.509
And for the foreground color it's materials

146
00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:26.740
state property all colors white.

147
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.050
And if we would set this,

148
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.570
then we would have this blue button still.

149
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.360
But if I for example, switch my background

150
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.680
color to orange and saved as

151
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.270
now we have the orange button.

152
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.930
So that's how we then style these new buttons

153
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.578
with this extra style argument

154
00:07:44.578 --> 00:07:48.420
which takes such a button style object.

155
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.190
Now, since assigning styles

156
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.840
like this can be a bit annoying,

157
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.410
especially drilling into the colors like this

158
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.500
can be annoying, there is an alternative way

159
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.410
of deriving this style for this button.

160
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.740
You can use ElevatedButton, but then not instantiated

161
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.020
but instead called a style from method there.

162
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.920
And on this style from method, you then get a couple

163
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.650
of styling arguments like primary,

164
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.290
and you can then directly the set primary

165
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.790
to a color like colors blue.

166
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.560
And this will then affect all the parts of the button

167
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.100
that make up this button.

168
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.720
So for the ElevatedButton,

169
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.670
that button has a background color

170
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.680
and hence it's the background color

171
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.852
that's targeted bright primary.

172
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:40.059
You got up on primary argument to control the color

173
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.780
of the content on the primary color.

174
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.440
So in this case, the foreground color on the background

175
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.610
so you could dense it this two colors dot white.

176
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.880
And for example, change this to orange here

177
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.960
and now with that we would have a simplified way

178
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.573
of setting the background and the foreground color here.

179
00:09:03.714 --> 00:09:06.190
And you can use either of the two approaches.

180
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.380
Create this button style object

181
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.560
and set background and foreground color,

182
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.960
which is very explicit, but a bit longer

183
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.420
or use this style from method to set primary

184
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.090
and on primary.

185
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.914
Now attached to this lecture, you also find a link

186
00:09:21.914 --> 00:09:26.570
to the official button migration documentation,

187
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.990
a document which will also explore

188
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.950
how to migrate your buttons

189
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.520
and which we'll dig a bit deeper into styling these buttons.

190
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.263
And therefore you can check out that document as well.

191
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.350
Now that's the ElevatedButton,

192
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.950
which is our old RaisedButton.

193
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.490
Now for the FlatButton,

194
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.683
we now have them TextButton.

195
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.020
The TextButton replaces the FlatButton

196
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.060
and just like the ElevatedButton,

197
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.550
it doesn't have these individuals style arguments anymore.

198
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.680
Instead, it has one style argument,

199
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.750
and here again you set a button style by instantiating it

200
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.540
and then there you can set the foreground color

201
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.040
to control the text

202
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.880
and also still a background color,

203
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.190
if you wanna add a background color.

204
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.200
By default a TextButton does not have a background though,

205
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.430
because the idea behind that TextButton is

206
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.280
that it's just text no background color.

207
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.810
But alternatively to setting this button style

208
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.930
with foreground, and maybe background,

209
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.025
and maybe other styles,

210
00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:33.000
you can also use TextButton style from here again,

211
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.630
and then here set primary

212
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.620
to colors dot blue or maybe orange.

213
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.620
So did we see a difference?

214
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.950
If I save this now the text is orange

215
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.220
and that's important.

216
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.136
Primary is not always the background color

217
00:10:47.136 --> 00:10:51.460
instead primary really targets the primary thing

218
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.850
that makes up this button.

219
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.310
And for an ElevatedButton,

220
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.710
the primary element is the background

221
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.760
because that's the main thing that makes up ElevatedButton.

222
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.480
It's a button with a background

223
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.870
and therefore for primary targets that background.

224
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.330
And on primary targets, the foreground

225
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.960
or the TextButton, the primary element is the text

226
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.290
and hence primary targets the text color.

227
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.737
Here, we also have no on primary argument we could set

228
00:11:18.737 --> 00:11:20.816
because the TextButton is about

229
00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:23.530
not having a background color.

230
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.150
If you want the background color,

231
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.180
use an ElevatedButton.

232
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.563
So that's how we can translate the FlatButton.

233
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.100
Now for the OutlinedButton,

234
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.690
we have the new outlined button.

235
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.020
So the extra D here matters

236
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.010
and that will then replace your old OutlinedButton.

237
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.760
Here, we again don't have those individual style properties

238
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.220
instead, we can add the new style argument here,

239
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.370
and set this to a borders style again

240
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.660
where we then target the individual styling elements

241
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.640
like side for the border side.

242
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.425
So the border of color ends on

243
00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:03.760
or we use OutlinedButton style from,

244
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.130
and then here again, we can, for example

245
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.830
set the primary color to colors dot orange.

246
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.040
And if we do that,

247
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.270
you will notice that now it's the text again

248
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.883
which is orange.

249
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.500
For restyling the border,

250
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.240
we have this site argument here,

251
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.240
and you can always use the auto-completion

252
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.810
to see which different arguments you can set here.

253
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.270
And that wants a border side object

254
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.590
which you construct by calling the borders site constructor

255
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.403
and then there, you can set the color of the border site.

256
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.830
So of the border overall.

257
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.583
And if you now save this, you have an orange border.

258
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.420
And that's how we can migrate

259
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.452
from the old buttons to the new buttons.

260
00:12:54.452 --> 00:12:57.510
RaisedButton becomes ElevatedButton,

261
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.630
FlatButton becomes TextButton

262
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.630
and OutlinedButton becomes OutlinedButton with an extra D.

263
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.580
For simple cases where you don't set any colors or styling,

264
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.110
you can just swap the widget names

265
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.190
for more complex buttons,

266
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.840
where you do add your own colors or your own stylings.

267
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.810
There you instead add this style argument

268
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.630
instead of the individual style arguments.

269
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.200
And then there, you either create a button style object

270
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.661
with foreground background color and so on

271
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:34.460
or you use these style from methods,

272
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.430
on the button classes

273
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.140
to assign primary colors, background colors,

274
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.423
border colors and so on.

275
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.270
Now, as I mentioned,

276
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.920
you can stick to the old buttons as well.

277
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.090
They will definitely also stay around for many months

278
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.190
but you can, of course also migrate

279
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.830
to these new buttons instead,

280
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.932
because overall as you see,

281
00:13:54.932 --> 00:13:58.580
migrating isn't too difficult in the end.

282
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.145
It's often just about swapping the names

283
00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:04.615
or also about adding these extra style arguments

284
00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:09.133
which then in the end also, aren't too difficult to use.
