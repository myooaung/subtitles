1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,530
Now let's briefly plan what we're going to build and where we're going to add which feature in our application.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,990
We're essentially have two main screens.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:18,620
We'll have this authentication part where you enter email, username and password and where you can

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,720
also pick and upload an image.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,290
And once a user is authenticated, we'll also have this chat screen where you can send messages and

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,080
also see messages by our users always combined with their image and all the user name.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:39,950
We'll also implement push notifications there at the end to make sure that if our app is closed, we

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,580
actually get a notification about a new message and we can then tap this message to, well, bring this

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,720
app back up.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,230
Now in this module we're going to use Firebase.

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,550
And Firebase is a fully managed backend service.

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,350
It's by Google, just like Flutter, but it's totally independent from Flutter.

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,450
You don't have to use Firebase with Flutter.

14
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,670
It works without Flutter as well.

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,290
Now, we actually already did use Firebase in this course.

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,420
We used it as a dummy backend API in the HTTP section and so on.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,880
Firebase is not just that though.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:23,570
I used it there because that allowed me to show you how you can connect flutter to any backend without

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,260
having to write any backend code here because this is a flutter course.

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,570
So therefore I wanted to focus on flutter, but that's the only reason why I used Firebase there.

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,300
We didn't really utilize any amazing Firebase features in those sections.

22
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,090
Well, now we're going to do that and I will show you that if you use Firebase, not just because it's

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,720
a nice dummy backend, but because you want to use it and you want to build a complete app where Firebase

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,660
runs your backend that Firebase ships with a lot of cool features that make building a powerful app

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,020
a breeze and integrating Firebase into Flutter is actually also pretty straightforward.

26
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,550
But what do I mean when I say fully managed backend service?

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,979
What is Firebase all about in the end?

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,940
Well, Firebase consists of a bunch of cool services.

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,870
For example, it comes with data storage with a database, and it comes with an API that makes talking

30
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,520
through that database easy.

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,420
To be precise, it also comes with a bunch of sticks.

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,500
So with a bunch of packages which you can install in, for example, flutter apps to make working with

33
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,630
Firebase Extra Simple.

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,020
Now, besides the database for storing data, Firebase, for example, also has a file storage for,

35
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,750
you guessed it, storing files and uploading files with the Firebase SDK, which we're going to do in

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,720
this module, will also be extra simple.

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,710
Firebase also comes with built in authentication services so that you can easily add authentication

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,930
to your app without having to write your own logic for that, which can be fairly difficult and which

39
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,130
of course also has to be done right to avoid security issues.

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,760
Now, Firebase also comes with a push notification service, which makes sending push notifications

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,380
to both Android as well as iOS apps very, very easy.

42
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,080
And we're going to utilize this in this module as well.

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,480
And Firebase also has more than that.

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,520
It comes with analytics services.

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,730
You can run server side code with a feature called Cloud Functions if you need to do that so that you

46
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,700
can run your own code and not just talk to their preconfigured database and it has much, much more.

47
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,550
We're not going to explore everything here because this, of course, is a flatter course, not a firebase

48
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:49,610
course, but we'll use some of the coolest feature in detail in this module, to be precise.

49
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,440
We're going to work with the data storage and database, with the file storage and authentication,

50
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,440
and we'll also see some on demand server side code in action with help of those cloud functions.

51
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,450
So a lot of stuff to do.

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,600
Let's get started with an app and let's start building that app and that's then step by step, add cool

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,460
Firebase features to it.
