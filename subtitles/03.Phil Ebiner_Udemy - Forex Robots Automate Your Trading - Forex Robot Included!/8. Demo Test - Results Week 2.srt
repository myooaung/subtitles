00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:09,790
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,810  -->  00:00:15,060
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization and meditated for it has been two weeks since

3

00:00:15,060  -->  00:00:16,160
we launched demo tests.

4

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:20,680
And I just want to check in with you to keep you up to date with what's going on.

5

00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:22,530
I'll just bring up the calendar here.

6

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:27,170
And as you can see we launched Demel tests on Monday the 8th of September.

7

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:30,840
Today is Friday the 19th of September 2014.

8

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:36,930
So it's been two full working weeks that the deputies have been running for and let's have a look at

9

00:00:36,930  -->  00:00:38,020
the results so far.

10

00:00:38,250  -->  00:00:41,880
So this first set simple system said one where our was 10.

11

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:44,800
It has not created an profitable trades at all.

12

00:00:44,940  -->  00:00:50,360
And moreover it's lost nearly 20 just over 27 percent of its deposit.

13

00:00:50,370  -->  00:00:55,760
So we can quite confidently say that we should discard this set no no and try.

14

00:00:55,860  -->  00:01:03,170
At this stage next one simple system set to where our was nine as you can see there were some losses

15

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:10,560
but then there was a substantial profit which was about three times the size of a loss just more than

16

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:10,970
that.

17

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:18,900
And that kind of helped that recover the deposit a bit and currently is battling to get this profit

18

00:01:18,900  -->  00:01:20,170
on the sell order.

19

00:01:20,180  -->  00:01:23,280
It's at 640 dollars profit right now.

20

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:26,940
And it just scrape the take profit which didn't trigger it.

21

00:01:26,970  -->  00:01:28,340
So we'll see how that goes.

22

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:36,110
But I wouldn't get my hopes up for this system at this stage because it does look quite risky.

23

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:42,870
The next one is simple system set three or four so far as my favorite one because it's had a mix of

24

00:01:43,080  -->  00:01:44,690
profits and losses.

25

00:01:45,000  -->  00:01:47,670
Before we continue I'll just show you a quick handy trick.

26

00:01:47,670  -->  00:01:57,150
So if you drag a order onto the chart so it has to be the same chart as the chart of the same instrument

27

00:01:57,150  -->  00:02:03,750
as the order if you drag it onto that chart then you'll see that the order just appears there and that's

28

00:02:03,750  -->  00:02:06,990
a very handy way to view your historical orders.

29

00:02:06,990  -->  00:02:12,210
Moreover if you want to see all of them then you just click on any one of them hold shift on your keyboard

30

00:02:12,240  -->  00:02:14,690
and drag that order onto the chart.

31

00:02:14,730  -->  00:02:19,940
What that will do is all of the orders for that currency pair will appear on the chart.

32

00:02:20,070  -->  00:02:24,540
Just be careful not to drag a different currency parent child because that might change the chart and

33

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:26,760
that might affect our expert wiser.

34

00:02:26,970  -->  00:02:29,580
So here you can see there was a profit.

35

00:02:29,590  -->  00:02:36,990
Then there was a another profit a small loss and another profit another profit and no trades in the

36

00:02:36,990  -->  00:02:37,970
past two days.

37

00:02:37,980  -->  00:02:46,590
So it's a good mix a good mix of profit and profitable loss trades in the sense that we kind of see

38

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:48,510
all the aspects of the system there's a profit.

39

00:02:48,510  -->  00:02:53,970
A lot of the profits are at take profit this profit was like a stop or time don't take profit.

40

00:02:53,970  -->  00:02:57,200
It was caused by the system because I knew order was great.

41

00:02:57,210  -->  00:02:58,810
And then this one as well.

42

00:02:59,370  -->  00:03:05,400
So and if we go into the parameters as you can see that the take profit is 50 and still plus 6 so they're

43

00:03:05,400  -->  00:03:06,380
pretty close.

44

00:03:06,390  -->  00:03:08,290
And I kind of like that system.

45

00:03:08,310  -->  00:03:16,530
It's not too adventurous and so let's let's see how this one keeps going so far as fiery like the result

46

00:03:16,530  -->  00:03:17,100
.

47

00:03:17,130  -->  00:03:25,450
And then finally simple systems set for our eight only profitable trades no open orders no losses.

48

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:28,090
The profits are quite small so we'll do the same.

49

00:03:28,080  -->  00:03:34,260
We'll just drag this onto the chart holding down shift and you'll see that the profits are quite small

50

00:03:34,260  -->  00:03:39,780
so it's going for small take profits here it's 20 and the stop loss would be three times as high it

51

00:03:39,780  -->  00:03:42,280
would be 60 if it were to occur.

52

00:03:42,660  -->  00:03:47,440
So I I do like this one but it is a bit more risky.

53

00:03:47,580  -->  00:03:54,240
The ratio of take profit to stop loss isn't as good but we'll have to look at it see how it goes in

54

00:03:54,240  -->  00:03:57,770
the coming weeks and make hard decisions that end.

55

00:03:57,780  -->  00:04:04,140
And finally at the end of the story I wanted to mention that today I will be launching a real test of

56

00:04:04,350  -->  00:04:07,290
a simple system version 5.0.

57

00:04:07,710  -->  00:04:09,800
It'll be quite interesting test.

58

00:04:09,810  -->  00:04:16,260
I'll be putting $500 of my own money on the line to see how this 4 x robot behaves in real market conditions

59

00:04:16,260  -->  00:04:16,750
.

60

00:04:16,770  -->  00:04:23,480
Also you'll notice that in the course when you're going through it the real test tutorials come after

61

00:04:23,490  -->  00:04:25,330
the demo test tutorials.

62

00:04:25,330  -->  00:04:30,540
And in that way the kernel chronological order isn't maintained.

63

00:04:30,540  -->  00:04:36,180
However I thought it would make more sense to first have all the charges relating to the demo test and

64

00:04:36,180  -->  00:04:39,220
then all tutorials relating to the real test.

65

00:04:39,570  -->  00:04:42,980
So there's just something to keep in mind when you're going through this course.

66

00:04:42,980  -->  00:04:47,680
Other than that thanks for this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

67

00:04:47,940  -->  00:04:49,120
Until then happy trading
