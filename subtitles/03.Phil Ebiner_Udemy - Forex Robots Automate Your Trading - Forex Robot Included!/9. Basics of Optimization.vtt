00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:09.970
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.990  -->  00:00:16.590
And welcome to the editorial on testing and optimization in literature for the Preuss tutorial we talked

3

00:00:16.590  -->  00:00:21.480
about the forward test and today we will be discussing the concept of optimization.

4

00:00:21.570  -->  00:00:25.600
Before we dive in for those of you who are watching this course Udemy I'd like to ask you a favor.

5

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:30.010
I know we're not finished yet but if you've already gotten a lot of value out of the scores which my

6

00:00:30.030  -->  00:00:35.340
leaving a review even just clicking the number of stars you feel the course does so far would be helpful

7

00:00:35.370  -->  00:00:35.500
.

8

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:40.380
I'm asking you now since a lot of students originally intend to leave reviews at the end of the course

9

00:00:40.410  -->  00:00:44.720
but never do because they forget or never finish the course for whatever reasons.

10

00:00:44.790  -->  00:00:49.020
If you're not sure right now you can always change the review or just leave one layer it's totally up

11

00:00:49.020  -->  00:00:49.630
to you.

12

00:00:49.920  -->  00:00:51.730
OK now on with the show.

13

00:00:52.110  -->  00:00:53.980
So what is optimization.

14

00:00:54.090  -->  00:00:59.640
According to the Oxford dictionary to optimize means to make the best or most effective use of what

15

00:00:59.640  -->  00:01:03.940
does that mean for us when we're using algorithmic trading systems on the forex market.

16

00:01:04.230  -->  00:01:12.070
Well as you can recall from Tauriel than before every 4 x robot comes with a set of parameters that

17

00:01:12.070  -->  00:01:19.470
you are able to change in order to adjust the behavior of the forex robot on the for X market and by

18

00:01:19.470  -->  00:01:25.420
adjusting these parameters you can get the force over to produce unprofitably results.

19

00:01:25.440  -->  00:01:28.090
Or you can get it to produce profitable results.

20

00:01:28.110  -->  00:01:36.690
So for us optimization will mean finding the optimal set of parameters that will yield the highest possible

21

00:01:36.690  -->  00:01:39.730
result and that will give us the best return.

22

00:01:40.350  -->  00:01:42.860
So let's look at an example.

23

00:01:43.050  -->  00:01:47.030
As you can recall this is a time timeline that we looked at in the previous tutorial.

24

00:01:47.030  -->  00:01:50.680
Let's for a second forget about the forward test.

25

00:01:50.790  -->  00:02:00.300
So this is how we conduct back tests on the 4 X market and say for instance that we have come up with

26

00:02:00.300  -->  00:02:06.690
five different sets of parameters for a forex robot and we want to check which of those five parameters

27

00:02:06.990  -->  00:02:10.000
is the best for us to use and trading.

28

00:02:10.110  -->  00:02:17.040
So what we would do is we would write all these five out here and we would run five separate back tests

29

00:02:17.430  -->  00:02:17.920
.

30

00:02:18.450  -->  00:02:25.430
And then we would choose out of the results of say for example that the results are as follows.

31

00:02:25.650  -->  00:02:31.530
Obviously right away we can see that these two are unprofitable and we would discard set number three

32

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:35.380
and said not before and out of the remaining sets we would choose the most profitable ones.

33

00:02:35.490  -->  00:02:44.730
This one of course this is a very basic approach and in reality we would look at other things like the

34

00:02:44.730  -->  00:02:50.740
ratios that are available in a strategy test report for example would look at the profit factor and

35

00:02:50.730  -->  00:02:57.600
the expected payoff and also we would want to run some forward tests to see that these results would

36

00:02:57.600  -->  00:03:04.740
actually perform these sets would actually perform in a similar fashion on this data that we still have

37

00:03:04.740  -->  00:03:07.040
here available for a forward test.

38

00:03:07.200  -->  00:03:12.060
But in its essence this is the approach to about to optimization.

39

00:03:12.060  -->  00:03:14.030
You just come up with a set of parameters.

40

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:19.950
You run the BAC tests for those parameters and you look at the results that those parameters yield and

41

00:03:19.950  -->  00:03:27.300
then you choose the best one of course this process can be quite lengthy because sometimes 4 X systems

42

00:03:27.300  -->  00:03:32.670
have multiple parameters and when you look at all the different possible combinations of parameters

43

00:03:33.060  -->  00:03:38.880
it can grow exponentially and can be in the tens of thousands of different factors and there's virtually

44

00:03:38.880  -->  00:03:44.560
no way for a person to run all those back Tests manually in a short period of time.

45

00:03:44.580  -->  00:03:48.540
So this is where metatrader 4 comes in to help us out.

46

00:03:48.750  -->  00:03:55.140
Metro for four has inbuilt functionality for us to perform optimizations on the fly.

47

00:03:55.650  -->  00:04:02.150
So how it is this done let's have a look at a standard expert adviser inputs card.

48

00:04:02.400  -->  00:04:10.140
And here you can see that we're looking at the simple system inputs and this system is a proprietary

49

00:04:10.140  -->  00:04:15.060
system which we will be discussing in more detail in the next section.

50

00:04:15.310  -->  00:04:20.820
However right away from here we can see that there are two parameters take profit and sapless which

51

00:04:20.820  -->  00:04:26.210
probably are responsible for the targets for this trading strategy.

52

00:04:26.280  -->  00:04:28.530
And currently they're set at 40 each.

53

00:04:28.530  -->  00:04:35.040
What we can do and share for is we can tick the box on the left here say for example the stop loss and

54

00:04:35.040  -->  00:04:40.110
that way we will tell a trader for that we want to optimize this particular variable.

55

00:04:40.260  -->  00:04:47.580
What it will do is it therefore will keep these other variables constant as as they're set but it will

56

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:54.360
ignore disvalue for Stop-Loss instead of this value it will actually run multiple back tests based on

57

00:04:54.360  -->  00:04:55.670
these values here.

58

00:04:55.680  -->  00:05:02.220
So what in reality will happen is a back test will be run for this value for the starting value of 20

59

00:05:02.460  -->  00:05:07.820
and then that back test will be run for with an increment of this step value.

60

00:05:07.820  -->  00:05:14.580
Also 20 until it traded for reaches a stock value so a back test will be around for Stop-Loss equals

61

00:05:14.580  -->  00:05:17.790
20 40 60 80 and a hundred.

62

00:05:17.790  -->  00:05:21.950
So in total there will be 5 back tests that will be run.

63

00:05:21.990  -->  00:05:25.350
Also you can optimize take profit if you like.

64

00:05:25.350  -->  00:05:29.520
And similarly in this case another five tests will be run.

65

00:05:29.760  -->  00:05:35.960
But what if you want to optimize the combination of take profit or stop loss while you can do that Ameritrade

66

00:05:36.090  -->  00:05:37.950
for you just take both boxes.

67

00:05:37.950  -->  00:05:44.510
And in this case a total of five times five equals 25 back to us will be around.

68

00:05:44.730  -->  00:05:51.900
And as you can see that way you can combine any number of different parameters to be run in one or one

69

00:05:51.900  -->  00:05:53.950
big optimization.

70

00:05:54.060  -->  00:05:58.330
So that's some how we can do optimization and therian.

71

00:05:58.380  -->  00:06:05.970
Let's have a quick look at Ameritrade for and see how that all plays out in there as you can see here

72

00:06:05.970  -->  00:06:06.160
.

73

00:06:06.270  -->  00:06:09.410
I've got the moving average expert advisor open.

74

00:06:09.520  -->  00:06:11.200
We're going to go into its properties.

75

00:06:11.520  -->  00:06:15.540
First thing we're going to do is we are gonna to make sure that the genetic algorithm is switched off

76

00:06:16.350  -->  00:06:21.180
the genetic algorithm is something we'll be discussing in the last section of this course when we're

77

00:06:21.180  -->  00:06:27.750
talking about a more in-depth optimizations and but for now we'll just leave it off because we don't

78

00:06:27.750  -->  00:06:28.410
need it.

79

00:06:28.470  -->  00:06:35.610
And here we will take the moving period and moving shift parameters and the save for the moving period

80

00:06:35.610  -->  00:06:38.210
will set it at 10.

81

00:06:38.220  -->  00:06:41.940
Start at step of 10 and we'll go all the way up to 100.

82

00:06:41.940  -->  00:06:47.550
So that's the period of the moving average and the shift will go from zero for step 1 all the way up

83

00:06:47.550  -->  00:06:48.030
to 10.

84

00:06:48.030  -->  00:06:50.920
And that's the shift of the working hours.

85

00:06:51.030  -->  00:06:56.820
So it will do now click OK then I'll make sure that this optimization box box is checked and then will

86

00:06:56.820  -->  00:06:58.180
kickstart.

87

00:06:58.620  -->  00:07:05.930
So because we're using every take military force collecting data here and there it goes.

88

00:07:06.210  -->  00:07:12.360
Optimization is running as you can see two new tabs have appeared optimization results in optimization

89

00:07:12.360  -->  00:07:13.200
Grof.

90

00:07:13.200  -->  00:07:22.080
If we click into the optimization graph you'll see 110 different results because we had 110 BAC tests

91

00:07:22.080  -->  00:07:28.890
that were conducted and in optimization results we have a list of results sorted by profit.

92

00:07:28.890  -->  00:07:35.670
Now I would like to mention that if you see less results here than you have to or here you have to right

93

00:07:35.670  -->  00:07:40.220
click and you have to make sure that this check box is off.

94

00:07:40.260  -->  00:07:46.230
Skip use useless results because if it's on then Medicare for won't be showing you results that did

95

00:07:46.230  -->  00:07:50.410
not make a profit so I'll just expand this quickly so we can see more.

96

00:07:50.610  -->  00:07:53.500
So their results here that were negative.

97

00:07:53.760  -->  00:07:57.260
And if that check box is on then you won't see them.

98

00:07:57.300  -->  00:07:59.550
So if it it were it is on by default.

99

00:07:59.550  -->  00:08:03.000
So you have to switch it all off and then rerun the test again.

100

00:08:03.570  -->  00:08:05.420
And now we see all of these results.

101

00:08:05.430  -->  00:08:10.620
And as you can see the most profitable results is up here we can see the Profit Factor expected payoff

102

00:08:10.650  -->  00:08:11.600
and everything.

103

00:08:11.610  -->  00:08:13.750
And these are the parameters that we're here on the right.

104

00:08:14.010  -->  00:08:22.080
So as you can see this report is very handy and we'll learn how to use it in more detail further down

105

00:08:22.080  -->  00:08:22.650
in the scores.

106

00:08:22.650  -->  00:08:27.890
But for now what we'll do is we'll just right click on the top result will click Set Input Parameters

107

00:08:27.930  -->  00:08:36.360
and what it does is it takes off optimization and iterative populates these parameters for us into our

108

00:08:36.360  -->  00:08:37.270
expert advisor.

109

00:08:37.290  -->  00:08:43.530
Now we can just quickly run it and see how the robot performs with these parameters.

110

00:08:43.560  -->  00:08:46.710
So now we're running this back test.

111

00:08:47.340  -->  00:08:53.260
And now if we go to results or sort of go to Graaff as you can see this is a prophylactic.

112

00:08:53.430  -->  00:08:59.890
Obviously it's not as good because this is a pre-packaged standard expert advisor that comes with metor

113

00:08:59.890  -->  00:09:07.260
trader for but as you can see many for Help us optimize the parameters and find the best ones for us

114

00:09:07.260  -->  00:09:07.990
.

115

00:09:08.040  -->  00:09:09.620
So that's all for today's tutorial.

116

00:09:09.660  -->  00:09:13.920
If you are watching and you do me please don't forget to rate the scores and perhaps leave me a review

117

00:09:13.920  -->  00:09:14.340
.

118

00:09:14.370  -->  00:09:16.290
I hope you found this information useful.

119

00:09:16.320  -->  00:09:18.690
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

120

00:09:18.690  -->  00:09:20.100
Until then Happy training
