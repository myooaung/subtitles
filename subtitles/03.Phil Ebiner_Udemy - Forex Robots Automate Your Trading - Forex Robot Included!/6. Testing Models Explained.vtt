00:00:07.680  -->  00:00:09.780
Hello this is Kirill from Farley's dot com.

2

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:15.120
And welcome back to the series of tutorials on testing and optimization and meditated for today's return

3

00:00:15.140  -->  00:00:15.720
them five.

4

00:00:15.780  -->  00:00:21.910
And we're going to be talking about the different models that are available for back tests and megatrend

5

00:00:21.930  -->  00:00:26.000
for the models can be found here in this dropdown menu.

6

00:00:26.070  -->  00:00:32.220
And as you can see there are three distinct models for back tests which are every tick control points

7

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:33.800
and open prices.

8

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:39.840
And today we will discuss benefits and drawbacks of each one of these models and most importantly we

9

00:00:39.840  -->  00:00:45.730
will understand when and why to use either of these models for your back tests.

10

00:00:45.750  -->  00:00:50.620
So without further ado let's proceed to the presentation for today.

11

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:52.270
Testing models.

12

00:00:52.440  -->  00:00:53.280
Let's look at a scenario.

13

00:00:53.280  -->  00:00:59.770
We have three bars to bullish one Barish and let's assume that we're working on a 15 minute timeframe

14

00:00:59.860  -->  00:01:00.310
.

15

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:05.430
As you all probably know though it's the open high low and close prices.

16

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:11.550
First of all the open prices model the open prices model is the most basic out of the three models and

17

00:01:11.580  -->  00:01:18.030
all it does is it looks at the open price for every single bar so assuming that we have four bars including

18

00:01:18.030  -->  00:01:24.900
this next one or we hear the open prices model will only take into account for reference points which

19

00:01:24.960  -->  00:01:27.600
it will use in the back test.

20

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:33.330
So as you can see that's why it's very basic and that's why it's also very quick because it doesn't

21

00:01:33.540  -->  00:01:40.080
take much time to just look at one price for every bar next model is the control points model the control

22

00:01:40.080  -->  00:01:47.410
points model is the next step up from the open prices model what it does is it takes a bit more effort

23

00:01:47.410  -->  00:01:47.450
.

24

00:01:47.450  -->  00:01:52.380
Point reference points and took months to understand this better let's look at this bar in the middle

25

00:01:52.380  -->  00:01:54.690
let's zoom in because it's an M 15 bar.

26

00:01:54.690  -->  00:01:58.730
It is actually constructed of three and five bars.

27

00:01:58.830  -->  00:02:06.960
So what the control points model will do is it'll take the open low high and close prices for every

28

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:08.380
single one of these bars.

29

00:02:08.490  -->  00:02:12.460
Making that three times for 12 reference points.

30

00:02:12.690  -->  00:02:20.310
What it will then do is it will model the ticks in between those reference points so therefore there

31

00:02:20.310  -->  00:02:27.500
will be much more ticks in the control points model and they will all be used for the back test.

32

00:02:27.810  -->  00:02:33.300
And finally the every take moral of every tick model is the most precise of the three and it is the

33

00:02:33.300  -->  00:02:41.580
most precise you can get in a trade for what it does is it not only breaks down the bar into the next

34

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:49.860
lower timeframe but it also takes into account all of the other lower timeframes So in our case it would

35

00:02:49.860  -->  00:02:58.650
be the M5 and the 1 bar so here I've illustrated the hypothetical M1 bars for this one 15 bars and as

36

00:02:58.650  -->  00:03:00.720
you can see there's 15 of them in here.

37

00:03:00.930  -->  00:03:06.300
If we were working on the daily chart then the every tick model would take into account reference points

38

00:03:06.300  -->  00:03:11.850
from the already charged from for our teacher from the 30 minute chart from the 15 minute five minute

39

00:03:11.880  -->  00:03:12.750
and 1 minute chart.

40

00:03:12.750  -->  00:03:18.000
So from all of the timeframes that are built up once again it takes the open high low and close prices

41

00:03:18.000  -->  00:03:21.560
as reference points I haven't illustrated here.

42

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:27.210
But what it does it also models takes in between this price is because trader for actually knows how

43

00:03:27.210  -->  00:03:29.680
many ticks there should be.

44

00:03:29.900  -->  00:03:35.580
The Count of ticks is stored in Metatrader 4 and therefore it models the ticks in between those prices

45

00:03:35.580  -->  00:03:39.050
using sophisticated wave models and so on.

46

00:03:39.060  -->  00:03:42.450
But we don't need to go deeper than that penetrator For takes care of that.

47

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:49.200
Based on that our back Tests conducted and that is why it takes a much longer time than the other two

48

00:03:49.230  -->  00:03:54.640
and that is also why it is much more precise because we have a lot more reference points.

49

00:03:55.020  -->  00:04:01.680
And so the summary for these three models is that we'll go from bottom to top so the bottom one is open

50

00:04:01.680  -->  00:04:03.840
prices model the least precise one.

51

00:04:03.900  -->  00:04:09.960
When would you use the open prices model you would use it only if your if you want an indicative result

52

00:04:09.990  -->  00:04:12.040
of the performance of the system.

53

00:04:12.090  -->  00:04:18.120
Definitely something you shouldn't rely on but there are cases when you can actually legitimately use

54

00:04:18.510  -->  00:04:22.180
the open prices model to test your Forex system.

55

00:04:22.320  -->  00:04:30.120
And that is when your expert adviser only uses the open prices of the previous bars if that is the case

56

00:04:30.120  -->  00:04:31.380
for your expert advice.

57

00:04:31.400  -->  00:04:37.620
If he does if it doesn't take into account the OSC and the bid price or values of indicators within

58

00:04:37.620  -->  00:04:44.220
the bar if it only works with the ready finalized bars and only looks at their open prices then you

59

00:04:44.220  -->  00:04:50.370
can use the open prices model to legitimately test or optimize your 4 X system and that's a very important

60

00:04:50.370  -->  00:04:55.710
point because it can save you a lot of time since the open prices model is the fastest of the three

61

00:04:55.710  -->  00:04:55.890
.

62

00:04:55.950  -->  00:05:00.720
There is not much point in using the every tick model if you're going to get the same result before

63

00:05:00.760  -->  00:05:06.300
and prices also I've put in brackets here that if your expert was only used as close prices you can

64

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:07.570
still use this model.

65

00:05:07.680  -->  00:05:14.970
And that's because of the open price is effectively the close price of the previous bar the control

66

00:05:14.970  -->  00:05:21.300
points model it can also give you an indicative result which would be much closer to the actual result

67

00:05:21.300  -->  00:05:22.110
of the system.

68

00:05:22.110  -->  00:05:29.910
But also you can you should only use it for reference and you can also use the control points method

69

00:05:29.910  -->  00:05:38.280
for legitimate testing of expert advisors which only use open high low and close prices of the finalized

70

00:05:38.280  -->  00:05:40.640
bars which are to the left of the current one.

71

00:05:41.010  -->  00:05:45.750
And finally the every tick model is the best quality model that you can get in Ameritrade for and it

72

00:05:45.750  -->  00:05:52.980
should be used for testing of most expert advisers unless you have this intrinsic knowledge of the expert

73

00:05:52.980  -->  00:05:53.940
advisor.

74

00:05:54.000  -->  00:06:00.660
So you go back to the terminal and see how this all plays out in the tests or we'll just select the

75

00:06:00.660  -->  00:06:04.950
moving average expert advisor as you can see here I've selected open prices.

76

00:06:04.950  -->  00:06:09.080
I've set a date for the two previous months and will keep visual mode on.

77

00:06:09.120  -->  00:06:10.830
And let's see how this works.

78

00:06:10.830  -->  00:06:17.790
So as you can see and open prices the terminal is only generating 1 take for everybody.

79

00:06:17.910  -->  00:06:23.610
It is drawing the whole bar but you should know that it's only taking into account the very first take

80

00:06:23.610  -->  00:06:26.070
of every bar which represents the open price.

81

00:06:26.070  -->  00:06:29.640
That is why this test is very quick and very precise.

82

00:06:29.790  -->  00:06:31.550
If I speed this up it's are a done.

83

00:06:31.590  -->  00:06:34.540
That's how quick it is and there's a result.

84

00:06:34.560  -->  00:06:41.880
Now if we move on to control points and do the same thing you will notice that much more ticks generated

85

00:06:41.880  -->  00:06:42.790
for every bar.

86

00:06:42.840  -->  00:06:49.020
We'll zoom in quickly here and as you can see Menchu for is generating quite a few takes on every bar

87

00:06:49.020  -->  00:06:49.470
.

88

00:06:49.650  -->  00:06:55.110
It isn't too many but it is taking into account those reference points we talked about.

89

00:06:55.380  -->  00:07:02.130
Once again this test is pretty quick so if I speed this up once again then it's finished already.

90

00:07:02.120  -->  00:07:07.320
So now if I go to or go to the graph as you can see the results pretty much the same and appear you

91

00:07:07.320  -->  00:07:12.400
have a warning message saying that this is control points and the results must not be considered.

92

00:07:12.420  -->  00:07:18.480
Now if we do every tick and we slow this down we'll start this as you can see mental force collecting

93

00:07:18.480  -->  00:07:23.820
and one daughter now will be collecting amphi or it already collected in 5.0 very quickly.

94

00:07:23.820  -->  00:07:30.000
Basically it uses that data to generate those reference points and then model that takes in between

95

00:07:30.000  -->  00:07:30.390
them.

96

00:07:30.380  -->  00:07:37.410
So if we speed this up a little bit you'll see that there are quite a lot of takes being generated within

97

00:07:37.710  -->  00:07:44.150
each bar and the test is progressing very quick not very quickly actually very slowly.

98

00:07:44.430  -->  00:07:50.670
And that's why this method takes much longer but it is much more precise because you get that a large

99

00:07:50.670  -->  00:07:52.040
number of ticks.

100

00:07:52.050  -->  00:07:56.320
So if I speed this up it takes a bit longer to finalize that test.

101

00:07:56.370  -->  00:07:59.240
We look at the graph it is similar again here.

102

00:07:59.400  -->  00:08:04.560
There is no warning message it says every tick the most precise method based on all available this time

103

00:08:04.560  -->  00:08:06.140
for us to generate each tick.

104

00:08:06.260  -->  00:08:15.060
And it gives us the percentage or this is an indication of how precise your method is method was or

105

00:08:15.060  -->  00:08:19.670
how relevant this test is in terms of real trading.

106

00:08:19.680  -->  00:08:22.550
So it's got 89 59 percent.

107

00:08:22.550  -->  00:08:25.230
And I think that anything above 80 percent is good.

108

00:08:25.230  -->  00:08:35.490
Some people look for 90 or 95 percent modeling quality and you can improve that by downloading financial

109

00:08:35.490  -->  00:08:42.570
data from your broker or other sources and uploading it to try to for and that's something we'll talk

110

00:08:42.570  -->  00:08:47.630
about in further tutorials in this course.

111

00:08:47.630  -->  00:08:51.760
This will be a tutorial just done on that topic.

112

00:08:51.790  -->  00:08:58.530
And so one more thing before we finish off today's tutorial I'd like to give you a word of warning that

113

00:08:58.910  -->  00:09:03.290
even though it's called retake it's not actually literally every take.

114

00:09:03.330  -->  00:09:11.780
And I can prove this to you if we go into the history center here and we look at the bars of for years

115

00:09:11.790  -->  00:09:12.150
dollar.

116

00:09:12.140  -->  00:09:17.710
This basically shows you all the data of that store and met a trader for.

117

00:09:18.090  -->  00:09:24.250
And if you go to the hourly charge you can see that mentor is for stores information on every bar and

118

00:09:24.260  -->  00:09:30.030
only stores open high low close and volume volume is the number of ticks within that bar for M30.

119

00:09:30.110  -->  00:09:33.610
It's the same thing for him 5 it's the same thing for him 1 it's the same thing.

120

00:09:33.810  -->  00:09:40.920
The observation that we can make here is that there is no information on takes the lowest level of granularity

121

00:09:40.910  -->  00:09:45.930
that meditated for stores is the one minute timeframe bars.

122

00:09:45.960  -->  00:09:49.160
And it only has open high low and close price for them.

123

00:09:49.160  -->  00:09:52.490
So in reality they were actually age takes within that bar.

124

00:09:52.500  -->  00:09:56.150
But minutes later for only has four prices or for that bar.

125

00:09:56.280  -->  00:10:01.430
And this is why there were 12 takes Metatrader 4 only has four prices.

126

00:10:01.770  -->  00:10:07.710
And this is a historical phenomenon of metatrader 4 it has historically developed in such a way that

127

00:10:08.180  -->  00:10:14.960
this platform doesn't store data that just means that even though it is cold the model is called Every

128

00:10:14.970  -->  00:10:15.300
tick.

129

00:10:15.300  -->  00:10:22.040
It's not actually taking every take into account that wasn't reality and that is why you have this percentage

130

00:10:22.080  -->  00:10:28.160
that that's why it tells you that the accuracy of the model in this case is approximately 90 percent

131

00:10:28.160  -->  00:10:28.640
.

132

00:10:28.770  -->  00:10:36.120
You will probably never get 100 percent for that specific reason that military force doesn't store data

133

00:10:36.120  -->  00:10:36.510
.

134

00:10:36.510  -->  00:10:43.080
Having said that the tests that are trained for allows you to conduct are very accurate especially if

135

00:10:43.080  -->  00:10:45.810
every tick they yield pretty good results.

136

00:10:45.810  -->  00:10:55.170
And I certainly in my train carry I have relied on them for testing of my systems and I'm generally

137

00:10:55.160  -->  00:11:03.050
happy with for what meditator for allows me to see using this every tech model from most expert advisors

138

00:11:03.060  -->  00:11:03.750
.

139

00:11:03.750  -->  00:11:05.600
So that's the end of today's tutorial.

140

00:11:05.630  -->  00:11:06.840
I hope that it is useful.

141

00:11:06.840  -->  00:11:11.600
It was a bit longer than usual but personally I think that this information is very important.

142

00:11:11.700  -->  00:11:17.280
To further understand what's happening in the background of meditator for conducting these tests that's

143

00:11:17.280  -->  00:11:17.880
all for today.

144

00:11:17.880  -->  00:11:20.480
Hope to see you next time.

145

00:11:20.490  -->  00:11:22.940
And until then happy trading
