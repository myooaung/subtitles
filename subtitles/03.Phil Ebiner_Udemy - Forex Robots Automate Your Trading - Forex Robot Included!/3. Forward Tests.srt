00:00:06,830  -->  00:00:09,510
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,510  -->  00:00:14,970
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditative for in today's tutorial.

3

00:00:14,970  -->  00:00:20,900
We will be running forward tests for our expert advisor simple system version 5.0.

4

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:28,140
As you can see here we've already shortlisted six distinct sets for our expert adviser and the way we've

5

00:00:28,140  -->  00:00:32,020
come up with these is through optimizations.

6

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:35,180
And today we want to pick out the best ones out of them.

7

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:40,390
So let's say for example that you aim to pick out four sets out of the six.

8

00:00:40,590  -->  00:00:47,640
I'll just bring up a slide that we looked at in one of the Prue's tutorials and as you can see here

9

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:53,590
we've really done the back tests and optimizations and we use three months of daughter to do that.

10

00:00:53,700  -->  00:00:59,580
And according to this ratio of forward tests should be one month of data and that's exactly how much

11

00:00:59,580  -->  00:01:00,560
we have left.

12

00:01:00,570  -->  00:01:06,330
So by running those forward tests we'll be able to pick out the best four sets of parameters.

13

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:15,330
Also you can see that the hour is specified here and that's because our is a significant factor in our

14

00:01:15,630  -->  00:01:16,800
trading system.

15

00:01:16,800  -->  00:01:22,800
So it's important to know which set corresponds to which are right away we know we can notice that there

16

00:01:22,800  -->  00:01:30,230
are two sets corresponding to the hour nine and we wouldn't want to include both of them in our demo

17

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:32,250
tests that are upcoming.

18

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:38,220
So what we will do is we'll compare the two of them and pick only one.

19

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:46,080
And but of course given that the results are plausible and comparable to the rest.

20

00:01:46,230  -->  00:01:51,030
And by doing that we will already have one set and then out of the remaining four will only have to

21

00:01:51,660  -->  00:01:55,700
pick the best three and that we will end up with four sets.

22

00:01:55,890  -->  00:02:03,240
So let's go ahead and do that and we will start by looking at the our nine said I'll just cancel this

23

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:05,620
and show you what we need to do.

24

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:11,610
So if we go to expert properties and go to load and load our nine click OK.

25

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:16,230
And when you're going to run the back test again just to see what it looked like.

26

00:02:16,410  -->  00:02:23,520
This was a quite a good back test and in the report we see the profit was $3000.

27

00:02:23,550  -->  00:02:26,180
So now we run forward tests.

28

00:02:26,190  -->  00:02:36,030
We we have to move this to 8th of August and this 2 8th of September QuickStart and look at the chart

29

00:02:36,050  -->  00:02:36,480
.

30

00:02:36,870  -->  00:02:43,080
So the back test isn't as good but it's one of those holding ones so it would be still a right to keep

31

00:02:43,110  -->  00:02:49,110
but let's have a look at the other setting that we have.

32

00:02:49,110  -->  00:02:53,970
So we go to nine be low that click OK.

33

00:02:54,300  -->  00:02:57,800
We go back to the back test just to see how that performed.

34

00:02:58,170  -->  00:03:00,000
So the graph is very similar.

35

00:03:00,390  -->  00:03:06,500
Profit it is a bit less it's just over 3000 that it was a bit more with 3000.

36

00:03:06,840  -->  00:03:10,050
And now let's run the forward test.

37

00:03:10,050  -->  00:03:15,360
So we'll set this one for the one month start and look at the chart.

38

00:03:15,360  -->  00:03:17,750
The chart is much better in this case.

39

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:27,150
So out of the two nines we will keep only the second one so we'll go to the data will go to say load

40

00:03:27,600  -->  00:03:35,250
and we'll just put at the end of it we'll just put a plus 2 indicator we keeping it in and put a minus

41

00:03:35,250  -->  00:03:37,930
to indicate we're not keeping it.

42

00:03:38,130  -->  00:03:40,160
So now we have to compare these ones.

43

00:03:40,170  -->  00:03:44,040
So since we are loading data might as well just go ahead and load it.

44

00:03:44,040  -->  00:03:51,540
So let's look at the 10 go back to the back test.

45

00:03:51,540  -->  00:03:58,220
This was the back just looked like and the forward test looks like this.

46

00:03:58,320  -->  00:04:03,820
It's not too good it's not going straight up but it is a holding back test for test.

47

00:04:03,840  -->  00:04:06,810
So that's that's right.

48

00:04:06,810  -->  00:04:11,640
We probably can keep it but we need to check out the other three.

49

00:04:11,640  -->  00:04:19,970
So let's go into that for our fourth So we're back at 5.

50

00:04:20,040  -->  00:04:24,120
This is what the forward test looks like sort of the back test looked like.

51

00:04:24,120  -->  00:04:25,500
Now let's look at the forward test

52

00:04:28,230  -->  00:04:29,910
for test isn't too good.

53

00:04:29,910  -->  00:04:31,870
It is quite negative.

54

00:04:32,190  -->  00:04:39,470
So this is one potential candidate to be discarded.

55

00:04:39,540  -->  00:04:42,510
Let's look at the next one.

56

00:04:42,820  -->  00:04:46,760
All right.

57

00:04:49,880  -->  00:04:52,390
That is what our back tests look like.

58

00:04:52,390  -->  00:04:58,980
And let's look at the forward test for test is OK.

59

00:04:59,110  -->  00:05:00,170
It went up.

60

00:05:00,190  -->  00:05:06,510
There was obviously a loss trade here and that brought the deposit a bit down.

61

00:05:06,520  -->  00:05:11,360
But it is profitable So we'll keep that for now.

62

00:05:11,620  -->  00:05:16,700
And let's look at the last one said with our 7.

63

00:05:17,620  -->  00:05:19,650
So that's the back test.

64

00:05:19,910  -->  00:05:22,050
Practice is pretty good.

65

00:05:22,450  -->  00:05:29,330
And we look at the forward test for test is actually not good at all.

66

00:05:29,500  -->  00:05:33,460
As you can see here we have a evident trend going down.

67

00:05:33,460  -->  00:05:36,900
So we would want to see that on our account.

68

00:05:37,360  -->  00:05:40,900
So I think this is even worse than our for.

69

00:05:40,930  -->  00:05:43,110
We're going to have to discard this one.

70

00:05:43,390  -->  00:05:44,790
And there we go.

71

00:05:44,860  -->  00:05:50,220
That's how we can select our winners.

72

00:05:50,220  -->  00:05:51,850
So this is a minus.

73

00:05:51,850  -->  00:05:54,630
This is a plus.

74

00:05:54,720  -->  00:05:56,640
This is a plus.

75

00:05:56,980  -->  00:05:59,640
And this is a plus.

76

00:05:59,750  -->  00:06:02,380
So that's that's all great.

77

00:06:02,380  -->  00:06:07,900
That's exactly what we wanted to see to select for now.

78

00:06:07,900  -->  00:06:16,870
Bear in mind that you can of course select more sets as a starting point and then like more for a test

79

00:06:16,880  -->  00:06:17,590
or less.

80

00:06:17,590  -->  00:06:23,320
So up to you and this is just an example I'm just illustrating how you would go about it but I think

81

00:06:23,320  -->  00:06:27,230
in this case self 4 is sufficient for a demo test.

82

00:06:27,340  -->  00:06:33,070
And so that's what we'll go ahead with and we will just saved the reports so we have something to look

83

00:06:33,070  -->  00:06:34,520
at going forward.

84

00:06:34,630  -->  00:06:35,920
So let's slow them.

85

00:06:35,920  -->  00:06:36,370
OK.

86

00:06:36,380  -->  00:06:42,580
But the report to get through Paul will run it for the whole period of the back test plus forward tests

87

00:06:42,590  -->  00:06:44,900
so from May to September.

88

00:06:45,070  -->  00:06:46,840
So let's run that.

89

00:06:46,840  -->  00:06:48,440
These are these are chart.

90

00:06:48,500  -->  00:06:51,260
So go to report click save as report.

91

00:06:51,460  -->  00:07:03,160
And here we'll type in simple says version 5 point on and then set our equals 10.

92

00:07:03,760  -->  00:07:11,670
So just ... just copy this bit save this fit this browser window in here.

93

00:07:12,250  -->  00:07:14,930
So that's our report.

94

00:07:14,950  -->  00:07:20,930
You can see here it says open prices we can very quickly fix that will just go changes every tick.

95

00:07:20,950  -->  00:07:22,940
We know that will be exactly the same.

96

00:07:23,050  -->  00:07:25,600
Just take maybe a bit longer.

97

00:07:26,240  -->  00:07:27,630
There's a graph.

98

00:07:27,820  -->  00:07:29,470
So save as report.

99

00:07:29,820  -->  00:07:33,130
So it was the same one.

100

00:07:33,340  -->  00:07:34,730
There we go.

101

00:07:34,900  -->  00:07:36,830
That's our first one.

102

00:07:36,850  -->  00:07:45,770
Now if we go to settings and we load the second one for.

103

00:07:46,880  -->  00:07:48,970
OK.

104

00:07:49,150  -->  00:07:53,180
And so now we want to save this report.

105

00:07:53,180  -->  00:07:58,080
So it was a report it's going to be our for.

106

00:07:59,440  -->  00:08:00,600
I'm just going to close this one.

107

00:08:00,640  -->  00:08:06,460
So we have the 10 for now we'll go expert properties

108

00:08:09,380  -->  00:08:09,960
8

109

00:08:15,520  -->  00:08:18,400
7 report.

110

00:08:20,380  -->  00:08:23,550
And finally we want to save them and

111

00:08:30,890  -->  00:08:38,060
there also saved all four of them as the reports just going to zoom out a little bit.

112

00:08:38,060  -->  00:08:43,020
And now we can quickly compare which ones the best so this one was our turn.

113

00:08:43,050  -->  00:08:47,240
It's 4000 are our US 2000.

114

00:08:47,410  -->  00:08:50,090
This is two point thirty two point eight.

115

00:08:50,120  -->  00:08:53,200
And this one three point nine so that's the order that they're in.

116

00:08:53,200  -->  00:08:55,220
So this is the most profitable one.

117

00:08:55,660  -->  00:08:58,570
Our turn and we will call it the first set.

118

00:08:58,630  -->  00:09:02,490
This is the second profit the one where our is 9.

119

00:09:02,540  -->  00:09:09,440
We'll call the second set and this is the third one and where our was for this is the fifth the fourth

120

00:09:09,430  -->  00:09:10,090
one.

121

00:09:10,100  -->  00:09:12,770
So as you can see the charts are all pretty good.

122

00:09:13,450  -->  00:09:20,380
And now what we want to do is we want to launch these on a demo test to see how they will work online

123

00:09:20,410  -->  00:09:27,350
while they're running live and we will do that in the next tutorial and I'll explain you exactly how

124

00:09:27,350  -->  00:09:36,040
it's done and how exactly what's the best way to go about keeping a terminal's up and running 24/7.

125

00:09:36,040  -->  00:09:42,380
It'll be a very exciting couple of weeks while the Demel tests are running so I look forward to seeing

126

00:09:42,380  -->  00:09:43,440
you in the next tural.

127

00:09:43,480  -->  00:09:44,950
And until then happy trading
