00:00:06.520  -->  00:00:09.370
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.390  -->  00:00:15.480
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditative for today we're going to talk

3

00:00:15.480  -->  00:00:20.850
about rolling optimization and how it can benefit your algorithmic trading.

4

00:00:20.880  -->  00:00:26.070
Let's look at a scenario for example you've completed all your optimizations back tests and forward

5

00:00:26.070  -->  00:00:31.980
tests and you're ready to launch indemnities and then you're running them and assuming that you're happy

6

00:00:31.980  -->  00:00:40.410
with the results you launch real tests on a with a small account just to see how your expert advisor

7

00:00:40.830  -->  00:00:42.820
performs in real market conditions.

8

00:00:42.900  -->  00:00:48.870
Assuming you're happy with that you launch a large scale real account with the same set and at the start

9

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:53.620
everything is going well you're very happy with the results your can balance increasing.

10

00:00:53.880  -->  00:00:59.080
But unfortunately as we know nothing lasts for ever in this world.

11

00:00:59.250  -->  00:01:02.000
And at some point that happiness is going to come to an end.

12

00:01:02.010  -->  00:01:06.880
Because your expert advise is going to stop performing as well.

13

00:01:07.110  -->  00:01:12.510
And let's pause for a second to understand why that can happen that this can be the case for many reasons

14

00:01:12.510  -->  00:01:12.530
.

15

00:01:12.530  -->  00:01:20.490
For example the market may have changed or the market just entered a different cycle for example last

16

00:01:20.490  -->  00:01:26.760
cycle and expert adviser stopped making profits or their see if they can be seasonality effects.

17

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:36.300
For example if you're trading a currency that is somehow linked to a certain commodity which is seasonal

18

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:38.020
then that can affect your trade.

19

00:01:38.040  -->  00:01:44.630
There are many manufacturers out there that can prevent or change the circumstances in which our share

20

00:01:44.630  -->  00:01:50.250
rises trading and therefore lead it to start incurring losses.

21

00:01:50.250  -->  00:01:57.670
So at this stage this is when everything turns around and all your profits can diminish very quickly

22

00:01:57.670  -->  00:01:57.690
.

23

00:01:57.690  -->  00:01:59.730
So we want to preempt that one moment.

24

00:01:59.730  -->  00:02:06.030
We want to somehow protect ourselves from this happening.

25

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:08.070
And so let's do exactly that.

26

00:02:08.070  -->  00:02:13.160
Let's rewind a bit and go back to the day when you launch a large scale real account.

27

00:02:13.170  -->  00:02:20.070
Now you don't know when in the future this can occur like it can happen in a month it can happen in

28

00:02:22.650  -->  00:02:28.340
five months it can happen in a couple in a year when this turnaround will occur.

29

00:02:28.710  -->  00:02:33.300
Or maybe you and your expert advisor won't start making losses but it will start underperforming.

30

00:02:33.300  -->  00:02:34.860
It won't be performing as well.

31

00:02:34.860  -->  00:02:37.740
It will be making less profits.

32

00:02:37.740  -->  00:02:44.140
So that's something also to look out for because a lot of traders will think that since an expert advise

33

00:02:44.140  -->  00:02:45.470
is still making profits that's good.

34

00:02:45.480  -->  00:02:49.670
But if it's not performing as well as you expected it to.

35

00:02:49.710  -->  00:02:53.460
That actually means that something is going wrong and you have to look out for that as well.

36

00:02:53.490  -->  00:03:00.270
So you don't know when the future will happen but you know that most likely it will occur at some point

37

00:03:00.270  -->  00:03:00.300
.

38

00:03:00.300  -->  00:03:08.520
So what the best thing to do and what rolling optimization implies is planning in advance a period of

39

00:03:08.520  -->  00:03:12.630
time after which you will re optimize your expert advice.

40

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:22.020
So after the timeline goes past the second faded green cross what you will do or X market what you will

41

00:03:22.020  -->  00:03:29.340
do is you will run another optimization of your expert advisor or you run a precise optimization of

42

00:03:29.340  -->  00:03:33.990
the parameters you have run a few back tests and see how everything is going and see if you can actually

43

00:03:33.990  -->  00:03:38.420
improve the results that are being shown by expert advisor.

44

00:03:38.760  -->  00:03:46.880
And so when you get to that point in time the second green X on the timeline if you run the optimizations

45

00:03:46.890  -->  00:03:55.890
and forward tests again you may uncover that if you adjust your the set of your expert advises that

46

00:03:55.890  -->  00:04:03.240
you're currently using then you can improve the results or you can filter out additional losses that

47

00:04:03.240  -->  00:04:10.530
were that had been incurred in the previous couple of months where you can somehow upgrade the performance

48

00:04:10.530  -->  00:04:11.590
of the expert wise.

49

00:04:11.670  -->  00:04:16.540
So if you do uncover that in that shameful period then you just adjust your set.

50

00:04:16.560  -->  00:04:22.950
And that way you can avoid that loss on your account that we were talking about previously and that

51

00:04:22.950  -->  00:04:25.490
change in the behavior of expert advice.

52

00:04:25.500  -->  00:04:28.470
So why is it called rolling optimization.

53

00:04:28.620  -->  00:04:33.680
Well because throughout the process of the algorithmic trading you don't just set your expert adviser

54

00:04:33.690  -->  00:04:37.230
and let it run until the end of time.

55

00:04:37.230  -->  00:04:44.130
No you have to shingle and actually you run these optimizations and forward tests throughout the lifecycle

56

00:04:44.130  -->  00:04:49.880
of your trading system the way you shuffle them is it entirely depends on the system.

57

00:04:49.890  -->  00:04:51.950
Think of it in terms of.

58

00:04:52.050  -->  00:04:53.700
And this is the way I usually do it.

59

00:04:53.790  -->  00:05:00.360
Think of it in terms of cost benefit analysis like how much money is this expert advice bringing If

60

00:05:00.360  -->  00:05:01.220
it's a scalper.

61

00:05:01.230  -->  00:05:07.950
It can be bringing you know thousand dollar thousands of dollars per day than it is worth your while

62

00:05:07.950  -->  00:05:13.680
and worth your time to at the end of every day to sit down and really optimize expert wise and evaluate

63

00:05:13.680  -->  00:05:19.170
his performance for the day and see if you can upgrade its set somehow.

64

00:05:19.170  -->  00:05:27.690
If it's an hourly expert advisor is bringing you only maybe $50 a day then what is it going to be worth

65

00:05:27.690  -->  00:05:35.730
your while to spend that extra two hours of your time to really optimize maybe save $50 a day on average

66

00:05:35.820  -->  00:05:40.860
and then in four weeks in about a month you're going to get a thousand or so maybe it's worth your while

67

00:05:40.860  -->  00:05:44.400
to spend two hours a month to optimize this.

68

00:05:44.440  -->  00:05:50.310
In any case that is the approach I use and maybe that's something you would want to consider in terms

69

00:05:50.310  -->  00:05:53.420
of share pooling these optimizations in for tests.

70

00:05:53.490  -->  00:06:01.260
But certainly these they are something that has to be done throughout the lifecycle of your trading

71

00:06:01.260  -->  00:06:10.440
strategy and also that will help you identify the moment when your expert advisor has passed its due

72

00:06:10.440  -->  00:06:18.110
date because a lot of the systems out there they only work for a certain number of months or years.

73

00:06:18.150  -->  00:06:20.150
And that's the reality of things.

74

00:06:20.250  -->  00:06:25.980
Very rarely you will get a system that you will through optimization of constant optimization you will

75

00:06:25.980  -->  00:06:27.780
be able to maintain for a long time.

76

00:06:27.930  -->  00:06:34.710
Sometimes systems often systems only work for a year even through these optimizations for tests and

77

00:06:34.710  -->  00:06:39.140
then you will see that the performance is deteriorating.

78

00:06:39.540  -->  00:06:44.520
And regardless of how you're optimizing it that just means that that inefficiency in the market that

79

00:06:44.520  -->  00:06:50.580
you were exploiting has been uncovered by many more of the traders and it's time to move on it's time

80

00:06:50.580  -->  00:06:55.420
to get a new system in time to do all those optimizations.

81

00:06:55.440  -->  00:07:01.230
The only goal that we're chasing is that the profits that you make while the system is working that

82

00:07:01.230  -->  00:07:09.490
you're able to keep them and multiply them and then move onto the next system with those profits.

83

00:07:09.510  -->  00:07:13.950
So that's in a nutshell rolling optimization.

84

00:07:13.950  -->  00:07:19.770
I trust that you will take this into account and use this in your own trading strategies.

85

00:07:19.760  -->  00:07:29.130
It's a very useful method that can really protect your investments and returns that you've already made

86

00:07:29.130  -->  00:07:30.180
.

87

00:07:30.180  -->  00:07:31.080
Thank you very much.

88

00:07:31.080  -->  00:07:32.970
I look forward to seeing you next time.

89

00:07:32.970  -->  00:07:35.640
Until then try
