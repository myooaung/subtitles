00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:09,950
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,960  -->  00:00:14,510
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in Mediterranean 4.

3

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:19,110
I hope you're as excited about today's tutorial as I am because today we're finally going to tally up

4

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:21,820
the results of a four week demo test.

5

00:00:21,870  -->  00:00:24,780
I'm just going to bring up the calendar to show what day it is today.

6

00:00:25,110  -->  00:00:29,920
And today is Monday the 6th of October 2014.

7

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:36,330
As you recall we launched our Demel tests way back on Monday the 8th of September 2014.

8

00:00:36,390  -->  00:00:40,750
So that means that they have been running for a full four weeks.

9

00:00:40,910  -->  00:00:43,940
And so let's get straight into it.

10

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:48,540
Let's see what the results are and find out who the winner is.

11

00:00:48,540  -->  00:00:54,020
So here we've got simple system said one with our 10 as you remember.

12

00:00:54,030  -->  00:00:59,870
This was the most profitable set on our back test and forward test.

13

00:00:59,910  -->  00:01:05,330
However in the live demo tests we can see that it has been performing completely differently.

14

00:01:05,430  -->  00:01:10,290
It has actually created a loss on the count over the four week period of the demo test.

15

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:18,350
This set was able to lose so $151 and 98 cents and that's what a stun deposit of $5000.

16

00:01:18,360  -->  00:01:27,390
So this is definitely something that we would not consider putting on a large scale real account because

17

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:32,490
it's going to lose money and it's great that we found this out on the demo test because we would be

18

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:36,470
very disappointed to run into this on the real test.

19

00:01:36,540  -->  00:01:42,990
And that's a very good illustration of how sometimes back tests and for tests can show great results

20

00:01:42,990  -->  00:01:43,200
.

21

00:01:43,350  -->  00:01:50,430
But then the live demo test will actually uncover the truth before we move onto the next set I wanted

22

00:01:50,430  -->  00:01:51,590
to show you a couple of things.

23

00:01:51,590  -->  00:01:58,650
So if we're right click here and if we click last month then what you will see is that only the last

24

00:01:58,650  -->  00:02:00,460
month's trades will be displayed.

25

00:02:00,660  -->  00:02:06,690
And sometimes this is the default case and meditator for this way you're only seeing any trades that

26

00:02:06,690  -->  00:02:09,790
were conducted in the current month that you're in.

27

00:02:10,020  -->  00:02:15,300
If this is the case for you right now then all you have to do is right click and click all history to

28

00:02:15,300  -->  00:02:18,600
see all of the trades during this demo test.

29

00:02:18,750  -->  00:02:25,260
And a good checking point for this is if you look at the very top if the trades are sold by an order

30

00:02:26,370  -->  00:02:31,770
of there by the order number or by the time they were created you'll at the very top you should see

31

00:02:31,830  -->  00:02:37,540
a deposit on to your account that was the initial deposit on to your demo account.

32

00:02:37,560  -->  00:02:41,100
Or if it's a real account can do onto your real account.

33

00:02:41,280  -->  00:02:42,650
So that's a good control point.

34

00:02:42,660  -->  00:02:47,400
And because sometimes if it's sunset to last month it might be set to last three months or two custom

35

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:47,960
period.

36

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:51,880
So just make sure you click all history so you are seeing all of the trades.

37

00:02:52,230  -->  00:02:57,840
And the second thing I want to show you is sometimes the trades don't fit onto one full screen.

38

00:02:57,840  -->  00:03:02,840
So what you want to do is you right click and you click save as detailed report.

39

00:03:02,940  -->  00:03:05,480
You select a name for a report click save.

40

00:03:05,560  -->  00:03:06,800
Cook Yes.

41

00:03:06,840  -->  00:03:12,840
And what that will do is in all men trader for will convene and conveniently arrange all of your trades

42

00:03:13,230  -->  00:03:19,310
into a an HMO report just like with the back test and forward test.

43

00:03:19,320  -->  00:03:20,760
It's structured a little bit differently.

44

00:03:20,760  -->  00:03:22,830
The trees are on top and the stats are at the bottom.

45

00:03:22,850  -->  00:03:24,360
But the essence is the same.

46

00:03:24,510  -->  00:03:30,840
So here you can see all the trades on one convenient screen at the bottom you can see the chart and

47

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:34,640
you can see the stats so from this chart right away we can see what was going on.

48

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:35,760
At first it was losing.

49

00:03:35,760  -->  00:03:41,550
And then there was only two profitable big profitable trades and the rest were small losses on their

50

00:03:41,550  -->  00:03:42,160
count.

51

00:03:42,210  -->  00:03:46,430
And this is something we don't want to continue pursuing further.

52

00:03:46,650  -->  00:03:52,170
So having said that we're going to stop with this damage.

53

00:03:52,230  -->  00:03:53,480
We're not going to.

54

00:03:53,640  -->  00:03:58,350
This is definitely something that we're going to discard and we would never put some very close on to

55

00:03:58,370  -->  00:04:01,650
a large scale real account.

56

00:04:01,980  -->  00:04:09,420
So moving onto the next set set to where Ali was nine this was the second most profitable trade that

57

00:04:10,050  -->  00:04:12,870
we saw in the back test and forward test.

58

00:04:13,260  -->  00:04:19,020
And as you can see here it did yield a profit on their column a small profit of under 10 percent over

59

00:04:19,160  -->  00:04:21,080
a four week period.

60

00:04:21,090  -->  00:04:30,050
Also you can see that it's got quite a few very profitable trades and quite a lot of losses on the canso

61

00:04:31,240  -->  00:04:40,860
to investigate this further we would want to look at the report and see how the graph of this set was

62

00:04:40,860  -->  00:04:41,410
structured.

63

00:04:41,400  -->  00:04:42,360
So let's go ahead.

64

00:04:42,360  -->  00:04:44,940
I've already opened up the report here.

65

00:04:45,450  -->  00:04:50,820
As you can see the trends are also top and let's go down and look at the chart and maybe the stats.

66

00:04:50,880  -->  00:04:56,790
So here we can see that it's kind of like a sword shaped chart is going to go to a few trades going

67

00:04:58,110  -->  00:05:02,800
yielding losses on the column and then one profitable trade and then more losses and profitable.

68

00:05:02,850  -->  00:05:07,980
So it is kind of going up but this is not something that you'd want to consider.

69

00:05:07,980  -->  00:05:10,910
Like look at the profit factor it's one point fifteen.

70

00:05:11,040  -->  00:05:18,520
And as we will discuss further in the course we should aim for profit factors of 1.6 and above expected

71

00:05:18,600  -->  00:05:27,210
payoff is right it's $32 a net profit pro-trade maximal drawdown as 13 percent so that's something like

72

00:05:27,390  -->  00:05:31,650
you'd want to consider in making a decision.

73

00:05:31,710  -->  00:05:39,110
From my experience and my personality I wouldn't put such said on a large scale real account.

74

00:05:39,120  -->  00:05:46,200
However having said that it might be worth putting it on a small real account just to test it out in

75

00:05:46,200  -->  00:05:47,420
real market conditions.

76

00:05:47,430  -->  00:05:54,150
And maybe it will perform better or you will be able to confirm your opinion that you're not happy with

77

00:05:54,150  -->  00:05:54,910
this set.

78

00:05:54,930  -->  00:05:57,340
So it's kind of like in between.

79

00:05:57,600  -->  00:06:01,670
This particular set of simple system.

80

00:06:01,740  -->  00:06:10,170
All right so this one would gain a question mark and maybe it's where further investigation but maybe

81

00:06:10,170  -->  00:06:12,170
not depending on your personality.

82

00:06:12,180  -->  00:06:18,480
So moving on to the more interesting set set number three where our was for as you can see here we've

83

00:06:18,480  -->  00:06:20,330
got quite a lot of profitable trades.

84

00:06:20,340  -->  00:06:27,420
And it just makes you smile when you look at all of these trades on the constancy and the count and

85

00:06:27,420  -->  00:06:30,840
you can see these green tech profits and on the right.

86

00:06:30,840  -->  00:06:41,370
More importantly how much of the profits were as you can see there's a loss trade at the end which is

87

00:06:41,520  -->  00:06:48,390
justified because this happened on the last Friday of our DeMatteis and that happened to be the first

88

00:06:48,380  -->  00:06:49,610
Friday of October.

89

00:06:49,770  -->  00:06:58,440
And as we know every month on the first Friday of every month the U.S. releases non-farm payrolls and

90

00:06:58,500  -->  00:07:04,980
unemployment news that news may have affected our pattern and what we were used to seeing was the pattern

91

00:07:04,980  -->  00:07:07,270
that this expert advisors after.

92

00:07:07,410  -->  00:07:12,170
So usually I don't trade on the very first Friday of every month.

93

00:07:12,210  -->  00:07:22,470
And you can learn more about that and how to though in other ways protect your system from these external

94

00:07:22,470  -->  00:07:22,970
factors.

95

00:07:22,970  -->  00:07:27,390
In my other course that I've planned I haven't started it yet but I'm planning on starting it.

96

00:07:27,380  -->  00:07:33,110
It will be a course on strategy designed for the Forex market so look out for that maybe check for ex-beau

97

00:07:33,130  -->  00:07:37,860
dotcom from time to time to see when I really set course and that's something I'll definitely talk about

98

00:07:37,860  -->  00:07:38,870
there.

99

00:07:39,070  -->  00:07:44,850
But going back to our set as he can see this set yielded three thousand one hundred forty one dollars

100

00:07:44,880  -->  00:07:51,840
and 50 cents of pure profit from a deposit of $5000 in the space of four weeks.

101

00:07:51,930  -->  00:07:56,290
So that some 62 percent profit in 4 weeks.

102

00:07:56,310  -->  00:07:57,500
It's incredible.

103

00:07:57,500  -->  00:08:00,670
It's unbelievable it's something that you don't see often.

104

00:08:00,870  -->  00:08:09,060
And this is something that is definitely worth considering putting onto a live a real minea account

105

00:08:09,090  -->  00:08:15,660
just for testing it out first in real market conditions and then maybe moving it onto a large scale

106

00:08:15,660  -->  00:08:16,510
real account.

107

00:08:16,710  -->  00:08:22,200
So let's have a look at the results in the form of a report.

108

00:08:22,230  -->  00:08:23,720
So I've got this report here.

109

00:08:23,850  -->  00:08:27,460
And as you can see all these trades are up at the top.

110

00:08:27,750  -->  00:08:33,520
And here we've got our chart which is an amazing chart.

111

00:08:33,720  -->  00:08:40,700
And of course you always have these losses on your count which occur from time to time and are inevitable

112

00:08:40,710  -->  00:08:40,910
.

113

00:08:41,070  -->  00:08:43,760
But as will discuss further in the course.

114

00:08:43,790  -->  00:08:48,340
Good systems are able to get out of them quicker than bad systems.

115

00:08:48,380  -->  00:08:55,430
And also you should look at other factors like in this case profit factious 365 which is more than double

116

00:08:55,440  -->  00:09:02,420
the recommended 1.6 expected payoff is incredible $241 net profit per trade.

117

00:09:02,420  -->  00:09:07,730
So it's it's got a lot of good stuff to it like maximal drawdown is only seven point eighteen percent

118

00:09:07,740  -->  00:09:10,680
so that's under 10 percent of maximal drawdown.

119

00:09:10,670  -->  00:09:11,930
I think this is a great set.

120

00:09:11,940  -->  00:09:15,610
I think it's something that we would definitely consider taking forward.

121

00:09:15,810  -->  00:09:22,980
And so this set receives a good grade golden star for its performance on the four week test.

122

00:09:22,990  -->  00:09:29,570
I remind you that it's four weeks because that means we've got a substantial number of trades to have

123

00:09:29,880  -->  00:09:32,240
significant results that we can consider.

124

00:09:32,630  -->  00:09:37,580
And finally moving on to simple systems set for where our WAS 8 here.

125

00:09:37,640  -->  00:09:44,950
We've got another incredible said where most of the trades were profitable.

126

00:09:45,070  -->  00:09:48,740
In fact all the trades except for one were proffered on just trying to.

127

00:09:49,090  -->  00:09:49,620
There we go.

128

00:09:49,620  -->  00:09:56,040
So here it's just amazing looking at these take profits all the trades that were on this account were

129

00:09:56,040  -->  00:09:56,660
profitable.

130

00:09:56,700  -->  00:09:57,510
Last one.

131

00:09:57,620  -->  00:10:02,370
And as we've discussed this may have been affected by non-farm payrolls and unemployment.

132

00:10:02,460  -->  00:10:09,990
But nevertheless the said yielded 1400 and 10 dollars of pure profit on a deposit of $5000 in the space

133

00:10:09,990  -->  00:10:13,390
of four weeks which is 28 percent profit.

134

00:10:13,430  -->  00:10:16,930
So let's jump to the report and have a look at that.

135

00:10:17,220  -->  00:10:24,080
Here we've got those profitable trades and an amazing incredible chart just going up up up and then

136

00:10:24,090  -->  00:10:29,750
maybe a loss and hopefully if this were to continue it would be going up up up again.

137

00:10:29,750  -->  00:10:38,480
Let's look at the stats profit factor is 324 three point twenty four which is just more than double

138

00:10:38,490  -->  00:10:40,230
the recommended 1.6.

139

00:10:40,230  -->  00:10:47,740
Expect to pay off his $108 net profit per trade maximal drawdown is still under 10 percent so it's just

140

00:10:48,000  -->  00:10:51,170
just under 9 percent which is a very good result.

141

00:10:51,170  -->  00:10:57,810
So this is another set that we would definitely consider taking forward putting on a live real account

142

00:10:57,880  -->  00:10:58,170
.

143

00:10:58,380  -->  00:11:06,270
Real account just for testing it in real market conditions were real money and then moving on to a large

144

00:11:06,270  -->  00:11:07,510
scale real account.

145

00:11:07,770  -->  00:11:13,440
So this said risk is another golden star great said great performance very happy will fit.

146

00:11:13,530  -->  00:11:16,050
This sums up our demo test.

147

00:11:16,110  -->  00:11:24,140
It was a great four week run and I'm really glad that we got this kind of mix of sets and you saw how

148

00:11:24,140  -->  00:11:30,600
profitable sets on there were profitable and back to us and forward as can turn out to be to create

149

00:11:30,600  -->  00:11:37,440
losses on real accounts how you've got other assets that can perform really well and they've got a good

150

00:11:37,430  -->  00:11:43,350
mix of trades and they've got quite a lot of entries into the market over this period.

151

00:11:43,380  -->  00:11:44,690
So that was great fun.

152

00:11:44,700  -->  00:11:52,470
I'm really happy that you got to see all of this and see how a demo test should be conducted to make

153

00:11:52,470  -->  00:12:00,030
sure that what you are taking forward is a reliable reliable sets for your expert Yser in the next couple

154

00:12:00,030  -->  00:12:04,280
of tutorials you'll see how to conduct a real test with real money.

155

00:12:04,290  -->  00:12:11,860
And I'll remind you that I'm putting $500 of my own money on the line just to see how this expert advisor

156

00:12:11,880  -->  00:12:14,220

157

00:12:14,220  -->  00:12:16,310

158

00:12:16,530  -->  00:12:19,070
