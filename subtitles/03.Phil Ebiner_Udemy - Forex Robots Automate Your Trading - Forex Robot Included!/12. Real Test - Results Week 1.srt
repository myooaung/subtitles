00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:09,500
Hello there's a kernel from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,510  -->  00:00:16,800
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in megatrend for it has been one week since

3

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:20,460
we launched our real test of simple system version 5.0.

4

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:23,440
And let's check into see how it's going.

5

00:00:23,760  -->  00:00:31,260
So first of all as Bring on the calendar and here you'll see that there's a 20 it's off September 2014

6

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:31,650
.

7

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:36,690
We launched the real test on Monday the 22nd Tembo of 2014.

8

00:00:36,720  -->  00:00:42,450
So the real test has been running for one full working week.

9

00:00:42,630  -->  00:00:45,850
Now going back let's look at the results.

10

00:00:45,980  -->  00:00:50,680
If I'd like to ask you to add the comments call them over here.

11

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:53,990
And so in order to do that I'll just take it out.

12

00:00:54,420  -->  00:01:01,320
All you have to do is right click anywhere in the account history tab and choose comments and you'll

13

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:04,160
see that simple system version 5.0 is quite smart.

14

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:12,150
It actually puts in a common saying which of the simple system expert advisors set this order so you

15

00:01:12,150  -->  00:01:19,470
have multiple them running like I do on this terminal you'll be able to understand which one belongs

16

00:01:19,470  -->  00:01:21,730
to which order.

17

00:01:21,870  -->  00:01:23,390
So that's that's quite handy.

18

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:30,420
However in our case we will be also using the size of the lot to differentiate between them and I'll

19

00:01:30,420  -->  00:01:32,770
just show you how to do that in a minute.

20

00:01:32,790  -->  00:01:41,400
So so far you can see that after the first week our balance initial balance of 500 has gone up very

21

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:44,320
likely only up to 500 point fifty.

22

00:01:44,380  -->  00:01:47,480
So you can't even consider that as an increase.

23

00:01:47,510  -->  00:01:52,680
What we're more interested though is in the individual trades to understand what was happening.

24

00:01:52,830  -->  00:02:00,480
So as you can see here you've got we've got quite a few take profits quite a few stop losses and there

25

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:07,980
are quite a few trades here and that's because we had three versions of expert advisors running with

26

00:02:07,980  -->  00:02:15,240
three different sets as you can recall what how we could analyze is we could look through these.

27

00:02:15,240  -->  00:02:22,900
And right away could look at the stop loss we can see that it's 0.02 to zero point zero to lots so the

28

00:02:22,950  -->  00:02:25,360
hour was 10 hours 10 and the last one.

29

00:02:25,360  -->  00:02:29,710
Our sense of the stop losses were incurred by the same set.

30

00:02:29,760  -->  00:02:38,780
And that's the set that has our turn here but it had our 9 back in the demo.

31

00:02:38,850  -->  00:02:46,140
So that's that said over there on the top our right there we were running the one that is currently

32

00:02:46,860  -->  00:02:48,020
quite unstable.

33

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:55,010
So instead of analyzing these trades one by one what I like doing is I just like storing the

34

00:02:58,020  -->  00:03:06,360
historical trades by size and that is a very handy thing you can do especially if you've allocated different

35

00:03:06,420  -->  00:03:14,480
lots to the different versions of your expert adviser or the different expert advisors are testing.

36

00:03:14,700  -->  00:03:18,290
And that quickly allows you to differentiate between them.

37

00:03:18,300  -->  00:03:22,660
So right away I can see here that the first trades are here.

38

00:03:22,770  -->  00:03:27,630
The point one belong to the simple system where our was five.

39

00:03:27,630  -->  00:03:32,040
So in the one test that's the one we're always for and that's the one on the left or bottom left that's

40

00:03:32,580  -->  00:03:36,090
the one that was really good in the demo test and it has been so far.

41

00:03:36,390  -->  00:03:43,020
But as you recall we put it we gave it a lot because we weren't sure that the demo test results would

42

00:03:43,320  -->  00:03:46,080
be the same as the real test results.

43

00:03:46,260  -->  00:03:52,740
And then the point to laut is the one that's quite unstable and a demo test and we didn't know that

44

00:03:52,740  -->  00:04:01,750
at the time of launching them a real test so we thought that maybe we'll get Point to Point Zero two

45

00:04:01,830  -->  00:04:04,470
a lot because it's got some potential.

46

00:04:04,530  -->  00:04:08,040
And Point 3 of a lot is a there or three of a lot.

47

00:04:08,040  -->  00:04:15,240
Is the test that said that had no lost trades on the demo test.

48

00:04:15,360  -->  00:04:19,810
And as you can see here is got one last trade but which wasn't a stop loss which was a time out.

49

00:04:19,950  -->  00:04:21,680
So let's analyze them separately.

50

00:04:21,840  -->  00:04:27,430
So this first on over here as you can see the results are quite good too if we take these top trades

51

00:04:27,960  -->  00:04:34,980
there's a loss but then it's covered by the profits so in total this try this said was profitable on

52

00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:36,280
the real test.

53

00:04:36,500  -->  00:04:43,110
The next set are here it was unprofitable so only one good trade and three bad ones.

54

00:04:43,110  -->  00:04:45,580
And that doesn't balance out.

55

00:04:45,590  -->  00:04:50,030
So so far this hasn't been doing well.

56

00:04:50,040  -->  00:04:55,460
And finally the point 0 3 of a lot has been very good.

57

00:04:55,500  -->  00:05:02,160
So for this time down trade and that's that's a good example of a discrepancy so we can see this trade

58

00:05:02,160  -->  00:05:07,890
here it created a loss on that count but there wasn't one in the demo test and the that DeMatteis all

59

00:05:07,890  -->  00:05:09,450
of them are profitable.

60

00:05:09,510  -->  00:05:15,510
So that some that's once again a good example of how a demo test can be different to a real test even

61

00:05:15,510  -->  00:05:18,700
when you run them in parallel at the same time.

62

00:05:19,500  -->  00:05:28,500
So first thing that comes into mind is that you'd want to take this set off your test and like exclude

63

00:05:28,510  -->  00:05:36,530
this set from the further test and your real account because it's doing so badly.

64

00:05:36,840  -->  00:05:44,430
But I just wanted to use this tutorial as an example of one how you handle these kind of psychological

65

00:05:44,430  -->  00:05:51,960
dilemmas because in reality what we're testing here is we're not trying to get all of them together

66

00:05:51,960  -->  00:05:55,050
to work really well and create a profit on our account.

67

00:05:55,190  -->  00:06:02,700
What we are doing is we're using this account of 500 dollars to run a real test of each one of these

68

00:06:02,700  -->  00:06:05,670
expert advisors and we want to analyze them separately.

69

00:06:05,880  -->  00:06:15,900
So instead of trying to get a community of good outcome what we want to do right now is we want to give

70

00:06:15,900  -->  00:06:18,750
them some time and see how they'll go individually.

71

00:06:18,750  -->  00:06:28,060
So maybe at the end of next week when we've got all of we've got like five more days of are dotted and

72

00:06:28,070  -->  00:06:34,730
analyzed We'll look at this expert advice and will say oh OK so in two weeks this guy that's where this

73

00:06:34,740  -->  00:06:41,310
set this training with 0.02 lots where our stand has overall had a very bad run.

74

00:06:41,310  -->  00:06:49,290
So then we'll say OK no we won't put him on our actual real account where we don't test things or we

75

00:06:49,290  -->  00:06:50,260
actually try.

76

00:06:50,490  -->  00:06:53,150
And so we'll analyze them separately anyway.

77

00:06:53,160  -->  00:07:01,530
And you have to kind of withstand the urge to make alterations to a test because once you've launched

78

00:07:01,530  -->  00:07:09,270
them you should give them some time to have enough momentum build up enough momentum so that you can

79

00:07:09,270  -->  00:07:16,010
actually analyze the results were from quite quite a good level of certainty.

80

00:07:16,290  -->  00:07:21,090
And another thing that might come into mind is to change a lot say this one's done really well let's

81

00:07:21,090  -->  00:07:23,370
put up its Laud's this one is doing better than we thought.

82

00:07:23,370  -->  00:07:29,940
Let's put up its lots and let's put down the LOTS of this one we can do that but I won't in this case

83

00:07:29,970  -->  00:07:34,160
because it's very convenient to sort by last like this and analyze them.

84

00:07:34,200  -->  00:07:40,190
And if we changed a lot then they'll be jumbled around and it will be hard to find them.

85

00:07:40,200  -->  00:07:45,990
And what we will have to do is then will have to copy all of this history ex-porn and check sell and

86

00:07:45,990  -->  00:07:52,090
then use this comment section to sort our trades and find the right ones.

87

00:07:52,110  -->  00:07:57,930
So we'll just stick to the easier option we'll keep the lots different and that's primarily why we've

88

00:07:58,020  -->  00:08:04,290
said what's different so that we can now we can sort them and find the right traits for our analysis

89

00:08:04,770  -->  00:08:10,590
and we'll just keep the lots the same for one more week and see how it goes at the end of next week

90

00:08:10,620  -->  00:08:12,680
and then analyze the results then.

91

00:08:12,960  -->  00:08:16,320
So that's how our real test is going so far.

92

00:08:16,320  -->  00:08:21,600
I hope you're finding it really interesting because personally I'm very excited about all of this and

93

00:08:21,600  -->  00:08:26,130
it's been a great demo Plus real test combination.

94

00:08:26,460  -->  00:08:30,890
Let's wait and see what happens next week and I look forward to seeing the next tutorial.

95

00:08:30,900  -->  00:08:32,240
Until then have training
