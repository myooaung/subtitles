Hello this is curial for Expo dot com.

3

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:14.140
And welcome to the seventh tutorial in the course on testing and optimization and meditate.

4

00:00:14.150  -->  00:00:17.040
For now we know what a back test is.

5

00:00:17.040  -->  00:00:24.630
It's time to find out what a forward test is because the fines for retesting as the repeated run of

6

00:00:24.630  -->  00:00:27.840
the best optimization results on a different time period.

7

00:00:27.900  -->  00:00:32.960
Such a possibility allows us to eliminate the fitting of parameters on certain history data.

8

00:00:33.300  -->  00:00:36.840
So let's have a look at what this really means.

9

00:00:37.040  -->  00:00:44.070
Let's do a timeline and let's set a point for each day as we did previously.

10

00:00:44.070  -->  00:00:52.740
Now let's choose a period between two dates when we will be testing our system this time instead of

11

00:00:52.740  -->  00:00:55.210
conducting the back test on the whole period.

12

00:00:55.230  -->  00:00:58.230
We will split our period into two.

13

00:00:58.490  -->  00:01:01.910
The first one on the left here and then there's a second on the right.

14

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:08.190
So the first one we will use to conduct back tests and run optimizations of our system so basically

15

00:01:08.190  -->  00:01:15.690
we will train the algorithmic trading system on this daughter or we're here but we won't be touching

16

00:01:16.020  -->  00:01:17.490
this bit at all.

17

00:01:17.490  -->  00:01:25.020
At this stage then once we've come up with a set or several sets of profitable parameters for a system

18

00:01:25.320  -->  00:01:30.750
then we will use those parameters to run forward tests on this bit over here.

19

00:01:30.930  -->  00:01:38.190
And what that allows us to do is as medico's suggests that allows us to avoid curve fitting meaning

20

00:01:38.190  -->  00:01:44.640
that when we run the back test and the whole of the data that we've chosen for the testing purposes

21

00:01:44.970  -->  00:01:52.580
we could end up with a set of parameters that is profitable but will only work on that period of data

22

00:01:52.590  -->  00:01:58.080
so when we launch it in the future or when you launch today it won't bring us profits in the future

23

00:01:58.710  -->  00:02:07.710
and to avoid that what we're doing is we're saving this little bit of our daughter for the forward test

24

00:02:07.740  -->  00:02:13.140
and then we're using this majority of our daughter to conduct back tests and optimizations and come

25

00:02:13.140  -->  00:02:20.040
up with profitable parameters and once that's done we want to check these parameters on this independent

26

00:02:20.120  -->  00:02:28.230
dadda and if on this independent data the parameters also show profitable results then that means that

27

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:33.890
the expert adviser wasn't curve fitted to this data over here.

28

00:02:33.900  -->  00:02:42.720
And therefore those parameters are generally profitable and we have a higher sense of security if we're

29

00:02:42.720  -->  00:02:47.370
going to launch these parameters today to make profits in the future.

30

00:02:47.370  -->  00:02:52.710
From my experience I recommend splitting the data into a ratio of three to one.

31

00:02:52.740  -->  00:02:58.740
So you would use three portions to get back to us and you just one portion to do your forward.

32

00:02:58.770  -->  00:03:07.730
So basically for every three months over back to two Jews a month over forward test as a ballpoint mark

33

00:03:07.730  -->  00:03:07.760
.

34

00:03:07.770  -->  00:03:14.000
But that can vary depending on the system and depending on the data that you have available to you.

35

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:19.950
So that's basically it that's what a forward test is and we'll run a few of these forward tests in the

36

00:03:19.950  -->  00:03:26.070
next section of our course when we're practicing the knowledge that we've learned in this section.

37

00:03:26.460  -->  00:03:30.560
And when we're working with simple system expert advisor.

38

00:03:30.900  -->  00:03:32.460
So that's it for today's tutorial.

39

00:03:32.460  -->  00:03:34.320
I look forward to seeing you next time.

40

00:03:34.320  -->  00:03:37.990
And until then Happy training.
