00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:09.790
Hello this is Carol for boat dot com.

2

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:16.230
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditator for the previous tutorial we

3

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:18.260
talked about the recovery factor.

4

00:00:18.330  -->  00:00:25.980
And today I will give you some recommendations around which parameters you should focus on when optimizing

5

00:00:25.980  -->  00:00:28.320
your systems in Medicare for.

6

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:34.380
So the three main parameters that you should be looking at are the profit factor the drawdown and the

7

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:35.800
recovery factor.

8

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:46.170
And the main rule of thumb is for you to look for a profit factor above 1.6 a drawdown of under 15 percent

9

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:49.400
and the recovery factor of above 2.

10

00:00:49.530  -->  00:00:56.100
And in terms of drawdown if you have very risk averse you can lower this to 10 percent so you'd be looking

11

00:00:56.100  -->  00:01:05.950
for a system to have a maximal drawdown of 10 percent or if you're a risk seeking then you could increase

12

00:01:05.950  -->  00:01:07.920
this up to 30 percent.

13

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:14.010
It all depends on what kind of person you are and what kind of risks you're comfortable with.

14

00:01:14.010  -->  00:01:21.900
Also you'll find that these three parameters and their values come up a lot in discussions on different

15

00:01:21.900  -->  00:01:30.170
forums forums of about X and in the research papers from academia and even from live trading.

16

00:01:30.300  -->  00:01:37.530
And what they mean is that if a system does follow these parameters then it can be considered more or

17

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:45.450
less stable and that doesn't mean necessarily that this system will always be profitable nor does that

18

00:01:45.450  -->  00:01:49.890
mean that systems that don't follow this rule are not profitable.

19

00:01:49.890  -->  00:01:56.920
You can always find a system that is not in line of any of these rules but it still yields result in

20

00:01:56.990  -->  00:01:57.660
good results.

21

00:01:57.660  -->  00:02:07.530
But what this does mean is that youre more likely to get good results from a system that follows these

22

00:02:08.730  -->  00:02:13.270
criteria and that your results are more likely to be consistent.

23

00:02:13.440  -->  00:02:22.340
So it is advisable to try to optimize your systems in a way that you achieve this criteria.

24

00:02:22.560  -->  00:02:27.530
So lets go back to our sewer system which is simple system or in 5.0.

25

00:02:27.540  -->  00:02:37.500
And look at this on an example here in front of us I have the exported optimization results which we

26

00:02:37.500  -->  00:02:42.650
put into excel in the previous tutorial I've highlighted the three parameters that we're looking at

27

00:02:42.660  -->  00:02:52.020
the profit factor of the drawdown in terms of percent and the recovery factor which we calculated ourselves

28

00:02:52.260  -->  00:02:58.710
which we introduced as formula in the previous tutorial because this parameter is not calculated and

29

00:02:58.710  -->  00:03:00.380
meditate for.

30

00:03:00.420  -->  00:03:08.300
So now we want to find the BAC tests that fit the criteria looking for.

31

00:03:08.610  -->  00:03:14.340
So for starters we will highlight the ones that we don't like and to do that we'll select the column

32

00:03:14.400  -->  00:03:21.030
we'll click conditional formatting will highlight cells and we'll highlight all the cells that are less

33

00:03:21.030  -->  00:03:21.590
than.

34

00:03:21.750  -->  00:03:27.150
And here we're going to type in 1.6 because that's what we're looking for then we'll do the same thing

35

00:03:27.150  -->  00:03:27.990
for drawdown.

36

00:03:27.990  -->  00:03:34.500
We'll highlight Sellersburg we'll highlight cells that are greater than and in this case we want all

37

00:03:34.500  -->  00:03:37.000
the cells that are greater than 15 percent.

38

00:03:37.070  -->  00:03:40.650
OK I'm just gonna copy the format here.

39

00:03:41.100  -->  00:03:44.310
And finally same thing for the recovery factor.

40

00:03:44.430  -->  00:03:49.510
Conditional Formatting highlights cells that are less than 2.

41

00:03:50.040  -->  00:03:58.170
So if we scroll down you will see the red cells are the ones that don't fit the criteria and therefore

42

00:03:58.170  -->  00:04:05.910
the associated back tests or sets of parameters are presenting those back Tests should probably not

43

00:04:05.910  -->  00:04:11.570
be considered for a demo or or specialty live real training.

44

00:04:11.760  -->  00:04:18.810
So as you can see as we scroll down because these results are ordered by profit the number of red is

45

00:04:18.810  -->  00:04:22.830
increasing and so far we haven't had a huge drawdowns by 15 percent.

46

00:04:23.160  -->  00:04:28.770
But there we go there's the first one and now they start coming up.

47

00:04:28.770  -->  00:04:34.140
So if we keep scrolling down you'll see the amount of bread is increasing more and more and more until

48

00:04:34.470  -->  00:04:41.760
we don't have any stable results at this point and at this stage at all and then when you get to the

49

00:04:41.760  -->  00:04:45.190
negatives the read is just everywhere.

50

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:51.690
So next what we want to do is we want to exclude these completely from our analysis so they don't clutter

51

00:04:52.320  -->  00:04:54.890
this report and want to do that.

52

00:04:54.900  -->  00:05:03.810
We can select the ribbon up here or the first row and we'll click Dadda click filter which will add

53

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:05.050
a filter to this row.

54

00:05:05.210  -->  00:05:07.060
And now we're just going to filter them out.

55

00:05:07.260  -->  00:05:12.900
And it's very easily done if you go to if you click on this button over here for the filter you go to

56

00:05:12.900  -->  00:05:14.520
number filters.

57

00:05:14.520  -->  00:05:17.610
And up here you want to leave only the good ones.

58

00:05:17.610  -->  00:05:21.010
So we want greater than or equal to.

59

00:05:21.120  -->  00:05:24.320
And here we want to type in 1.6 click OK.

60

00:05:24.420  -->  00:05:27.180
So as you can see all the red ones have been taken out.

61

00:05:27.180  -->  00:05:34.680
Same thing we want to do for the drawdown number filters less than we want to even do less than or equal

62

00:05:34.680  -->  00:05:39.550
to just one less than 15 percent click OK.

63

00:05:39.780  -->  00:05:48.140
And finally recovery factor number filters we want greater than or equal two to two.

64

00:05:48.320  -->  00:05:57.210
And as you can see we've removed all of the red and we're left with a very limited number of results

65

00:05:57.210  -->  00:05:57.620
.

66

00:05:57.780  -->  00:06:05.190
And here we can see that we have a total at the bottom if we look we have a total of 49 left out of

67

00:06:05.240  -->  00:06:07.380
the three thousand nine hundred seventy one.

68

00:06:07.410  -->  00:06:14.820
So Excel exporting daughter to excel and analyzing it just just through these three parameters allows

69

00:06:14.820  -->  00:06:17.440
you to significantly reduce the number.

70

00:06:17.450  -->  00:06:23.190
The amount of manual work that you have to do now you only have 49 out of three thousand eight hundred

71

00:06:23.220  -->  00:06:24.100
seventy one.

72

00:06:24.340  -->  00:06:30.300
If you really wanted to you could run all these Forty-Niners back tests and actually look at the charts

73

00:06:30.810  -->  00:06:38.070
and pick out one that you like the most and you'll know that in terms of the three parameter criteria

74

00:06:38.900  -->  00:06:40.750
it's more likely to be stable.

75

00:06:40.920  -->  00:06:46.360
And plus you've actually visually analyzed the rest of them so you know that that is the one.

76

00:06:46.370  -->  00:06:47.240
Exactly.

77

00:06:47.520  -->  00:06:49.730
So let's have a look at one fruit for instance.

78

00:06:49.740  -->  00:06:52.950
And out of them.

79

00:06:53.520  -->  00:06:57.010
Well let's have a look.

80

00:06:57.390  -->  00:07:04.560
For example this one this one kind of stands out just as an example that it is not the top one but it

81

00:07:04.560  -->  00:07:08.150
does have a profit factor more than the top one.

82

00:07:08.270  -->  00:07:14.460
It does have a relatively small drawdown and good recovery factor above 2 and it still has a high number

83

00:07:14.460  -->  00:07:15.210
of traits.

84

00:07:15.210  -->  00:07:16.410
So let's look at that one.

85

00:07:16.440  -->  00:07:19.730
We just have to remember the pause is 1 4 7 7.

86

00:07:19.740  -->  00:07:26.580
Now if we go back to Ameritrade for optimization results there it is still ordered by profit and you

87

00:07:26.580  -->  00:07:33.150
can find right here 1 4 7 7 if you can find it just order by pass and then search for it.

88

00:07:33.190  -->  00:07:38.910
But just scrolling down you will be able to locate it easily said input parameters to start optimization

89

00:07:38.910  -->  00:07:39.150
.

90

00:07:39.150  -->  00:07:39.990
Look at the graph.

91

00:07:39.990  -->  00:07:47.060
So and if you like the graph then maybe you should consider this set of parameters for your demo test

92

00:07:47.070  -->  00:07:55.980
a real test what else you can do now is that you can maybe do some further analysis and maybe take out

93

00:07:55.980  -->  00:08:04.560
the mid limit that you don't like say if you don't like 10 or you don't like 9 8 7 6 all of those then

94

00:08:04.620  -->  00:08:06.930
you'll be left with small mean limits.

95

00:08:06.930  -->  00:08:15.870
You can analyze other parameters or you can even make the criteria more stringent so greater than or

96

00:08:15.870  -->  00:08:19.530
equal to because remember the 1.6 value is a minimum.

97

00:08:19.530  -->  00:08:21.270
So how about we set that to 2.

98

00:08:21.290  -->  00:08:25.210
We set the profit factor to be at least two.

99

00:08:25.440  -->  00:08:33.650
And then we set the recovery factor to be at least 4 4 for instance or double the required minimum.

100

00:08:33.690  -->  00:08:40.150
Right away we're left with only 4 optimization results that fit this criteria.

101

00:08:40.380  -->  00:08:48.180
And as you can see the expected payoff here is very good it's around 60 or $80 mark.

102

00:08:48.210  -->  00:08:51.260
So that's per trade net profit per trade.

103

00:08:51.300  -->  00:08:55.270
Profit Factor is great drawdowns very low recurring factor is great.

104

00:08:55.450  -->  00:09:02.400
So and all it took us less than 5 minutes to come up with these results out of these four results out

105

00:09:02.400  -->  00:09:04.710
of three thousand nine hundred seventy one record.

106

00:09:04.890  -->  00:09:13.320
And that just shows how you can very quickly to get rid of all this manual work and just come up with

107

00:09:13.320  -->  00:09:20.450
the best results by analyzing your optimization output.

108

00:09:20.460  -->  00:09:22.270
So I think that's enough for today.

109

00:09:22.620  -->  00:09:24.220
Have a play around with that.

110

00:09:24.330  -->  00:09:30.210
I hope it's all pretty straightforward if you do have any questions please let me know I'm always glad

111

00:09:30.210  -->  00:09:33.330
to assist you and help you out in the next tutorial.

112

00:09:33.330  -->  00:09:38.280
We will talk about the genetic algorithms so be quite an interesting one.

113

00:09:38.640  -->  00:09:40.280
And I look forward to seeing you there.

114

00:09:40.410  -->  00:09:43.720
Until next time happy training.
