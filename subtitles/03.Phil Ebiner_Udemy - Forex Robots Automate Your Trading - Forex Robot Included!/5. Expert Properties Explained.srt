00:00:07,590  -->  00:00:09,760
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,790  -->  00:00:15,190
And welcome to the fourth tutorial in our series of tutorials on testing and optimization and meditate

3

00:00:15,200  -->  00:00:16,040
for.

4

00:00:16,050  -->  00:00:22,470
Last time we talked about backtesting and we conducted our very own first back test in the meditator

5

00:00:22,830  -->  00:00:24,330
for training platform.

6

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:30,810
Today we're going to discuss expert properties as you can see here I have the meditator four platform

7

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:36,990
open in front of me at the bottom I have the tester strategy tester window open.

8

00:00:36,990  -->  00:00:42,730
Now what we can do is we're going to just select any expert adviser of the available ones and we'll

9

00:00:42,730  -->  00:00:46,020
just click this button up here expert properties.

10

00:00:46,020  -->  00:00:53,600
So these are the expert properties expert properties settings window and has three tabs right away I'll

11

00:00:53,610  -->  00:00:59,100
mention that we won't be talking about optimization type today we'll be talking about optimization parameters

12

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:01,830
in one of the future toils in this course.

13

00:01:01,830  -->  00:01:05,300
Today we're going to be talking about these two taps in the testing tab.

14

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:11,850
You can see some some controls which are responsible for the overall test parameters so they're not

15

00:01:11,850  -->  00:01:15,450
specific to the expert advisor you'll see these controls.

16

00:01:15,660  -->  00:01:20,770
You'll see that these controls are the same regardless of which expert adviser you are testing.

17

00:01:20,820  -->  00:01:26,910
And here you can set a starting deposit which means the balance on your count at the start of the test

18

00:01:27,280  -->  00:01:34,410
the account currents and usually people set the currents to match the currency on their actual real

19

00:01:35,160  -->  00:01:43,080
live trading account and you can also set which kind of positions you you want cheer for X robot to

20

00:01:43,080  -->  00:01:43,950
be able to open.

21

00:01:43,950  -->  00:01:50,730
So regardless of the algorithm which is built into your trading system you can restrict the extra effort

22

00:01:50,730  -->  00:01:51,850
from opening.

23

00:01:51,870  -->  00:01:52,950
Say sell orders.

24

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:59,040
And that way if you choose long only the trading strategy will be restricted to opening only by orders

25

00:01:59,070  -->  00:02:06,080
or so on the other hand you can restrict it to opening only sellers by selecting short only.

26

00:02:06,380  -->  00:02:12,230
Normally this is rarely used and people tend to stick to both long and short.

27

00:02:12,240  -->  00:02:17,340
But in some circumstances circumstances this control might be might come in handy.

28

00:02:17,340  -->  00:02:19,320
So it's good to know that it's there.

29

00:02:19,320  -->  00:02:21,220
So we'll leave this had long short.

30

00:02:21,300  -->  00:02:26,370
Once again we won't be talking about optimization in this tutorial so we'll skip the section of it here

31

00:02:26,960  -->  00:02:36,660
and now we'll go to the inputs and the inputs is the main tab of expert properties window what these

32

00:02:36,660  -->  00:02:47,970
inputs mean is sort of controls that you as a trader can change or to adjust the behavior of the forex

33

00:02:47,970  -->  00:02:51,600
robot that you're testing your backtesting.

34

00:02:51,810  -->  00:02:57,030
And these are the same controls that you will see when you launch an expert advisor on your char to

35

00:02:57,030  -->  00:03:02,560
actually trade you will see the same controls and therefore it kind of matches up.

36

00:03:02,560  -->  00:03:07,290
So depending on your back test depending on the settings that you said here and if you're happy with

37

00:03:07,290  -->  00:03:13,290
them then you can set the same settings in your real when you're trading your real account with that

38

00:03:14,410  -->  00:03:15,620
expert adviser.

39

00:03:15,930  -->  00:03:19,980
And why would you want to adjust the behavior of your adviser.

40

00:03:19,980  -->  00:03:28,230
Well because first of all you might want to have different presets for different financial instruments

41

00:03:28,230  -->  00:03:35,910
or periods meaning timeframes and that is essential because different financial instruments behave differently

42

00:03:35,910  -->  00:03:38,910
and therefore expert advisors would trade them differently.

43

00:03:39,060  -->  00:03:45,660
Also with time you might need to change the settings of the expert adviser or you might have different

44

00:03:45,660  -->  00:03:52,080
preferences for example here you can see a lot of parameter and a maximum risk parameter which are responsible

45

00:03:52,080  -->  00:03:54,210
for the amount of money that they expended.

46

00:03:54,210  -->  00:04:03,360
Why is a trade so therefore you could adjust this to cater for your risk versus your specific risk versus

47

00:04:03,360  -->  00:04:07,710
just different people would have different levels of risk tolerance.

48

00:04:07,710  -->  00:04:11,620
I've prepared a short presentation on expert properties that quickly have a look at that.

49

00:04:12,040  -->  00:04:16,890
So you have an expert advisor which you want to conduct the back test for.

50

00:04:16,920  -->  00:04:21,150
Usually the expert advisor comes with a user guide or an instruction manual.

51

00:04:21,180  -->  00:04:26,940
If it's a purchased expert adviser or if it's something that you developed yourself then you will know

52

00:04:26,970  -->  00:04:31,230
already what the expert properties mean.

53

00:04:31,230  -->  00:04:37,890
That is very handy because based on the instruction manual or your intrinsic knowledge of the expert

54

00:04:37,890  -->  00:04:45,030
advisor you can knowingly set these expert properties to certain values and you will either get unprofitable

55

00:04:45,030  -->  00:04:49,830
results like these too or if you set the parameters correctly if you pick the right premises you can

56

00:04:49,830  -->  00:04:51,210
get profitable results.

57

00:04:51,480  -->  00:04:56,550
And that's essentially what we're aiming for in this course we will assume that we have an expert advisor

58

00:04:56,550  -->  00:05:01,110
and we have knowledge of the parameters that we need to set.

59

00:05:01,110  -->  00:05:08,830
And we'll be aiming to optimize or find the right parameters that will give us profitable results that

60

00:05:09,150  -->  00:05:16,050
and therefore that will warrant using these extra devices on our demo accounts or even hypothetically

61

00:05:16,050  -->  00:05:18,330
real accounts for trading.

62

00:05:18,330  -->  00:05:25,680
Of course with these prepackaged expert advisors moving average in the sample it's quite difficult to

63

00:05:25,680  -->  00:05:27,470
get profitable results.

64

00:05:27,540  -->  00:05:34,560
But throughout this course we will be working with a proprietary algorithmic trading system which I

65

00:05:34,560  -->  00:05:41,070
will introduce to in the next section of the course with that system we will look for profit results

66

00:05:41,100  -->  00:05:43,370
and hopefully will find them.

67

00:05:43,380  -->  00:05:49,740
So let's just go ahead and look at this chart this is the chart we got after our back test in the previous

68

00:05:49,790  -->  00:05:52,950
tutorial for the moving average indicator expert wiser.

69

00:05:52,950  -->  00:05:59,040
And now if we change some of the settings here the chart should change so let's go ahead and quickly

70

00:05:59,040  -->  00:06:04,470
have a look at that's if we change the moving period to 24 moving shift to zero.

71

00:06:04,470  -->  00:06:12,240
For example last 2.5 and then launch so expert wise or now you'll notice that the chart looks different

72

00:06:12,250  -->  00:06:12,560
.

73

00:06:13,020  -->  00:06:20,250
And even though it's still not profitable that proves the point that we do have control over how the

74

00:06:20,250  -->  00:06:27,450
trades are conducted and when the extra advisor enters the market and with what volume of currency.

75

00:06:27,450  -->  00:06:32,640
So that's basically the essence of what expert properties are.

76

00:06:32,730  -->  00:06:34,330
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

77

00:06:34,440  -->  00:06:39,140
If you are watching and each of disobey scrubs the channel so you can get updated of new free tutorials

78

00:06:39,150  -->  00:06:40,140
that I post.

79

00:06:40,140  -->  00:06:42,530
I look forward to seeing at the next tutorial.

80

00:06:42,660  -->  00:06:44,370
Until then Happy training
