00:10.420 --> 00:12.640
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:12.640 --> 00:18.240
We're going to talk about a common scenario that can happen to you when you're hiring a freelancer or

00:18.250 --> 00:20.020
hire a contractor.

00:20.020 --> 00:25.270
The scenario is when a freelancer changes or raises their price on you.

00:25.270 --> 00:31.530
Now obviously this is one of the bad bad bad situations that can happen in any type of relationship.

00:31.570 --> 00:37.020
I mean this happened really with any vendor any customer any investor anyone really.

00:37.030 --> 00:41.270
But with freelancers and contractors it is something that can occur.

00:41.650 --> 00:47.520
And if you do this long enough you will run into some Dario's where a freelancer changes their price.

00:47.590 --> 00:52.720
Now primarily when I talk about freelancers raising their price I mean that you work with the freelancer

00:52.730 --> 00:58.600
once they did something for let's say $20 an hour then in the future when you want to contract them

00:58.600 --> 01:00.310
for the same amount of work they say.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.220
Now it's 30 dollars an hour or 40 dollars an hour.

01:03.220 --> 01:08.710
Now if that's the case that is not really that unusual because you have to think of it in terms of their

01:08.710 --> 01:09.710
portfolio.

01:09.970 --> 01:14.650
If you've done work with them then it sounds like they're probably going to take what you did and put

01:14.650 --> 01:17.530
it in their portfolio and also it means that time has elapsed.

01:17.530 --> 01:22.030
So whenever they're bidding on projects now they have a lot more to show for what they've done in the

01:22.030 --> 01:22.860
past.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.120
And now all of a sudden they can ask for a higher price.

01:25.150 --> 01:29.920
A lot of times freelancers will work with you and they know in their head they're working at a discounted

01:29.920 --> 01:37.420
rate and that's solely because they don't have enough of a clientele base or enough of a portfolio.

01:37.420 --> 01:40.920
Now that's the innocuous kind of version of this if that's the case.

01:40.930 --> 01:46.720
Honestly what you can do is you can try to say hey we you know we worked on it before at this price.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.940
I'd be more than happy if we continue at the rate we've established before.

01:52.090 --> 01:58.060
Typically if you can then explain to them why your budget is is the way it is and why that previous

01:58.060 --> 01:59.500
price worked for you.

01:59.500 --> 02:05.860
They're usually in minable the way that you have to offset their increase in perceived value of themselves

02:06.310 --> 02:09.510
is by using some of the perks we talked about before.

02:09.520 --> 02:15.370
You need to find ways of making your proposal non-monetary more attractive.

02:15.370 --> 02:20.310
Now what I mean by that you know if they are wanting $40 an hour and you're trying to get $20 an hour

02:20.390 --> 02:23.030
you need to make everything around that proposal better.

02:23.040 --> 02:28.480
So what you can say as oh well it's a larger block of work right.

02:28.690 --> 02:33.970
Remember freelancers hate having to spend time finding projects but they like working on projects so

02:33.970 --> 02:39.610
if you say to them you know this is a big hundred hour project then they might be willing to forego

02:39.610 --> 02:41.680
the extra money that they raised.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.690
You can also press on the fact that you have a previous working relationship which means that they can

02:46.690 --> 02:52.690
get started much more quickly than before if they're working with a brand new contractor which means

02:52.690 --> 02:58.480
that they can get working a lot faster than if they are working with a brand new employer.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.930
You can always entice them with other work.

03:00.940 --> 03:05.560
The fact that you're coming back to them means that you're serious about using them you can tell them

03:05.560 --> 03:09.430
about how there are other projects you have that you're willing to give them.

03:09.460 --> 03:14.830
Make it kind of like a package deal make it sound like you know I'm going to give you this project and

03:14.830 --> 03:19.630
if you work with me at the same rate I'm going to give you these other projects so for them all of a

03:19.630 --> 03:24.970
sudden it's like they're building a lower rate but it's for a lot more work so you can always match

03:24.970 --> 03:27.970
price but you can always make it up for volume.

03:27.970 --> 03:30.340
There are other smaller ways of offsetting this increase in price.

03:30.340 --> 03:35.230
You can say to them you know you're willing to give them a great review or a testimonial.

03:35.260 --> 03:38.270
You can even say that you can use your project as a case study.

03:38.290 --> 03:43.700
However obviously be aware that this is actually kind of what caused the problem to begin with.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.320
If you keep doing that the price is going to keep rising until it gets to the point where it's just

03:47.320 --> 03:51.670
not rational for them to lower their price all the way back down to what it was originally.

03:51.670 --> 03:55.450
Now this happens all the time work with the freelancer they do very well.

03:55.450 --> 03:57.430
Then later I try to rehire them.

03:57.430 --> 04:01.960
And while a good freelancer is going to do well in general they're going to have they're going to be

04:01.960 --> 04:04.570
popular so their price has risen.

04:04.570 --> 04:09.700
Typically I can negotiate them down to about half the price range but in some scenarios I'm actually

04:09.700 --> 04:14.470
able to get them back near the original rate by offsetting it with other things.

04:14.470 --> 04:17.830
A lot of times they kind of give you a oh I've worked with you before disco.

04:17.860 --> 04:23.080
Now in this scenario that you've started a project and a freelancer raises their price that is less

04:23.080 --> 04:25.990
common but it is still a serious deal.

04:25.990 --> 04:31.960
So you set a milestone system and after milestone to the freelancer Assizes do raise their price.

04:31.960 --> 04:37.360
Now what is typically going on here now the freelancers probably discovered in the middle of the work

04:37.360 --> 04:40.650
that it's a lot more complicated than they previously thought.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.010
Now that could be due to two things.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.120
One you didn't give them enough information up front.

04:44.110 --> 04:48.700
Or two they simply didn't do the diligence and the research to figure out how expensive it should have

04:48.700 --> 04:49.440
been.

04:49.450 --> 04:55.780
This is something that happens frequently with bidders who are bidding and they bid across lots and

04:55.780 --> 04:56.700
lots of projects.

04:56.830 --> 05:02.770
They simply don't have the attention span and the time spent on your project to actually be able to

05:02.770 --> 05:08.050
forecast how much effort it's going to take reliably and so a lot of times those people drop out.

05:08.050 --> 05:11.830
That's why we covered previously in the looking for things like message fatigue.

05:11.870 --> 05:15.890
So if it is the case that you're in the middle of a project and a freelancer decides that it's a lot

05:15.890 --> 05:19.210
more complicated or they need to be paid more money.

05:19.460 --> 05:24.080
Really what you do is you need to set down and actually think about what's going on you need to assess

05:24.080 --> 05:28.910
whether or not you put your full effort forward in describing what the project was.

05:29.090 --> 05:34.130
And if you follow all the tips and techniques in this course this will never happen to you because there

05:34.130 --> 05:39.860
are so many different safeguards before you even start a project to weed out people who are more likely

05:39.860 --> 05:45.560
to do this but also to look for weaknesses in your spec sheet and your overviews so that there really

05:45.560 --> 05:50.360
are no minds when you actually get into the actual project development.

05:50.420 --> 05:57.080
If it is the case that you did actually misrepresent your project you need to understand that freelancers

05:57.080 --> 05:57.860
are not psychic.

05:57.860 --> 06:01.930
They can't possibly understand every single thing the project's going to need.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.750
And they also are kind of basing their bid or their estimate off of a general range they think it's

06:08.750 --> 06:11.660
going to cost it's never exact.

06:11.660 --> 06:16.760
Now obviously if you did time and materials or you did that hybrid rate that we previously talked about

06:17.060 --> 06:18.070
then you don't have this problem.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.720
This is really only a problem when you're doing a project costs.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.640
This is one of the reasons why we always say don't do a project cost.

06:23.720 --> 06:28.550
But if it is the case you misrepresented yourself then you do need to be aware of the fact that you

06:28.550 --> 06:31.920
probably should be paying more and you need to reassess it.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.940
Make sure to get outside bids so that you can use that as leverage to explain to them this is a realistic

06:37.940 --> 06:42.800
bid if it's the case that no actually they just misunderstood it.

06:43.070 --> 06:48.500
Well typically what will happen in this case is you're going to have to explain to them the importance

06:48.500 --> 06:54.110
of finishing the project and explain to them after that point you know we'll make sure that all future

06:54.110 --> 07:01.070
projects are you know green light on both sides that the price is accurate and that we do double checking

07:01.670 --> 07:03.500
to make sure that the price is OK.

07:03.620 --> 07:08.240
In most cases the freelancer is fine with continuing because they don't want to waste their time as

07:08.240 --> 07:08.870
well.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.350
They want something to show for their work.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.430
And most times just trying to talk them through it.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.480
To explain that you gave them all the information up front.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.810
That's usually enough for them to say OK I'm going to finish it.

07:21.830 --> 07:22.980
But then I'm done.

07:23.090 --> 07:26.990
If you tell them you know oh I see I understand this is a mistake but we gave you all the information

07:26.990 --> 07:28.410
you need in the future.

07:28.430 --> 07:33.410
It will be fixed and you tell them again leverage the fact that they can have future projects that is

07:33.410 --> 07:35.290
usually enough to get them over the hump.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.870
Past that you can obviously use other perks to get them to finish.

07:38.870 --> 07:44.330
You can also use the stick as opposed to the carrot and make sure they understand that a negative review

07:44.330 --> 07:46.430
is very powerful on their profile.

07:46.430 --> 07:53.630
Again we tried to look for freelancers that have past histories working on the platform because then

07:53.630 --> 07:57.200
they have something that you can kind of hold against them in case something goes wrong.

07:57.320 --> 07:57.620
OK.

07:57.620 --> 08:03.020
So those are the two main scenarios where you might have a price problem or a freelancer changes their

08:03.020 --> 08:03.840
price.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.690
One's pretty innocuous ones a lot harder and a lot trickier.

08:07.700 --> 08:12.800
But if you follow the kind of prescriptions I've given you in this lecture you should be able to get

08:12.800 --> 08:17.950
through the majority of problems you guys have any questions or any experiences you'd like to share.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.550
Posts in the group discussion I'd love to help you through it.

08:20.630 --> 08:25.280
Help you weed through any kind of sticky weird situations you have.

08:25.280 --> 08:35.080
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
