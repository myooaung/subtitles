00:05.700 --> 00:09.430
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to go over a sauna.

00:09.430 --> 00:16.710
A sauna is a free and very very very popular project management tool that a lot of startups use.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.660
I believe it was started by the co-founder of Facebook.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.690
It's very light.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.960
It's very easy it works on every single device you have.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.950
Now we're going to cover how to get acquainted with it which features and kind of aspects of it.

00:30.950 --> 00:33.170
Should you be familiarized with.

00:33.350 --> 00:39.970
And then in the next lecture are going to go over how you can use this for your actual situation and

00:39.990 --> 00:43.650
for your actual contractor kind of scenario.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.890
Now asana is great for a lot of different things.

00:45.890 --> 00:49.970
It's Personally my favorite project management tool and it's what we use here at Sprint.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.170
OK so without further ado let's get into a sauna.

00:53.220 --> 00:58.170
Start messing around start getting used to it and then we'll start talking about how you can make this

00:58.170 --> 01:03.600
work for you and your project and how you can make it dramatically increase the efficiency of your project.

01:03.610 --> 01:05.460
So let's go to the screencast.

01:05.460 --> 01:05.790
All right.

01:05.790 --> 01:09.690
So let's get acquainted with a sauna now.

01:09.690 --> 01:16.560
So the way that a sauna works is it kind of looks like any type of web Administration panel that you've

01:16.560 --> 01:18.110
ever kind of logged into.

01:18.180 --> 01:20.630
Looks kind of like Wordpress when you log into it.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.290
It's essentially a system of task list.

01:24.570 --> 01:29.580
You can see right here this is literally the first page you'll see once you create an account it all

01:29.580 --> 01:33.140
uses lists to put everything together.

01:33.270 --> 01:38.100
That's a little bit different than base camp and it's a little bit different than the other popular

01:38.100 --> 01:43.950
project management tools and it's one of the reasons why we like a sauna so much because it allows you

01:43.950 --> 01:48.500
to list anything you're doing quite literally anything in a linear fashion.

01:49.110 --> 01:54.150
And make sure that you can itemize out every single thing and then move through them.

01:54.360 --> 01:59.360
So if you're not familiar with asana literally you just go to a sauna dot com.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.340
Go and create an account.

02:01.350 --> 02:06.400
It's quite literally only two screens and this is the first screen you will see.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.400
Ours is a little bit different because it has some projects in it and it has some data that I've already

02:11.460 --> 02:17.850
inserted before we have multiple counts but you also look essentially like this.

02:18.570 --> 02:25.530
So the way that this works is right here on the left hand side we have all the different sections of

02:25.530 --> 02:25.900
the song.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.800
So my tasks are all the tasks that are assigned to you.

02:29.850 --> 02:37.020
Things that you are involved in your Diasporan is the area where you can get project based summaries

02:37.920 --> 02:43.560
and then these other sections right here just show all of the items that exist within their project

02:43.560 --> 02:45.090
management tool.

02:45.090 --> 02:50.400
Now the simplest way of using a sauna is to simply just create a project in the core you create a project

02:50.400 --> 02:57.370
is down here so you go down to project X on it plus and we can call this whatever we want.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.450
Then you can choose privacy.

03:01.620 --> 03:06.330
So the way that this works is I can say it's open to sprint kicks so I said this anyone in our company

03:06.330 --> 03:11.550
could see this or this would go to the master kind of a sauna and if I said this to private that wouldn't

03:11.550 --> 03:17.670
mean that I have to invite every single person to the project to see it so I could have people who are

03:17.760 --> 03:23.820
in this Assata looking at some of the other projects but not able to view this project so you would

03:23.820 --> 03:27.520
pick private if you use the sauna for multiple projects.

03:27.570 --> 03:33.570
Say you had some project that was completely unrelated to the other one and you're keeping track of

03:33.570 --> 03:35.300
it in Asuna.

03:35.580 --> 03:39.690
A lot of times also people use this as a personal productivity tool.

03:39.690 --> 03:44.700
They list out all the tasks they need to get done today or this week or this month and they use that.

03:44.700 --> 03:49.290
And so you obviously wouldn't want to share that with a contractor or someone you're outsourcing with.

03:49.290 --> 03:52.170
So if that was the case you're going to pick private.

03:52.170 --> 03:56.390
Now if you have multiple projects where the people that you're working with they're going to bring into

03:56.400 --> 04:02.640
this work across different projects which happens quite frequently especially when you find someone

04:02.940 --> 04:08.040
that you really enjoy working with and they have multiple skill sets which most developers or designers

04:08.040 --> 04:14.190
do in that case you can actually add them to multiple projects and if you set this to open they can

04:14.190 --> 04:18.980
actually jump across and see what's available in the other ones just for the purposes of this.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.080
I'm going to show you what it looks like when you couldn't open project.

04:22.080 --> 04:29.100
And here we can put a description descriptions are helpful for you to remember what exactly this project

04:29.100 --> 04:33.870
is about or to get a snapshot because a lot of times you'll have lots and lots of projects so it's very

04:33.870 --> 04:34.780
helpful.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.230
Keep it simple.

04:40.320 --> 04:46.730
All right so right here off about this is our project and it looks kind of like a legal pad almost as

04:46.730 --> 04:52.610
you can see it's quite literally just a vertical view of what is essentially a task list.

04:52.610 --> 04:56.750
Now the core of Ossana is you can literally just add a task.

04:56.750 --> 05:03.910
So I wanted to add a task I would just click and I would add a task I could say you know create for

05:03.980 --> 05:12.220
it you know application you know depending on what you're using you could do this in any way you want.

05:12.260 --> 05:16.580
That's how you got a task if you want to add another task you simply just hit enter and you can move

05:16.580 --> 05:18.200
all the way down.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.340
Now within each individual task there's a lot of different things you can do.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.120
So right here you have the check box and that just means you market complete.

05:26.120 --> 05:30.590
Now if I click this it's going to say that it's complete it's going to disappear.

05:30.590 --> 05:35.440
You can see the completed task by going to view tasks to do.

05:35.510 --> 05:39.500
And then you can go to a recently completed tasks and I'll show up on today.

05:39.530 --> 05:42.480
Now it can also you can also select yesterday.

05:42.530 --> 05:47.930
You can also select one two and three weeks it'll show up in these three and this one put out yesterday.

05:47.930 --> 05:52.910
Now the reason why this is helpful is because as you are running a project and you have multiple people

05:52.910 --> 05:58.700
contributing to the project multiple people adding tasks removing task etc. it's really helpful to see

05:58.970 --> 06:03.600
you know when you log in first thing in the day what happened yesterday what got finished.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.030
What do I need to check.

06:05.300 --> 06:11.510
So what you typically will do is when you create a project you go off and list all of the main overview

06:11.510 --> 06:13.590
points of what you need to get done.

06:13.610 --> 06:19.920
This would be a theoretical project so we could say you know build first screen because they build a

06:19.920 --> 06:23.510
screen and you know you could say second screen

06:28.830 --> 06:33.630
so literally you can put whatever you think you need in your project.

06:33.630 --> 06:34.890
This can be a design project.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.600
It could be really anything.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.270
I mean you're going to use this for brainstorming.

06:39.270 --> 06:44.870
You can put ideas down now after you've created a task there's again several things you can do.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.990
You can check it as done.

06:47.010 --> 06:50.070
You can also assign this task to someone.

06:50.070 --> 06:55.410
Now the way that you do this is you simply just click it and you can put in the email or the name of

06:55.410 --> 06:57.610
the person you're signing it to.

06:57.630 --> 07:03.540
Now when you do that any person who has been assigned to Task has that show up in there my task section

07:03.870 --> 07:06.330
it also automatically keeps them in.

07:06.330 --> 07:11.730
To get push notifications if they have this on app it also gives them email notifications and gives

07:11.730 --> 07:17.910
them tax notifications as do dates are coming or as they're assigned a task or as a task they're assigned

07:17.910 --> 07:18.540
is finished.

07:18.540 --> 07:24.120
So it's going to keep all of the relevant parties in each task notified.

07:24.120 --> 07:29.790
Now the easiest way to add someone to your screen or the easiest way to add one to a project is quite

07:29.790 --> 07:34.620
simply to go over here and say invite people here you just put in the email address of whoever you are

07:34.620 --> 07:43.110
in a work with say its freelancer freelance dot com and I would invite and that would send them an invitation

07:43.110 --> 07:49.000
for them to sign up and get into this project page or they can now see everything.

07:49.020 --> 07:52.050
So it's very very easy to on board someone.

07:52.050 --> 07:59.700
And that's why I also suggest using Assata to manage your projects because it's very easy to get a contractor

08:00.000 --> 08:02.840
or an outsourced freelancer into this.

08:02.880 --> 08:10.200
Now convincing someone to use a project management tool might have some resistance up front you might

08:10.200 --> 08:14.770
have some developers or designers be resistant to the idea.

08:15.150 --> 08:21.750
And the reason why they might be resistant to using a project management tool like this is because for

08:21.750 --> 08:26.830
one a lot of them have their own processes by which they create their own projects.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.740
Now the reason is a lot of them don't want to feel like they're being monitored and feel like they have

08:31.740 --> 08:38.180
to and feel as if the person they're working with can see their progress on a day to day basis.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.250
And here's the thing.

08:39.270 --> 08:44.220
You know there is some truth to that as a freelancer freelancers you get very comfortable in the way

08:44.220 --> 08:45.300
that they work.

08:45.300 --> 08:51.120
I personally always like using this with all of our contractors or outsource teams.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.800
And the reason why is because it's a great way of testing to see whether or not they're good freelancer

08:55.800 --> 09:02.770
or contractor if they really don't want to use an online project management tool that it's a chance

09:02.770 --> 09:06.030
that this is probably not a good person to work with.

09:06.180 --> 09:10.260
You really want to work with people who are adaptable and people who are open to change.

09:10.260 --> 09:15.630
You want to work with people who value things like transparency and value things like being able to

09:15.630 --> 09:17.470
communicate effectively.

09:17.480 --> 09:24.960
Now if they insist on using say like an E L'anse page or using e-mail to monitor your project progress

09:25.260 --> 09:32.610
they're basically saying I prefer to keep you in the dark and they think that the hassle of updating

09:32.610 --> 09:33.880
you more often.

09:33.970 --> 09:41.280
And it's very easy to use an intuitive way is more valuable than actually being able to tell what's

09:41.280 --> 09:46.630
going on in the project and for you to know whether or not your money is being spent correctly.

09:46.650 --> 09:51.570
So I like it because you can quite literally just add an email and invite them all that means is that

09:51.570 --> 09:57.510
you need to have their email address so if you've hired someone off up work you hired someone off of

09:57.540 --> 09:58.770
really anywhere.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.140
All you need is their email and you can add them and they're in.

10:01.140 --> 10:06.780
And now all of a sudden we can start adding tasks assigning it to that person and then we can start

10:06.780 --> 10:07.530
working.

10:07.710 --> 10:12.840
And see now that I've added someone right here it's going to wait til they confirm and once they confirm

10:12.960 --> 10:16.160
and sign up then all of a sudden they'll have more functionality.

10:16.170 --> 10:22.350
Usually the color of their icon changes but I can still assign them tasks so I could say this one is

10:22.350 --> 10:28.060
now assigned to you and you can see now that this freelancer freelancer is assigned to this task.

10:28.410 --> 10:33.600
OK so now on the right side of the pain this is where we get the drill down on each individual task

10:34.140 --> 10:40.740
on the individual task what we can do is we can change the project it's and we can add a description

10:40.740 --> 10:41.730
of each individual task.

10:41.730 --> 10:45.770
This is where you know we can take a high level description and then get into the details.

10:45.900 --> 10:51.480
But most importantly now you have a thread where you can have a thread and describe what's happening

10:51.750 --> 10:52.500
with this task.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.740
What exactly do you mean.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.230
Do your requirements change.

10:55.230 --> 11:00.620
Do you have more information at the other person can also respond with where they are in the process.

11:00.720 --> 11:06.390
They correspond with questions directly to this task and you can answer this an efficient way and as

11:06.390 --> 11:10.830
long as you're added to this task you will get notified every time that happens.

11:10.830 --> 11:17.400
Now imagine doing that e-mail if you told them I would install this widget in my Wordpress and you didn't

11:17.400 --> 11:19.950
give them all of the information they would need.

11:19.950 --> 11:25.140
Or maybe they go in there and something's different something in the Wordpress code is change the widget

11:25.170 --> 11:26.730
has changed its documentation.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.290
The anality is different.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.930
And also there are other things that are happening in the project.

11:31.940 --> 11:39.330
They just send you one big bulk e-mail to this one big project update and Elance or up work or freelancer.

11:39.330 --> 11:40.790
That's just very inefficient.

11:40.810 --> 11:44.690
It's very inefficient in terms of organization in terms of speed.

11:44.690 --> 11:49.670
In this case as they're quite literally responding to something I can get the information from them

11:49.730 --> 11:52.850
and I can respond specifically to that task.

11:52.850 --> 11:57.360
That is one of the bigger problems with project management especially around web and mobile projects.

11:57.380 --> 12:01.550
You don't always know exactly what a developer or designer is talking about.

12:01.550 --> 12:05.090
And this allows you to literally drill down on whatever it is.

12:05.090 --> 12:10.640
And typically when you build tasks they're going to be much much more specific than this but I'm going

12:10.640 --> 12:21.160
to show you how you can make this a little bit more sensical in just a second.
