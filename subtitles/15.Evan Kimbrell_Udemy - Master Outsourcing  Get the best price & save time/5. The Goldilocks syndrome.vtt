00:09.270 --> 00:14.790
Hey Guys welcome to the course so in this lecture I'm going to introduce a concept we call the Goldilocks

00:14.790 --> 00:15.510
syndrome.

00:15.550 --> 00:21.600
Now what exactly that means is it has to do with when you have a project and you go out there and you

00:21.600 --> 00:27.030
start asking freelancers or freelance firms for bids and you start kind of bringing them in.

00:27.030 --> 00:33.120
You start looking at a board of all your different project bids a lot of people have what we call the

00:33.120 --> 00:40.620
Goldilocks syndrome where they don't pick based off of essentially valid reasons for working with the

00:40.620 --> 00:41.190
freelancer.

00:41.190 --> 00:42.580
They just look at price.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.590
And so what they'll do is to look at the cheapest option the most expensive option and then just make

00:46.620 --> 00:51.930
a quick rational decision that if the price is somewhere in the middle they're going to go with that.

00:51.930 --> 00:54.200
So obviously this is something that you want to avoid.

00:54.270 --> 00:54.810
Right.

00:55.050 --> 01:00.210
But more importantly you need to understand why exactly that's a bad idea.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.160
It might seem reasonable to someone who's brand new to this that when they see a bunch of bids you know

01:05.220 --> 01:09.990
someone might be charging too much and someone might be charging too little and that's it's actually

01:09.990 --> 01:16.530
rational to assume that the cheapest bid is probably someone who is artificially subsidizing their price.

01:16.530 --> 01:17.040
Right.

01:17.070 --> 01:20.940
They're probably someone who's brand new to this so they know they have to put the project price really

01:20.940 --> 01:21.590
low.

01:21.750 --> 01:26.310
That's always a bad idea because you know what happens if that person doesn't like the price once they're

01:26.310 --> 01:30.930
halfway through the project they're much much more likely to quit on you and you have no idea what their

01:30.930 --> 01:31.940
track record is like.

01:32.070 --> 01:36.630
And the flipside though when you have an extra high price you might just assume that they're either

01:36.630 --> 01:42.480
overcharging you or they probably misunderstood the project requirements or there's a lot more going

01:42.480 --> 01:44.530
into that bid than you ever would need.

01:44.580 --> 01:48.310
So a lot of people would then assume OK it has to be somewhere in the middle.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.590
I mean to give you a couple of ways to look at the price a little bit more dynamically and make a better

01:52.590 --> 01:53.200
decision.

01:53.250 --> 01:58.900
Okay so never judge the price based off its relationship to the other bids.

01:58.980 --> 02:03.270
If you took advantage of what's called private bidding and in any of these platforms that we covered

02:03.570 --> 02:08.670
you probably get to skip over this problem because a lot of times if someone bids 100 and someone bids

02:08.670 --> 02:13.530
200 someone will probably bid like 110 or they might bid 80.

02:13.530 --> 02:18.000
It's kind of like The Price is Right where someone always has to bid somewhere where they think it's

02:18.000 --> 02:19.050
going to look the best.

02:19.050 --> 02:23.250
Now it's unavoidable that people do this and typically if they're bidding their and they're putting

02:23.250 --> 02:27.730
their price relative someone else's price then they're not being honest.

02:27.810 --> 02:31.410
They should be charging you exactly what they think it's going to take and they should be using their

02:31.410 --> 02:34.550
own measurements and their own techniques for determining that amount.

02:34.680 --> 02:39.750
But the best way of avoiding the Goldilocks syndrome is actually just to think about your organization

02:39.780 --> 02:41.480
and your project as a whole.

02:41.490 --> 02:45.660
We talked about this a little bit in the last lecture but what's really important for you to understand

02:45.660 --> 02:54.620
is one take a quick think about how much expertise you have with outsourcing or contracting in general.

02:54.690 --> 02:59.040
Have you worked one on one with a freelancer or a contractor before.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.590
Have you been a freelancer or contractor.

03:01.590 --> 03:05.070
How many contractors do you work with regularly.

03:05.070 --> 03:09.510
If you've worked with a lot of them then it's worth saying that you probably have a little bit of expertise

03:09.510 --> 03:10.230
with this.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.990
Now what that means to me and what that means to you is that if you have a lot of expertise that probably

03:15.990 --> 03:21.840
means you're going to be more capable of handling a contractor and you're going to be capable of handling

03:21.840 --> 03:26.090
a contractor who doesn't have as much experience as say one of the more polished ones.

03:26.100 --> 03:31.260
Now a lot of what you're paying for when you hire a freelancer or a contractor is you're paying for

03:31.260 --> 03:34.320
their autonomy and their ability to think on their feet.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.670
The more upright the more you pay and the higher the price goes the more likely that person is going

03:38.670 --> 03:44.670
to be able to make judgments and on the spot decisions that can benefit your project and you're basically

03:44.670 --> 03:47.310
saying I trust this person to have more autonomy.

03:47.520 --> 03:53.910
Now if you have more expertise yourself then you can actually lower the price so your target price should

03:53.910 --> 03:54.500
be lower.

03:54.510 --> 03:59.970
Because a lot of that burden of making decisions on the fly can be shifted on to you and that's where

03:59.970 --> 04:01.680
you get the biggest project savings.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.910
Now second thing to look at how much time are you going to spend on this project how much time are you

04:05.910 --> 04:08.000
comfortable spending on this project.

04:08.130 --> 04:14.280
If you want to spend a lot of time on the project then lower the price it put your target lower towards

04:14.280 --> 04:16.040
lower towards the end of the range.

04:16.050 --> 04:19.140
Now if you don't want to spend a lot of time this is something you're outsourcing on the side and you

04:19.140 --> 04:23.910
are completely busy doing other things then you need to raise your target.

04:23.910 --> 04:29.100
Another thing to take into consideration look at the specifications that you wrote later in this course

04:29.100 --> 04:33.720
we're actually going to cover how you can do in-depth specifications and how you can do wire frames

04:33.990 --> 04:39.020
but also take into consideration how familiar are you with the project that you're building.

04:39.030 --> 04:42.400
Is this in a technology you have absolutely no familiarity with.

04:42.420 --> 04:48.480
Is this in a section of your company or your business that you don't really deal with very often if

04:48.480 --> 04:53.310
you don't have a lot of familiarity with what you're outsourcing or you're contracting then you should

04:53.310 --> 04:55.230
probably think about paying more.

04:55.230 --> 05:00.450
So your ideal price should be a little bit higher in the relative range but if you're one of those people

05:00.450 --> 05:04.890
that just has an awesome spec sheet you spend a lot of time on it researching it.

05:05.010 --> 05:10.370
You know the problems that are going to arise you know what what's most important to the project and

05:10.370 --> 05:15.350
what's not as important to the project and you can prioritize like that then you have an opportunity

05:15.350 --> 05:16.760
for a lot more cost savings.

05:16.780 --> 05:21.850
And the last thing that you should take into consideration is the freelancer or the firm itself.

05:21.950 --> 05:29.000
Look at what they say to you if they have a very specific connection to what they're proposing and they're

05:29.000 --> 05:35.500
articulate and they clearly have thought about your project then you need to give that person more value.

05:35.510 --> 05:41.540
So if that person had a higher bid you should just kind of ignore their price and assume that they're

05:41.540 --> 05:43.730
actually kind of in a sense cheaper.

05:43.750 --> 05:43.960
Right.

05:43.970 --> 05:49.020
Because the more they understand your project the higher likelihood that your projects going to be successful.

05:49.110 --> 05:53.960
Really look at the portfolios of the people bidding if you have some of the fantastic portfolio that's

05:53.960 --> 05:58.110
very articulate you should obviously value that person more.

05:58.130 --> 06:02.150
So key takeaways from this lecture avoid the Goldilocks syndrome.

06:02.180 --> 06:07.490
Don't just pick your price relative to the other prices you've gotten because that is not the truest

06:07.490 --> 06:08.260
way of doing this.

06:08.270 --> 06:11.480
Take into consideration you yourself your expertise.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.540
How detailed are your spec sheets.

06:13.550 --> 06:15.080
Did you do wireframe.

06:15.110 --> 06:20.990
How familiar are you with the project and the technology itself and incorporate that into what your

06:20.990 --> 06:22.660
ideal price should be.

06:22.910 --> 06:29.960
More experience better specs more familiarity with the project you should have a lower ideal price and

06:29.960 --> 06:31.650
you can save yourself a lot of money.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.490
But on the flip side if you're unfamiliar you're inexperience and you're way too busy.

06:35.570 --> 06:38.290
You need to raise your price now.

06:38.390 --> 06:41.270
Again don't make your judgments solely based off the price.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.040
Look at the individual freelancer.

06:43.040 --> 06:48.460
If they have specific portfolio items that relate to your project you should value that person more.

06:48.530 --> 06:53.000
And if they've actually taken time to think about your project it's not a cookie cutter message that

06:53.000 --> 06:58.370
they sent to you and you can tell that they're dynamic and they can think on their feet and it might

06:58.370 --> 07:03.380
be the case that their price doesn't actually reflect how thoughtful they are they might be a cheaper

07:03.380 --> 07:03.780
option.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.160
You can tell they actually have thought about your project and are interested in it you should give

07:07.160 --> 07:08.470
those people a bump.

07:08.490 --> 07:13.240
OK so I don't really want to overwhelm you with different criteria you can use to pick your freelance

07:13.240 --> 07:18.920
or run a cover or a ton of other ways and other factors you should put into your judgment when you're

07:18.920 --> 07:20.350
actually picking someone.

07:20.450 --> 07:21.820
But this is a pretty good guide.

07:21.830 --> 07:25.010
Don't just go off of the price relative to others.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.350
That is not the best way of getting the best price.

07:27.350 --> 07:27.530
All right.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.330
So in the next lecture.
