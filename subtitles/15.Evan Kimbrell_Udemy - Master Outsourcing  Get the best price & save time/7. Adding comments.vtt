OK and the last section comments this is the section where you quite literally will put any odds and

00:11.070 --> 00:17.250
ends you can think of that are important you know my favorite things to put in this.

00:17.520 --> 00:22.830
I always like to mention in the comments how exactly the project is going to work when I'm going to

00:22.830 --> 00:28.170
start you know how fast you view any deadlines.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.300
I'd like to discuss like let them know for instance what's the status of the design if you're writing

00:33.300 --> 00:39.370
this for a designer then you need to let the designer know what the status of the development is.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.030
You need to let them know for instance if they're supposed to work on one section first and then another

00:45.030 --> 00:45.870
section.

00:45.870 --> 00:51.000
These are all areas where I would put into comments and comments you can talk about things like you

00:51.000 --> 00:53.580
know this section I'm not 100 percent sure on.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.960
I might change it.

00:54.990 --> 01:00.360
That's something that's worth saying because I'm the person who is looking at this needs to know to

01:00.390 --> 01:07.320
either change their estimation or program it or make it in a way such that they can change on the fly.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.960
Really anything you think of that can be helpful.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.180
Often times you can put requests in the comment.

01:13.200 --> 01:19.290
You can ask about a certain technology or technique or a suggestion for how to handle something really

01:19.290 --> 01:20.730
this is odds and ends.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.990
The entire point of this is that you want to put everything in here that you couldn't think of to fit

01:24.990 --> 01:31.890
elsewhere so that later on when and if you have a problem hopefully you don't always come back and say

01:31.890 --> 01:34.500
hey at least you were aware of it beforehand.

01:34.530 --> 01:38.050
That's typically what I like to use the comment section for.

01:38.070 --> 01:43.860
So try to cover all the details you can anything you couldn't fit in before that you think is relevant

01:43.860 --> 01:51.060
to the project to your relationship with the contractor and to the success of the project put in the

01:51.060 --> 01:51.540
comments.

01:51.540 --> 01:57.660
Now keep in mind this is not legally binding information but when the sense that you want them to have

01:57.660 --> 02:02.550
as much information as possible up front that's why you should spend some time putting anything into

02:02.550 --> 02:05.460
your comments it's always helpful also as you're going through this.

02:05.460 --> 02:10.650
You can always just think kind of you know on the side or even take notes on the side saying this is

02:10.650 --> 02:16.050
something I have a thought about or a question about and then I'm going to attach that at the end in

02:16.050 --> 02:23.280
the comments section because in the next lecture we're going to cover wire framing which is just as

02:23.280 --> 02:29.490
crucial as the spec sheet if not more I think we're getting to a point now where wireframe they are

02:29.490 --> 02:31.760
more important than the spec sheet specs.

02:31.780 --> 02:36.600
It's a little bit old school but if you want to be as accurate and as successful as possible you want

02:36.600 --> 02:45.860
to do both of them so see in the next lecture.
