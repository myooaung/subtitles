It thought I'd talk really quickly about something that a lot of you guys have been mentioning which

00:10.670 --> 00:12.420
is what do I do.

00:12.470 --> 00:17.600
At this stage in the process if there is something in my application I forgot to tell the freelancer

00:17.600 --> 00:18.790
to do.

00:19.340 --> 00:20.540
First off don't fret about it.

00:20.540 --> 00:21.320
It's not a big deal.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.260
A lot of developers expect this to happen if there are good developer.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.470
They should know that going to forget things.

00:27.470 --> 00:33.710
I do it all the time still to this day and I have a professional process by which I and other people

00:33.710 --> 00:40.340
go through and develop the specifications what you should do if that is the case to rectify this issue.

00:40.380 --> 00:46.870
One look at the contract in the agreement that you had with them if you're on a per hour basis it's

00:46.870 --> 00:50.160
really simple you say hey I screwed up this is something I'd like to add.

00:50.170 --> 00:52.770
And they're just going to charge you for the amount of time that it takes.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.760
So that works perfectly if it's a fixed price.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.380
What you need to do is look back at your specifications in your contract and see whether or not it actually

00:59.380 --> 01:00.520
does include it.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.740
And then if it doesn't explicitly include it look to see if it implies that there are a lot of times

01:05.740 --> 01:10.210
that you'll forget to say they'll do this simply because you didn't think that they wouldn't need that

01:10.210 --> 01:11.320
instruction.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.850
For instance you might think that you don't need to explicitly tell them that you need intermediary

01:15.850 --> 01:20.590
screens like you don't need a screen that pops up and says error or when something goes wrong they might

01:20.590 --> 01:25.310
just have standard text at the top or they might not display anything because they're following the

01:25.330 --> 01:26.890
instructions to the T.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.230
If that's the case look to see if it's implied.

01:29.230 --> 01:35.290
Most developers if you tell them that this was implied or they should have known that the product wouldn't

01:35.290 --> 01:37.920
be good if they didn't do this we'll do that.

01:38.170 --> 01:44.350
And if they don't then unfortunately you just need to negotiate out a additional payment try to keep

01:44.350 --> 01:49.790
it low try to obviously say that like you know it's both your fault that's not a big deal that's the

01:49.790 --> 01:52.630
worst case scenario would you still just have to pay a little bit extra money.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.340
But if your contract did cover it your specifications incurred then great if it didn't allow you to

01:57.380 --> 01:58.280
pay a little bit extra.
