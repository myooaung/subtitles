00:10.640 --> 00:15.780
You guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture I want to go over a really quick quick and dirty

00:15.780 --> 00:23.160
kind of strategy that you can use to get better results from your freelancer and for your job postings.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.890
So there's this one here at Sprint.

00:24.930 --> 00:30.300
We've actually tested with quite extensively and it's something that we've done a lot of people who

00:30.330 --> 00:35.580
outsource frequently do not take advantage of and so it's something that we think it's really crucial

00:35.580 --> 00:39.910
that if you're taking this course it's something that you try out at least a couple times.

00:39.930 --> 00:46.440
So the strategy in this one is literally just whenever you are making a job posting always say it's

00:46.440 --> 00:48.190
long term.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.670
OK now let me explain why you do that and what I mean by that.

00:51.690 --> 00:56.430
Typically when you're listing out your listing and you'll see later in the course and we go over things

00:56.430 --> 01:03.580
like perks perks or things that you list in your job posting that supposed to entice the freelancer

01:03.600 --> 01:06.720
to take your job posting more seriously and to be more interested.

01:06.970 --> 01:11.070
But when you go through that and you start thinking of perks one of the things you can always list is

01:11.100 --> 01:13.570
you can say that it's long term.

01:13.570 --> 01:19.950
Now the reason why we say this is a strategy is because it has a lot of beneficial effects but it's

01:19.950 --> 01:25.980
also something that even if you're not looking to hire someone long term it's still a valid thing that

01:25.980 --> 01:27.480
you can list and say.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.910
Now first off if you say it's a long term project a freelancer or a freelance firm they're just going

01:32.910 --> 01:34.400
to take it more seriously.

01:34.530 --> 01:35.360
That's important.

01:35.370 --> 01:38.610
You want your freelancers to take this seriously.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.500
If they don't they're going to give you templates.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.850
They're not going to pay attention to what you're asking and you're just going to get an overall lower

01:44.850 --> 01:46.500
quality experience.

01:46.580 --> 01:53.610
Now not only do they pay more attention to it you'll actually get more accurate prices and this is something

01:53.610 --> 01:58.410
we've played around with and we even caught freelancers giving us two prices for virtually the same

01:58.410 --> 01:59.390
thing.

01:59.430 --> 02:02.070
One was lower when they thought it was long term.

02:02.070 --> 02:08.130
Now to understand why this happens you need to understand why a freelancer likes a long term projects

02:08.160 --> 02:12.380
and why they do not like one off projects it seems rather obvious.

02:12.390 --> 02:15.430
But I think it's kind of important to understand what's going on here.

02:15.450 --> 02:18.150
It's not just that long term means more money.

02:18.150 --> 02:22.890
What it means is that they don't have to spend as much time looking for projects.

02:22.890 --> 02:28.680
Now imagine you're a developer and you spend four hours a day programming and getting paid for it and

02:28.680 --> 02:31.270
you spend two hours trying to find another project.

02:31.380 --> 02:35.250
So you just spent six hours working and you're only going to get paid for four hours.

02:35.250 --> 02:39.300
That is something that freelancers and freelance firms hate having to deal with.

02:39.390 --> 02:44.490
It's bigger for freelancers because they just don't want to spend time looking for projects and they

02:44.490 --> 02:48.540
don't want to have to develop that as a separate skill set to what they're good at.

02:48.570 --> 02:50.010
They want to focus on their craft.

02:50.040 --> 02:55.710
Every time every hour they spend doing something else like acquiring clients is generally thought of

02:55.710 --> 02:56.680
as wasted time.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.550
It's not time for them to grow.

02:58.590 --> 03:03.020
It's not time for them to get better what they're doing it's just not a good situation.

03:03.030 --> 03:09.810
So if they can attach to you get a long term project or get follow on projects that changes the mental

03:09.810 --> 03:11.040
calculus for them.

03:11.250 --> 03:17.220
If you knew a project was a one off project you would probably bid higher because you have to factor

03:17.220 --> 03:23.550
in the time it took to not only find the project bid on the project when the project but also established

03:23.560 --> 03:28.190
the basic rapport get set up and get working with your employer.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.560
So there's always an advantage to saying it's long term.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.170
Now how do I explain that.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.090
Every project is long term.

03:35.310 --> 03:39.840
Well it's not necessarily that the project itself is long term it's that you're looking for a long term

03:39.840 --> 03:40.890
relationship.

03:40.980 --> 03:45.330
Whenever you've worked with someone you're going to be significantly more likely to work with them in

03:45.330 --> 03:48.530
the future especially if you have a good experience with them.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.880
Even if you had an okay experience you've already worked with them you know how fast they respond.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.130
You know how fast they get work done and you know exactly what they're good at and what they're not

03:56.160 --> 03:56.730
good at.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.790
That is almost always better than going into the pile and looking for another person you've never met.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.440
You have no familiarity with.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.630
So when I say long term project what I really mean is it's a long term relationship.

04:08.700 --> 04:14.040
Even if this project does not extend you're always going to be one of the first people I come to if

04:14.040 --> 04:19.110
I ever have a project that's similar to it almost in every scenario where I've hired someone had a good

04:19.110 --> 04:23.790
experience with them and the project didn't work out I was able to find them another project that they

04:23.790 --> 04:24.490
could work on.

04:24.490 --> 04:29.820
So they still get repeat work they still did not have to establish the rapport with me.

04:30.030 --> 04:34.550
They have to re introduce themselves to whatever the new project is.

04:34.740 --> 04:35.790
But it doesn't really matter.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.130
They didn't have to find a client they've already found me.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.470
I just pass them on to the next project.

04:40.470 --> 04:45.150
So don't be squeamish when you use this term it's one of the best things you can put it's what freelancers

04:45.150 --> 04:50.030
really really look for they want long term clients and it's going to reflect that in your price.

04:50.030 --> 04:56.760
When you say that so obviously keep in mind as long as you think you're going to be contracting something

04:56.760 --> 05:02.430
else out in the future then chances are there's an opportunity for you to have a long term relationship

05:02.430 --> 05:03.530
with a contractor.

05:03.660 --> 05:04.740
That's usually the case.

05:04.810 --> 05:09.290
Ninety five the time OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
