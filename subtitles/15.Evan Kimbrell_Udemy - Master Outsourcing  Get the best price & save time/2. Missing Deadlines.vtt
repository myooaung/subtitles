00:09.260 --> 00:13.610
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about another common scenario

00:13.610 --> 00:16.250
that could happen in the worst case scenario.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.620
This is when you have a freelancer or a contractor or outsource firm and they're consistently missing

00:21.620 --> 00:22.610
deadlines.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.230
Now in general if you're outsourcing that you need to know that you should be at least a little bit

00:27.230 --> 00:29.950
flexible with your deadlines.

00:30.390 --> 00:35.750
And if you're really a stickler for time and when things get done then you need to be working with someone

00:35.750 --> 00:39.880
you at least have a rapport with or someone you know shows up on time.

00:39.920 --> 00:47.000
Typically when you do the $50 test I like to give freelancers a real small segment of things to work

00:47.000 --> 00:54.350
on just too many other things test to see how quickly they can get it done whether or not they can match

00:54.380 --> 00:56.840
the deadline that they themselves have made.

00:56.840 --> 01:02.720
So if you follow the $50 test you'll probably know whether or not this person hits their deadlines or

01:02.720 --> 01:03.350
not.

01:03.350 --> 01:09.130
Now of course it can always happen that you know the did perfectly on the $50 test but then later they

01:09.140 --> 01:14.930
have family issues or something else is happening that creates some tension with the deadlines.

01:14.930 --> 01:19.710
So first off you understand if they are missing their deadlines there's typically only three things.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.460
In my experience that are happening.

01:22.490 --> 01:29.660
One is that they are having something like a personal emergency or they're having to spend a lot of

01:29.660 --> 01:32.740
their time elsewhere in life it could be another project.

01:32.870 --> 01:38.030
It could be moving it could be traveling it could be something else that's sucking up their time.

01:38.030 --> 01:42.380
The second thing could be that they have overextended themselves in terms of the project.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.190
It's a lot more complicated than they thought.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.920
And they're finding or that they're finding it's a lot more tedious than they thought.

01:48.920 --> 01:55.010
So their previous estimates of their timeline might be inaccurate because they're finding out that it's

01:55.010 --> 01:55.970
a lot harder.

01:55.970 --> 02:01.040
And the last thing is that you might just have a freelancer who is not particularly motivated to finish

02:01.040 --> 02:03.020
your project on time.

02:03.050 --> 02:08.600
This is the least likely scenario because if you did a good job of looking at their past work vetting

02:08.600 --> 02:14.060
them assessing them and making a good decision about a freelancer and you did the $50 test you should

02:14.060 --> 02:18.800
know whether or not this person is mature and whether or not they're going to run out of gas halfway

02:18.800 --> 02:23.940
through their project or just from the get go not be serious about delivering on time.

02:23.990 --> 02:27.180
So the likelihood that it's just an amateur freelancer.

02:27.650 --> 02:31.760
It's possible if you pick someone who has no reviews they have no skin in the game.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.840
There might be even just testing out this whole freelancer thing and they realize halfway through that

02:35.840 --> 02:37.770
they just can't do it anymore.

02:37.910 --> 02:41.270
The best way to get around this is just to do some basic vetting.

02:41.270 --> 02:45.650
Make sure you have lots of beer on your bids and your projects and make sure you pick someone who has

02:45.650 --> 02:52.220
a track record now dealing with someone who has an external life event that's a lot trickier.

02:52.250 --> 02:57.260
You need to basically have an open communication with them if they're missing deadlines to figure out

02:57.260 --> 02:59.830
what it is that's causing them to miss the deadlines.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.450
And if they do tell you that it's a family issue.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.510
Make sure that you're skeptical when I say skeptical.

03:05.510 --> 03:10.970
I mean it is very plausible that they have family issues that does happen quite often.

03:10.970 --> 03:16.820
However those things typically don't just come up out of the blue and if they do and the person is a

03:16.820 --> 03:22.370
good freelancer they would have told you every step of the way they wouldn't just tell you after you

03:22.370 --> 03:24.830
asked why are you missing your deadlines.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.200
Let's say you're freelancer's wife is having a baby.

03:27.230 --> 03:32.140
They would probably tell you upfront when that's happening that they're pregnant.

03:32.150 --> 03:36.620
They're expecting they might even tell you a couple of days afterwards.

03:36.620 --> 03:39.680
The point is they will tell you you don't have to ask.

03:39.740 --> 03:45.050
Now if they keep telling you oh family event Oh family event it might be the case that they're just

03:45.050 --> 03:49.730
using that as a coverall excuse to cover the fact that they're just missing their deadlines.

03:49.730 --> 03:55.160
A lot of times they'll use it to cover up what's happening which is that they're spending time on another

03:55.160 --> 03:56.130
project.

03:56.270 --> 04:00.200
What you need to do is you need to be frank with them and if it is the case you're getting a repeated

04:00.200 --> 04:03.800
excuse saying I have a family event or a family problem.

04:03.800 --> 04:08.900
You need to say to them are you missing deadlines because you have other project work.

04:08.900 --> 04:14.120
Explain to them that you understand that freelancers take on multiple projects at once and then just

04:14.120 --> 04:18.350
ask them the question if it is the case that they are working on other projects that you need to make

04:18.350 --> 04:24.250
sure that they understand that they misrepresented themselves upfront.

04:24.260 --> 04:32.070
You need to make sure that they understand that this is not OK and that they should have told you beforehand.

04:32.240 --> 04:38.440
In general you should always make sure that the person is responsive and the person is not overly busy.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.910
And we deal with that previously in the course by looking at things like responsiveness by looking at

04:43.910 --> 04:49.290
reviews looking at their track records giving them small pieces of things to work on.

04:49.310 --> 04:54.530
And if you do that you can just figure out very quickly whether or not there's someone who does take

04:54.530 --> 04:57.170
on other projects that they don't tell you about.

04:57.170 --> 05:01.420
The point here though is that you need to facilitate communication as much as possible.

05:01.490 --> 05:06.140
If you do run into a landmine like this they're not doing their delivery deadlines and they admit to

05:06.140 --> 05:11.130
you that they have another project and need to have a frank with them about rescheduling your deadlines

05:11.970 --> 05:18.120
and potentially having monetary damages you might need to explain to them that every time they miss

05:18.120 --> 05:25.920
a deadline this is what it cost you and use that as a basic way of incentivizing them to re prioritize

05:25.920 --> 05:27.530
your project over the other.

05:27.550 --> 05:33.300
Now there's really not a ton you can do if this is the case that they have another project and you're

05:33.300 --> 05:37.860
in it for the long haul you're in a project that's a long term really you can just try to make sure

05:37.860 --> 05:43.890
that they de-prioritize the other one or at least understand when they're done with the other one or

05:43.890 --> 05:47.930
why they thought that they could handle two at the same time but they can't.

05:48.220 --> 05:53.270
And then just try to re correct your course being flexible being communicative.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.290
Those are the things that are going to help you get through this.

05:55.290 --> 05:59.250
There are also the things that are going to help you prevent this from or from becoming a big problem.

05:59.250 --> 06:05.160
Now the other scenario was that they found out this is a lot more complicated and that's not something

06:05.160 --> 06:06.930
that's going to pop up very quickly.

06:06.930 --> 06:11.310
It's usually something that if they've missed a couple deadlines you need to ask them why they're missing

06:11.310 --> 06:13.600
them and you need to understand what's happening.

06:13.770 --> 06:18.270
And a lot of times they'll explain to you upfront that these sections took a lot longer and always trying

06:18.270 --> 06:23.240
to play them down and say oh it's just because of this one section yada yada yada.

06:23.460 --> 06:24.600
I'll be on schedule.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.610
Going forward you need to explain to them that it's not necessarily that they hit their deadlines it's

06:29.610 --> 06:35.000
that you know when they're going to be finished again don't ever try to outsource when you have hard

06:35.000 --> 06:39.380
core deadlines meaning if you miss a deadline the whole ship falls apart.

06:39.510 --> 06:41.450
Your entire company collapses.

06:41.490 --> 06:46.110
You need to always outsource when you have a least a little bit of flexibility or a really strong rapport

06:46.110 --> 06:47.580
with the person you're working with.

06:47.580 --> 06:52.530
So as long as they understand that it's not about deadlines it's about when you should expect the work

06:52.530 --> 07:00.420
to be done then you can open up in a kind of a communication about readjusting your deadlines readjusting

07:00.420 --> 07:05.390
your expectations and then that should be the case that it should become easier.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.510
The only downside to this is you might just have to downgrade your expectations as to how fast your

07:09.510 --> 07:10.600
project gets done.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.850
And to be honest this happens all the time in projects all the time.

07:14.850 --> 07:19.740
People jump in and they realize it's a lot more complicated than they thought and it might take an extra

07:19.740 --> 07:21.700
week two weeks or even a month.

07:21.720 --> 07:28.650
Web projects online projects a lot of times they are very very hard to predict upfront how hard it's

07:28.650 --> 07:32.700
going to be you just don't know how complex something is going to be and that's how you spend a lot

07:32.700 --> 07:33.550
of time with it.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.320
So try to be flexible.

07:35.430 --> 07:41.640
Try to establish as much communication as you can try to figure out what exactly is causing the delay

07:42.360 --> 07:43.680
and then try to limit it.

07:43.680 --> 07:49.200
Once you've figured out what exactly the problem is if it's something that's unfixable Well then you

07:49.200 --> 07:55.140
probably saw this coming down the road and you probably if you've used a milestone system have prevented

07:55.140 --> 07:57.210
yourself from taking a large hit on it.

07:57.270 --> 08:01.610
But in the vast majority of cases it can be fixed it can be remedied.

08:01.610 --> 08:05.300
You might just have to downgrade your expectations about when the project's going to be done.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.290
Questions Comments anything just post in the group discussion.
