00:06.720 --> 00:09.330
All right so the rest of it really is just kind of a tiny little details.

00:09.330 --> 00:12.810
It's up to you how much detail you honestly want to put in here.

00:13.860 --> 00:20.910
We can you know let's just pretend like this is here's the placeholder for the image.

00:20.910 --> 00:26.440
Whoever made the video can add in text again.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.360
Right here in the name of the video

00:36.380 --> 00:43.710
supersecret Web cam video because they want it to be a secret but they also want the entire world to

00:43.710 --> 00:45.460
see it.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.790
And realistically a much wider

00:50.560 --> 00:59.940
bear of this town has some space you can add those thumbs up and thumbs down.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.480
Just pick an icon to put it over here.

01:02.870 --> 01:09.700
You can even just search first thousands films is on and you can run it small.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.930
Makes more sense right.

01:12.430 --> 01:20.300
And can you even copy it there right next to it and then just find another icon.

01:20.320 --> 01:28.600
THOMES again thumbs down like the video then just stick someone's face on it because it's a web cam

01:28.600 --> 01:29.320
right.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.550
You get the drift now.

01:33.550 --> 01:42.690
So get widescreen whatever you can put an enormous amount of detail into balsamic if you want to.

01:42.690 --> 01:48.880
But as you've noticed that really did not take me a lot of time and I have a wireframe of a video.

01:48.900 --> 01:54.810
You're always you know put more time and effort into whatever you actually build yourself but once you

01:54.810 --> 01:59.670
actually get acquainted with it hopefully by now you are acquainted you can really move at lightning

01:59.670 --> 02:03.370
speed and you can really produce these very very quickly.

02:03.390 --> 02:08.940
Now if I you know wanted to make the next screen at YouTube now you know I could just go up to file

02:09.000 --> 02:14.100
clone current mock up and look I have the same exact thing and I can just move from here and start deleting

02:14.100 --> 02:20.660
things wherever I want and changing things around there is more functionality to bosonic.

02:20.670 --> 02:24.670
I just don't think it's something that you need to be.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.150
You don't need an in-depth Guide to it.

02:26.190 --> 02:30.570
You see what I did I learned you know you could learn this very quickly you could slap it together and

02:30.570 --> 02:32.640
that's kind of the beauty of balsamic.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.310
I don't want you to spend an enormous amount of time doing this.

02:35.310 --> 02:40.140
This is I were kind of shying away from some of the super professional hard core wire framing services

02:40.500 --> 02:44.870
and just moving towards this one which is just kind of fun and everybody kind of looks that it likes

02:44.880 --> 02:46.590
the design of it once it's all done.

02:46.590 --> 02:51.000
Now when you're done and you're happy with what you've got all you've got to do is just go up to file

02:51.630 --> 02:54.590
and you can save it as whatever you want it to be.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.080
Make sure to back it up if you guys are on an older computer.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.650
Make sure that you don't have tons and tons and tons of tabs open it can really kind of slow down your

03:01.650 --> 03:04.260
computer but otherwise just export it to whatever you want.

03:04.260 --> 03:07.740
I like PTF that's one of the easiest to view.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.300
Or you just do it as an image.

03:09.300 --> 03:13.040
That's what you end up sending your graphic designer or your developer and they will think you 1000

03:13.170 --> 03:18.330
times over.
