Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about one of the most important

00:15.110 --> 00:18.660
things in contracting and in outsourcing.

00:18.680 --> 00:24.100
So this thing is something I tell people all the time and I see people making this huge mistake.

00:24.110 --> 00:30.860
It's I mean you can very easily slip into and so you need to be very aware before you can go into the

00:30.860 --> 00:31.590
project.

00:31.640 --> 00:36.580
Your response rate sets the tone for the entire relationship.

00:36.600 --> 00:42.530
Now let me explain what I mean when you first post a project someone sends you a message.

00:42.620 --> 00:45.290
You respond they respond you respond.

00:45.290 --> 00:50.900
How much time is in between you hearing a message and you are responding.

00:51.020 --> 00:58.300
Now this is a very well-known sociological phenomenon when you use text messages when you use e-mails

00:58.310 --> 01:01.550
when you post in a group whatever it may be.

01:01.550 --> 01:07.380
If you signal a delay the other person will typically match that delay.

01:07.380 --> 01:11.950
Now this is especially true in freelancer relationships.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.250
You are the employer.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.040
And so it's up to you to set the tone for the relationship.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.720
Are you going to be very casual.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.280
Are you going to be very serious.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.760
Do you require lots of information.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.480
Do you respond quickly.

01:23.570 --> 01:28.880
There's a lot of different aspects and variations to every single working arrangement.

01:28.940 --> 01:32.460
So a freelancer needs to adapt to the employer.

01:32.540 --> 01:37.970
And if you signal something to them say you're signaling casual language they'll most likely respond

01:37.970 --> 01:39.650
in casual language.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.980
That's just a natural order of things.

01:41.990 --> 01:45.700
Now response rate works in the same exact way.

01:45.890 --> 01:51.260
If you take a day to respond you're freelancers going to take a day to respond you take a week to respond

01:51.260 --> 01:53.460
your freelancer is going to take a week to respond.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.160
Why.

01:54.170 --> 02:00.610
Because you're signaling to them that it's OK to literally take a week before responding to something.

02:00.620 --> 02:06.320
Now you might not think that's an issue but this is something that grows very very quickly and it becomes

02:06.320 --> 02:08.900
a problem very very quickly.

02:09.350 --> 02:14.500
If you say respond within a day during the first week and the second week it takes you two days.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.750
Third it takes you three days.

02:16.970 --> 02:22.160
What's going to end up happening is that every single subsequent week you're going to have your communication

02:22.160 --> 02:27.690
speed is going to slow down to the point at which you're literally commuting four times a month.

02:28.530 --> 02:32.240
That is incredibly slow for virtually any project.

02:32.250 --> 02:38.250
There have been many many cases where I had a project that had I had a responsive relationship and we

02:38.250 --> 02:40.610
were communicating within 30 minutes of each other.

02:40.680 --> 02:46.200
We would have been done in a day but because I made the mistake of not responding within two days I

02:46.200 --> 02:50.000
set the tone for the relationship and the project took a month.

02:50.010 --> 02:54.850
So now I mean think about it you really can't blame the freelancer for doing that again.

02:54.870 --> 02:58.740
They adapt to every single employer every single employer is different.

02:58.740 --> 03:04.620
So it's important for you to set the tone early and to show them that you care about the project so

03:04.650 --> 03:05.670
they should too.

03:05.670 --> 03:10.680
There's also a negative effect that in general they're not going to take the project as seriously if

03:10.680 --> 03:16.830
you're not on the ball with it subconsciously signals to them that this is not particularly an important

03:16.830 --> 03:17.660
thing to do.

03:17.670 --> 03:23.370
It might be a side project maybe they're doing this outside of their expertise that is generally how

03:23.370 --> 03:24.710
someone's going to think about it.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.380
So I can't stress this enough.

03:27.390 --> 03:32.370
I mean it even gets to the point where if you're going to launch something a launch a poster project

03:32.400 --> 03:37.290
and you're going to try to get it done within a week don't post it on a day that you know you're not

03:37.290 --> 03:41.460
going to be able to respond quickly don't even posted on the weekend if you're busy on weekends.

03:41.460 --> 03:41.940
Why.

03:41.940 --> 03:47.700
Because at the very beginning if you take 12 hours to respond you've now set the tone for a 12 hour

03:47.700 --> 03:48.780
response rate.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.250
You might be OK with that.

03:50.280 --> 03:50.710
Right.

03:50.730 --> 03:56.430
And if you are that's perfectly fine but there's no reason why you couldn't just limit that limit the

03:56.430 --> 04:01.680
cycle time and limit the project time in totality.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.060
OK.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.910
So take it seriously.

04:03.930 --> 04:10.740
Be conscious when you post a job and make sure that you respond as quickly as possible your projects

04:10.740 --> 04:16.560
will get done in a fraction of the time and you're freelancers are going to take this project a lot

04:16.560 --> 04:17.460
more seriously.

04:17.460 --> 04:22.020
They asked for a piece of information and you get it to them they're going to get back to you in the

04:22.020 --> 04:25.680
same expediency that you gave to them.

04:25.680 --> 04:38.860
So set the tone correctly have a successful project see in the next lecture.
