WEBVTT

00:06.170 --> 00:07.770
OK so let's talk about pages.

00:07.770 --> 00:12.640
Pages are one of the it's one of the sections that is definitely required.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.660
It's one of the sections that I in my experience it's much easier to handle when you've gone and done

00:18.660 --> 00:20.880
wireframe first.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.620
So again if this is something that you struggle with please do go to the end of the section and look

00:25.620 --> 00:27.930
at the wire framing section.

00:27.930 --> 00:33.720
You do not need to write your spec requirement your spec sheet first then the wireframe.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.690
You can always do it the other way around.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.230
That does end up helping quite a bit with this especially people who are not who are new to this but

00:40.230 --> 00:44.550
the whole idea behind pages is that we're going to list out every single page that we can think of in

00:44.550 --> 00:45.630
the application.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.730
There's a lot of room for error here.

00:47.820 --> 00:52.950
So if you forget about a page it's typically something that will come up during your first discussion

00:52.950 --> 00:58.610
with a developer or with a designer or whoever you outsourcing or contracting with.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.020
So don't worry if you forget about something.

01:01.020 --> 01:04.850
But also at this point you know we've already written our section on scope.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.760
So there's a good chance that you'll catch most of it because of your get to a point where you're stuck.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.050
You can always just scroll up and see all the functions you listed before.

01:13.110 --> 01:16.950
Think about it and think about what page you would go on and a lot of times you'll run into a function

01:16.980 --> 01:19.230
that you actually haven't listed a page for.

01:19.230 --> 01:26.650
So the way that I always do it is just list it out by page name and then a description description honestly

01:26.670 --> 01:28.110
is just one or two sentences.

01:28.110 --> 01:32.850
We don't need to get into depth with it really all it is is so that when a developer or someone giving

01:32.850 --> 01:39.240
you an estimate or is building off of this looks at it they can look and mentally see every single page

01:39.240 --> 01:44.230
that you have just to have a better idea of how big this application is.

01:44.340 --> 01:51.170
It helps them organize in their head and in their estimation what exactly is going to go into it.

01:51.190 --> 01:57.270
Now one thing that's important to note is that when you're doing an application functionality is one

01:57.270 --> 02:01.840
thing and it takes certain time to be able to say let someone log in or log out.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.030
But also there are multiple ways of handling that.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.960
Now you could have one page or they log in and it all happens on one page.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.280
You could have it on multiple pages.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.730
The more pages you have the more time it takes someone to build.

02:14.730 --> 02:20.430
So if you ever have the option of choosing fewer pages or more pages I usually decide to pick fewer

02:20.430 --> 02:21.390
pages.

02:21.390 --> 02:23.610
Now there's a there's obviously exceptions to this.

02:23.610 --> 02:29.070
You know if you have a user base that you want to kind of walk all along your process if it's someone

02:29.070 --> 02:35.550
that you if your users are people that you think need a little more hand-holding then more pages can

02:35.550 --> 02:36.580
be better.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.490
It's easier for them to fall that process but usually I say simpler is better.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.820
It's not going to balloon your student or Balloon your application to have multiple pages for the same

02:44.820 --> 02:45.390
thing.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.360
But it does it end up shaving off a little at a time if you can reduce the page number.

02:50.370 --> 02:54.330
So again you only need to write one to two sentences describe each page name.

02:54.390 --> 02:57.050
It is just so that they know what you're referring to.

02:57.060 --> 03:01.020
We're not listing how we don't need to go and capture the functions and then list them the page it doesn't

03:01.020 --> 03:02.160
really matter.

03:02.160 --> 03:07.490
So here are some questions that I've written that help people fill this section out.

03:07.560 --> 03:12.840
And this is kind of made for people the people that we work with and what they always seem to forget.

03:13.230 --> 03:18.150
So I always suggest that when you do go and write your pages section come back to this lecture look

03:18.150 --> 03:22.920
at the questions ask yourself the questions and see if you fit any of these questions and if you're

03:22.920 --> 03:24.330
missing anything.

03:24.330 --> 03:29.010
So the first question is what is the first page the user sees and this is something that people frequently

03:29.010 --> 03:32.930
forget about in an app in a mobile application.

03:32.940 --> 03:36.470
It could be a landing page in a web site.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.590
It could also be its own landing page it could be like a pitch page.

03:40.830 --> 03:45.550
It could be that page that kind of introduces what the concept is and only has one button.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.510
So keep in mind what does what does it look like.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.210
Does it look like any other random web site.

03:51.210 --> 03:55.090
If that's the case then you don't necessarily need to make a separate page for the first page.

03:55.290 --> 04:01.490
But if it has a landing page aspect to it or a splash page make sure that you list that out OK.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.880
Do you have any Sign-Up pages.

04:02.890 --> 04:04.840
No that's something that people always kind of forget about.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.590
Not only do people have to log in if you have an account system but they also have to register.

04:09.810 --> 04:15.450
And in both those cases you need to have pages that handle so they log in and get their password wrong.

04:15.450 --> 04:18.800
That's a separate page if they need to register.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.800
That's a separate page.

04:19.810 --> 04:26.880
Even There's even a page that says no confirmation we use signed up please check your email for verification.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.340
So make sure that you're handling that because virtually every application is going to have this unless

04:32.340 --> 04:36.190
you're just building a Web site that's informational In that case you don't really have sign up pages.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.770
So can they edit their account.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.780
That's another one I see people miss all the time.

04:40.780 --> 04:47.550
You usually in any application have an account button and you go up and you click at the top right where

04:47.550 --> 04:52.410
you can go and change your password change your information sometimes change a profile photo things

04:52.410 --> 04:53.390
like that.

04:53.430 --> 04:58.230
So make sure that you are facilitating that if you have accounts.

04:58.290 --> 05:03.830
Now if you have accounts are signing in and creating profiles and you don't have that that's going to

05:03.830 --> 05:08.270
be a problem your users are going to have some difficulty and you're going to have them e-mailing you

05:08.270 --> 05:13.960
saying hey I need to change my information or I lost my password or whatever it is.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.140
And that's actually not worth it.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.910
I mean do you think you're saving money by leaving this section out.

05:17.930 --> 05:23.530
Don't do it because actually you're going to lose time and time is money when everybody kind of avalanches

05:23.540 --> 05:27.400
on top of you asking you how do I do these basic functions OK.

05:27.440 --> 05:34.070
Do you have an about us or a contact form that is very common you know if you're a startup it's very

05:34.070 --> 05:36.260
common to give information about yourself.

05:36.470 --> 05:42.140
It kind of lends credibility to whatever you're doing it helps people understand that you're a small

05:42.140 --> 05:46.760
team or a big team or helps them get to know you.

05:46.790 --> 05:51.620
This is kind of par for the course and it's gotten to the point where if people don't do it it's looks

05:51.620 --> 05:52.520
weird.

05:52.520 --> 05:58.100
So you want to make sure that if that's something you want to display then absolutely do it.

05:58.100 --> 06:03.630
Not necessarily a mandatory page but keep in mind this is something that a lot of people forget about.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.440
Also similar contact form.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.870
How do they contact you.

06:07.810 --> 06:12.310
You know if you're trying to run a large operation maybe you need to have a contact form that has a

06:12.310 --> 06:17.620
decision tree or they have to you know change information first and then message you where they have

06:17.620 --> 06:21.790
to say for instance do they have an account or they don't have a account or what are they asking you

06:21.790 --> 06:25.220
a question about or who do they need to contact and then contact you.

06:25.390 --> 06:30.850
Or it's just a page I mean that's the most common thing I see is it's a page and it has a contact form

06:30.850 --> 06:37.450
you put name e-mail address subject and maybe and then your message ID and maybe one of those captured

06:37.450 --> 06:37.840
boxes.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.260
So do you have that do you want people to be able to contact you easily.

06:41.260 --> 06:46.830
Chances are you usually do some common pages that you should not forget about.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.790
A lot of people use how it works.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.320
That is something that's helpful.

06:50.320 --> 06:56.560
Now it's not absolutely crucial to the success of your application but it's something that is helpful

06:56.560 --> 06:59.860
for users to understand what's going on what do you do.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.720
How do I pay you money.

07:02.290 --> 07:05.780
And if you don't have that you might have a confused user base.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.020
Again not completely mandatory but very helpful.

07:08.050 --> 07:08.940
Same thing with an FAA.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.210
Q Do you need an FAA.

07:10.210 --> 07:16.120
Q Do you anticipate people being confused about what you do if you're trying to start a business build

07:16.120 --> 07:19.710
a web application that is rather complicated.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.890
It's very helpful to have an FAA queue.

07:22.090 --> 07:25.000
Pricing is another thing if you're building an online software.

07:25.050 --> 07:27.100
It's very nice to have a pricing page.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.630
That's something that you will get actually a lot of flack for if you're trying to sell something you

07:31.630 --> 07:33.020
don't ever say the price.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.150
OK.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.990
Do you have a separate page for every function or are some of them small enough for one page.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.580
That one's pretty easy the way that I kind of like to think of it is are you making an informational

07:45.580 --> 07:48.600
Web site that just tells information about who you are what you do.

07:48.730 --> 07:53.740
If that's the case then you typically will have separate pages for everything you know of a page that

07:53.740 --> 07:57.720
talks about this or a page that does this or a page that displays this.

07:57.730 --> 08:03.250
Now if you're building an application or someone creates an account logs in men has sort of a portal

08:03.280 --> 08:08.200
feel to it then chances are most of your functions are going to fit into a couple pages.

08:08.260 --> 08:11.740
You don't want a page for every single thing they can do.

08:11.980 --> 08:19.510
So in that case just kind of think about what you need and what would be overburdening your user what

08:19.510 --> 08:20.240
is too much.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.650
Now imagine you are a user and you're using your application.

08:23.650 --> 08:28.630
Do you really want to go to a separate tab or a separate page every time you want to say send a message

08:28.630 --> 08:33.360
or check some information or read information.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.370
Usually that's kind of over done.

08:35.380 --> 08:39.160
And this is one of those things that it helps if you do your wireframe first because when you go and

08:39.160 --> 08:43.480
start wireframe ing you start to realize you have a lot of space on the page.

08:43.630 --> 08:49.200
And so there's a lot of areas where you can fit in that functionality that we went over previously and

08:49.210 --> 08:51.920
you don't need to have a separate tab up in your head.

08:52.090 --> 08:55.480
And I wrote this down here because this is incredibly important.

08:55.510 --> 08:58.120
All refer to your function list when you get stuck.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.990
And if you have wireframe to refer to those as well so you don't your functionless and your wireframe.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.740
This section should be very very easy.

09:05.780 --> 09:05.990
OK.

09:06.090 --> 09:11.380
And I'll show you kind of how I would go about doing it with the fake application that we just made.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.720
So this is a mobile application.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.390
Keep in mind so I would say you know my first page would be.

09:17.500 --> 09:22.990
And I typically like to use conventions like this I'll just label them one through however many pages.

09:22.990 --> 09:27.910
So if they don't know the page name like the specific title you used for it because they can get kind

09:27.910 --> 09:32.770
of obscure and they have lots of pages it can just refer to the number and that's really quite helpful.

09:32.770 --> 09:41.410
So I would say the landing page landing page with Sign-Up screen with sign up on and remember.

09:41.410 --> 09:44.880
So now we look down at the question do they need to register register button.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.180
OK so that's the first page.

09:46.210 --> 09:50.650
And then what I'll do is I'll just give a just a quick description of it.

09:50.860 --> 10:03.440
First Pidge users use after opening the application for the first time lets them log in or count.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.500
It's a joke called the lovely view.

10:08.820 --> 10:09.070
OK.

10:09.070 --> 10:09.410
There you go.

10:09.410 --> 10:12.020
So that's page number one.

10:12.130 --> 10:15.010
Now again try to visualize this as a user.

10:15.010 --> 10:20.470
Now what would happen if I signed up I signed up I would go to the main screen that we described before

10:20.740 --> 10:25.720
if I did not sign up and had to register them I'd have to go to a registration page so we'll make sure

10:25.720 --> 10:29.500
that we have a registration page striation page.

10:29.760 --> 10:29.980
OK.

10:29.990 --> 10:38.140
And then in the scription I'm just going to give a limited effort explanation of what are the form the

10:38.230 --> 10:39.760
form information that I have to give.

10:39.760 --> 10:51.200
So collect information to create user account and then we could say have the option to fill out basic

10:51.770 --> 10:55.340
mation about themselves.

10:56.420 --> 11:05.330
And the option to create your account with Facebook I'm going to break my rule and add a third sentence

11:05.570 --> 11:07.380
which is fine because it's important.

11:07.390 --> 11:13.000
But then I would say something along the lines of must capture location.

11:13.010 --> 11:16.880
Remember this is a location based mobile application.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.380
OK.

11:17.570 --> 11:24.200
And then I would say we'll call this the main screen because once they get in to the page they're going

11:24.200 --> 11:31.100
to have the main screen where they have to do things like look at their matches message their matches

11:31.230 --> 11:37.010
etc. so you can also see where they can set their profiles so we'll just call it the main screen.

11:37.220 --> 11:41.570
Again it doesn't really matter what you name these things it's all that matters is your description

11:41.570 --> 11:42.530
makes sense.

11:42.530 --> 11:53.600
So in the main screen will say this is the main screen where the user sees their daily matches and can

11:53.750 --> 11:56.680
access their account page.

11:56.780 --> 11:57.620
OK.

11:58.190 --> 12:02.660
And we had a couple other pages and guys honestly if you if you get the point.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.040
Move along.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.300
You don't need to watch me do this entire thing.

12:06.340 --> 12:10.280
You just I understand that a lot of people are so new to this that they would really like to see me

12:10.280 --> 12:13.440
go from point one to point to 100.

12:13.640 --> 12:18.770
If you get it you can always just move along move on to the next lecture where we start talking about

12:18.830 --> 12:20.460
the user description.

12:20.460 --> 12:24.640
So after the main screen we now kind of recognize that there's a fork in the road.

12:24.680 --> 12:29.390
They get to look at other people's matching profiles or they can change their account information.

12:29.390 --> 12:40.580
So I will say Account Information page Pidge account information page we would say user can view their

12:40.610 --> 12:43.940
basic information change

12:45.990 --> 12:52.900
questionnaire answers and change their password.

12:53.450 --> 12:54.090
OK.

12:54.190 --> 12:59.290
And this is why this is so helpful to go in this process like you're a user because I've just uncovered

12:59.290 --> 13:00.460
something that I've missed.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.800
Right now is this change questionnaire answers.

13:03.830 --> 13:08.550
OK well I forgot to add that as a page that would actually be its own page.

13:08.830 --> 13:14.740
So we now have to decide where that goes is that after the registration page has that been between the

13:14.740 --> 13:17.680
landing page and the registration page I guess it doesn't really matter.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.480
We will just say it goes here to update all the numbers.

13:21.640 --> 13:26.460
So we'll say questionnaire screens again.

13:26.530 --> 13:30.260
We don't need if it's three screens of all the same functionality.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.570
It doesn't really matter we don't need to make three separate sections of it.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.280
And the questionnaires we have.

13:35.300 --> 13:39.520
And then we can say oh well we're asking questions they answer the questions this one through 10.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.900
How many questions did it ask.

13:41.020 --> 13:46.000
Well good thing we have a function section three screens of questions total of 25 questions.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.590
Great.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.190
OK.

13:47.200 --> 14:02.620
So user goes through three screens of questions totaling 25 questions or questions or one three or 10

14:02.620 --> 14:10.490
answers I would say submit button at the bottom for each page.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.160
OK great.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.600
So that one's done.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.810
Now we can go back to where we were.

14:16.630 --> 14:23.110
We will say this is the now we've seen our matches we can go and look at their profile.

14:23.320 --> 14:23.790
OK.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.750
So profile page of matches.

14:28.400 --> 14:39.440
And they all say and the description user can view the file of each match and we can say and see you

14:39.450 --> 14:47.120
know X Y Z information it's up to you you could describe whatever information you want to do you say

14:47.150 --> 14:53.690
oh they see their profile photo and they see a ranking.

14:53.690 --> 14:58.210
I think we said that it shows all their questions and they get to see a percentage.

14:58.220 --> 15:08.660
I think that's what we were saying so lists so we'll say like display's profile photo and Web site area

15:08.660 --> 15:13.470
to Provo area and lists and lists.

15:13.510 --> 15:17.810
There are question answers with that percentage.

15:18.130 --> 15:18.620
OK.

15:18.650 --> 15:25.010
And a lot of you who are a little more adept at noticing details we've uncovered a lot of functionality

15:25.010 --> 15:26.110
questions.

15:26.130 --> 15:31.100
You know if you've noticed that so like when I'm writing this out there's a lot of things that should

15:31.100 --> 15:34.290
be going to your head of what else is included in this.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.610
When I say display's profile photo what else is included.

15:37.610 --> 15:43.430
What happens when I click the profile photo does it zoom in does it become a light box when it displays

15:43.460 --> 15:44.200
area.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.730
What else does that mean.

15:45.740 --> 15:50.600
Does the display area and then say the distance between where I am and where they are.

15:50.750 --> 15:55.050
Is it the area they signed up with is the area that they are at right now.

15:55.070 --> 15:57.720
These are all things that you'll need to specify.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.320
You typically do these in the function section.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.350
So what I can do is I can go.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.550
I should probably specify this and then go up to the functions included and change it.

16:06.590 --> 16:09.350
Now if you forget some of this stuff don't worry.

16:09.350 --> 16:16.490
The best way of remedying that is to go back through your sections and reread these as you read them

16:16.490 --> 16:17.790
you'll get more questions.

16:17.870 --> 16:23.450
And as you make wireframe you'll start to give yourself more answers that all start to become a lot

16:23.450 --> 16:26.340
more clear as you go and you do more of this stuff.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.760
Also when you do talk to your developer you're going to want to go over this together or your designer

16:31.800 --> 16:36.500
and they'll notice things immediately because they have to build this literally.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.820
And so if there's anything missing they will ask you it's just generally a good idea that you get all

16:40.820 --> 16:46.220
this stuff done up front and not later because then later it can become an issue.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.510
We're going to cover in this course.

16:47.510 --> 16:52.100
How do you deal with the extra work so it's not a big deal but obviously it's it's an ideal.

16:52.100 --> 16:57.740
So we want to make sure that we get it all done up front and then we say lists or questions of the percentage

16:57.740 --> 17:03.790
again that was not really very specific right like what exactly does that look like what does it mean.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.630
Is it does it look exactly like the form that the person submitted.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.500
These are all things that you'll decide later on.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.340
OK and then the last thing and this is all kind of implied.

17:12.350 --> 17:14.390
And we didn't ever put this into the functions.

17:14.390 --> 17:17.600
But now that I realize it we should go back and probably put this in the function.

17:17.600 --> 17:25.470
So what we can say is message screen will go down.

17:26.430 --> 17:33.350
Screen where they can message each other.

17:33.580 --> 17:40.200
I think that we had originally said that the functionality that would connect you by email.

17:40.570 --> 17:44.770
Keep in mind guys we're not actually building this so if you changed your mind and you wanted a message

17:44.770 --> 17:49.240
screen we could change the message screen if we wanted to do it the other way around then I think it

17:49.240 --> 17:53.560
was it just connects you with an email so we could say that if I wanted to build a message screen I

17:53.560 --> 18:00.130
could say it's a screen or you message each other but then I wouldn't need to specify what is the screen

18:00.160 --> 18:03.760
roughly look like does it look like I message and what's app.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.770
Can I send a Mowgli's can I send photographs.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.730
How did those photographs display.

18:09.790 --> 18:12.370
Does it display when I've read their message.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.710
Does it display when it's been sent.

18:14.710 --> 18:17.040
What happens when these things fail.

18:17.050 --> 18:20.370
Now a good developer will look at this and say this is the phunk.

18:20.380 --> 18:24.730
The functionality set that I would suggest because there's a package out there that I can install for

18:24.730 --> 18:26.210
you and it makes it very simple.

18:26.290 --> 18:32.920
But it's always good that you check into this and you think about it as much as possible so we can say

18:32.920 --> 18:38.920
screen or the message other I'll go back and be true to the functionality we said before and what this

18:38.980 --> 18:45.820
essentially entails would be we go back to the last page and describe that but the message button message

18:45.850 --> 18:53.140
button at the bottom that populates e-mail worst dating app ever.

18:53.140 --> 18:58.020
But it doesn't matter we're just going over this to give you guys the gist of what we're doing.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.080
Okay great.

18:59.080 --> 19:04.480
So when you go make your page description make sure to pull up this lecture look at this right here

19:04.490 --> 19:09.400
make sure that you cover all your bases make sure that you have your functionless done before you do

19:09.400 --> 19:09.610
this.

19:09.610 --> 19:11.910
Otherwise it's going to be way too complicated.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.110
And if you've already on your wireframe That's great actually saves your time and time.

19:15.130 --> 19:23.240
Wireframe also if you kind of get burnt out on this stuff doing just text wireframe can be very very.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.220
I find them fun because it's visual.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.620
It's like you're painting a picture but except the pictures are a very ugly web site.

19:29.710 --> 19:34.960
I would suggest that if you get to a point where you're kind of stuck cause of any questions just post

19:34.960 --> 19:36.910
in the group discussion and I'll get to them.

19:36.910 --> 19:42.090
So in the next lecture.
