02:39.380 --> 02:43.080
Now in general if you're trying to outsource to say South Asia.

02:43.100 --> 02:50.150
Lower your expectations for how good their prose is going to be as long as they understand the gist

02:50.150 --> 02:50.440
of it.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.620
That's what you should be going for.

02:51.620 --> 02:56.760
So keep in mind it's all relative to your project and where you're trying to outsource to.

02:56.780 --> 03:02.330
But in general this is very helpful when you're down in the like two or three freelancers or even one

03:02.390 --> 03:05.750
and you just want to be 100 percent sure that you're on the same page.

03:05.780 --> 03:06.960
Just ask them hey.

03:06.980 --> 03:13.160
Repeat back to me what it is that you're building what it is that this project is supposed to do now

03:13.280 --> 03:19.850
how you actually do it is honestly the last thing I do right before I hire them is I just ask them Hey

03:19.850 --> 03:23.090
I just want to make sure that we don't have any misunderstandings.

03:23.090 --> 03:28.570
Do you mind just letting me know what exactly your work what you're going to work on.

03:28.730 --> 03:32.010
Or can you give me a summary of the project.

03:32.110 --> 03:36.530
Now it might sound a little bit weird but what you can do at the very end of that is you can give them

03:36.530 --> 03:41.690
a carrot and say you know I just want to make sure that you know there's no Miss understanding's as

03:41.720 --> 03:46.580
soon as we get through this we'll be ready to start or something like that so they understand that it's

03:46.580 --> 03:52.790
kind of like the final hurdle and you just want to make sure that this last potential issue is out of

03:52.790 --> 03:53.320
the way.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.260
OK guys let me know in your own experiments how all of this works.

03:57.260 --> 04:01.540
You post in the group discussion if it's an issue or you have some suggestions otherwise.

04:01.550 --> 04:10.670
See in the next lecture.
1.000
to understand the entirety of the system if they're only building one section.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.160
They just need to understand the section.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.780
The point here though is that we're going to see how again how thoughtful how articulate they are when

01:47.780 --> 01:53.600
they repeat it back and a lot of times you can essentially find some mines that would have been a problem

01:53.600 --> 01:54.280
later.

01:54.290 --> 02:00.050
A lot of times you can have freelancers who are you know A-okay the entire vetting process and at the

02:00.050 --> 02:04.880
very end of the process you ask and them repeat the project back and you find out they have absolutely

02:04.910 --> 02:11.180
no idea what they're doing or they have some very core misunderstandings about what your project is

02:11.420 --> 02:12.950
or what your product does.

02:12.950 --> 02:17.900
Now sometimes these are pretty innocuous things that aren't a huge deal but you have the opportunity

02:17.900 --> 02:21.590
to correct and sometimes they're absolutely huge.

02:21.590 --> 02:26.210
They're building something and they have no idea what it is or they're planning to build it backwards

02:26.210 --> 02:30.520
so what you can do is you can correct them if you want to stick with this freelancer.

02:30.560 --> 02:37.490
You can also get a final indication of whether or not you both understand what is going to happen and

02:37.490 --> 02:39.370
what you both expect out of it
