00:09.400 --> 00:10.870
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:10.870 --> 00:17.620
So in this lecture we're going to talk a little bit about best practices around what you should outsource

00:17.650 --> 00:18.790
and what you should not.

00:18.790 --> 00:25.250
So the biggest takeaway from this lecture is I'm going to go over what are the big rules around outsourcing.

00:25.300 --> 00:30.630
What are the things that if you knew it could prevent you from making a huge outsourcing mistake it's

00:30.640 --> 00:35.980
most important is to understand that there are certain scenarios that are completely inappropriate for

00:35.980 --> 00:39.050
outsourcing and are in general a bad idea.

00:39.100 --> 00:43.120
And then there are other scenarios where it's a fantastic idea and you're actually doing yourself a

00:43.120 --> 00:44.740
disservice by not outsourcing it.

00:44.740 --> 00:48.940
So the first thing to take into consideration when you can determine whether or not you should outsource

00:48.940 --> 00:50.550
or not you should.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.900
The first thing I'd always like to ask people is do you have enough money to outsource Now this might

00:55.900 --> 01:01.180
be a little bit of kind of a misnomer because you think outsourcing is saving money.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.500
So why is the first thing you ask about my budget.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.400
Well I'll just save you a lot of money but it's not free it still costs some money.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.160
You can still spend a lot of money.

01:11.170 --> 01:16.020
Outsourcing especially if you're trying to build say a large web application or you're trying to outsource

01:16.020 --> 01:18.020
a very large business process.

01:18.130 --> 01:23.260
So I mean I can't even really generalize on the whole as to how much money outsourcing will Seaview

01:23.540 --> 01:23.840
you know.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.620
I mean it could be anywhere from 40 percent savings to 90 95 percent savings.

01:28.630 --> 01:33.160
It kind of depends with how comfortable you are with outsourcing and what exactly you are outsourcing

01:33.160 --> 01:35.570
and obviously how you do it and what deals you strike.

01:35.590 --> 01:37.840
But in general you do need some money.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.890
This is not one of those scenarios where we're going to find someone to do it for free.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.180
I wish there were more scenarios like that and you know typically when someone comes into Sprint.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.920
And they simply don't have the budget I usually suggest outsourcing and they don't have the budget for

01:50.920 --> 01:51.120
that.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.320
I usually tell them hey what you're trying to build.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.370
It needs to shrink.

01:54.370 --> 01:56.080
So take your application.

01:56.110 --> 01:57.160
Reduce features.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.630
Focus on the core of what you're trying to build or do.

02:00.910 --> 02:02.220
And start from there.

02:02.230 --> 02:05.640
So take a moment to evaluate what is your budget.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.910
Is it more than zero.

02:08.350 --> 02:11.080
Does it fit in general with what you think.

02:11.260 --> 02:16.180
A very cheap version of what you could build is now later we're going to have lectures on how you can

02:16.180 --> 02:21.900
figure out what exactly this is going to cost and I give some pretty in detail examples of what app

02:21.940 --> 02:28.000
web applications I've had built before cost and to give you some kind of an idea of big application

02:28.000 --> 02:30.960
small application what are we talking about in terms of money.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.190
For most of you out there.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.010
Most of you guys listening to this course probably came from our other courses are you're trying to

02:36.010 --> 02:38.070
build a webapp mobile app.

02:38.140 --> 02:43.630
You know we're not talking hundreds of dollars but we're usually not talking tens of thousands really

02:43.630 --> 02:45.460
just kind of depends on what you're trying to build.

02:45.460 --> 02:52.120
The second thing I always usually like to ask is Is the technology of your application is at the core

02:52.120 --> 02:56.890
of what you're trying to build in the core of why our customer would value what you're trying to do

02:56.980 --> 02:57.270
now.

02:57.310 --> 03:03.130
If your end customer derives the majority of their value from your service or product or app and they

03:03.130 --> 03:09.450
derive it from the technology of that application then outsourcing is quite a bit harder to do.

03:09.580 --> 03:14.910
And you need to focus on using outsource outsourcing and outsourcing techniques to help you with smaller

03:14.930 --> 03:18.440
more auxilary processes related to your main application.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.940
Now you might be asking yourself What am I talking about.

03:20.950 --> 03:26.280
I'll give you some examples so if you use the application called Shazam.

03:26.410 --> 03:29.030
That's a great example of something you should not outsource.

03:29.110 --> 03:35.230
So when I was saying that the consumer or your customer derives most of their value off of the technology

03:35.230 --> 03:39.910
of what you're building Chisholm's a great example Shazam is that mobile application or it used to be

03:39.910 --> 03:45.970
a web application and what it does is it listens to a song and it uses this kind of waveform technology

03:45.970 --> 03:49.410
to match it to a database to tell a person what song it is.

03:49.420 --> 03:51.260
So it's just Ames case.

03:51.400 --> 03:56.640
The technology right there is proprietary it's the core reason why someone uses it.

03:56.680 --> 04:02.890
Now the rest of the application the buttons the signs the you know all the smaller features that just

04:02.890 --> 04:04.600
gets you to that technology.

04:04.630 --> 04:11.230
Those are not core but the core technology of the matching system that is the reason why people care

04:11.230 --> 04:13.930
about Shiism if they didn't have that we wouldn't be talking about it.

04:13.950 --> 04:15.500
I'll give you another example.

04:15.550 --> 04:20.770
We had a student in another course bring up anti-virus software is an advantage that outsource anti-virus

04:20.770 --> 04:25.610
software as if you were going to try to build a software or some system that could detect viruses.

04:25.630 --> 04:29.710
That's another one that's not a good candidate for outsourcing.

04:29.950 --> 04:30.450
Why.

04:30.490 --> 04:36.580
Well because the success of your application and the reason why people will use it ultimately comes

04:36.580 --> 04:41.140
down to how complex and how well refined your technology is.

04:41.140 --> 04:47.770
So an anti-virus It's constantly updating algorithms you're constantly updating the way that it determines

04:47.770 --> 04:50.080
what a virus is and the way gets rid of it.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.850
It's not one of those projects that you build it once and it's good for 10 years it's a project that's

04:54.850 --> 04:57.460
constantly going to be iterating.

04:57.490 --> 05:02.920
And again the technology itself is the core reason why it's good and why it makes money.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.880
Last example Face dot com is a great example.

05:06.880 --> 05:14.110
This is a technology that existed where it could match someone's face to other photographs of the same

05:14.110 --> 05:17.500
person so it could basically determine who you are.

05:17.590 --> 05:23.260
And it would use really interesting calculations and algorithms to match distance between your eyes

05:23.260 --> 05:27.060
and your mouth and is really good even doing it at like angles and things like that.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.620
So now faced Dotcom is actually integrated into Facebook I'm sure you use Facebook and that's the technology

05:32.620 --> 05:35.720
they actually use to match your face into auto tag.

05:36.070 --> 05:41.350
So FaceTime column is a great example of a something you could not outsource as you're trying to compete

05:41.350 --> 05:47.890
with dot com and you wanted to make a system that could match people's faces again core reason why your

05:47.950 --> 05:53.710
application or your product succeeds or fails and the reason why consumers use it is whether or not

05:53.710 --> 05:58.810
it can match your face and do that well and that's something that's constantly going to need improvement

05:58.840 --> 06:01.940
and constantly going to need to have tinkering with.

06:01.960 --> 06:07.480
I bring that one up because at Sprint we were actually asked after face to face dotcom got bought to

06:07.480 --> 06:11.230
build an alternative to dot com.

06:11.230 --> 06:16.840
That's why we realized it's one of those things that would be impossible if you had an external organization

06:17.050 --> 06:19.630
or external freelancer build for yourself.

06:19.630 --> 06:26.950
Now the core reason why these are bad situations for outsourcing is because when you outsource you're

06:26.980 --> 06:32.710
not only going to have a communication gap you're also going to have a relay process.

06:32.710 --> 06:33.730
Something's wrong.

06:33.730 --> 06:37.890
You notice you tell your contractor there's always a delay.

06:37.900 --> 06:44.680
And the more delays you have the harder and slower it will take to make constant updates and iterations.

06:44.680 --> 06:51.340
So if the core technology constantly needs to change and it's very advanced that is something that would

06:51.340 --> 06:58.570
very much suffer from being in a vendor purchaser kind of relationship a contractor or entrepreneur

06:58.720 --> 07:00.110
or company relationship.

07:00.160 --> 07:06.400
And this brings me to the third thing I always ask people will your business crumble if what you're

07:06.400 --> 07:08.540
outsourcing does not work.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.380
Now it's really just kind of like the Jinggoy theory right.

07:12.640 --> 07:18.250
If I remove this tiny little piece will ever come crashing down and that's a very important question

07:18.250 --> 07:24.040
to ask yourself when you outsource and this applies not only to web application mobile application development.

07:24.190 --> 07:28.030
It'd be wise to promotion it applies to advertising.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.910
As CEO we're pr.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.920
Any of those auxillary services accounting for example.

07:32.920 --> 07:38.590
Now if you know if you had a situation where it was done poorly came late would that seriously hurt

07:38.620 --> 07:43.390
your organization and not just inconvenience it because if you have inefficiencies in any department

07:43.390 --> 07:48.630
of your company or your business or whatever you're doing that can affect other departments.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.050
I'm talking about Will.

07:50.110 --> 07:51.550
Will the curtain come down.

07:51.550 --> 07:53.740
Will everything come to a close.

07:53.980 --> 07:59.770
If this is not delivered on time correctly if that's the case that is something you should probably

07:59.770 --> 08:03.570
think about doing in-house hiring in-house or figuring out to do yourself.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.910
Not to say that you can't do it outsourced.

08:06.100 --> 08:10.810
It's just typically one of those cases were I when I hear that I say that's a little bit more risky.

08:10.810 --> 08:15.000
The last thing I usually like to ask people is what you're building.

08:15.010 --> 08:20.130
A first of a kind and technology meaning I'm building something.

08:20.140 --> 08:23.830
It's never been done before and that's what I'm going to go forward with.

08:23.830 --> 08:26.820
That is typically not something that you want to outsource.

08:26.920 --> 08:32.380
Now if you're trying to build a social network for let's say moms OK and you're saying that's never

08:32.380 --> 08:33.280
been done before.

08:33.310 --> 08:34.600
That's not what I'm talking about.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.180
I'm talking about the core technology of your service or your product.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.220
Has that been done before of course social networking has been done it's been done 100 times.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.910
I'm talking about is what makes your whole thing work.

08:46.930 --> 08:51.570
What makes it so valuable is that something that has been done before.

08:51.580 --> 08:55.270
Now the reason why I say this is because outsourcing and one of the tricks we're going to teach you

08:55.270 --> 09:02.500
in this course is using comparable services and comparable functions to not only make your communication

09:02.500 --> 09:07.150
more efficient but also to reduce the price of your application or whatever you're getting done now

09:07.420 --> 09:09.350
it's never been done before then.

09:09.430 --> 09:15.010
It's one of those cases where you can't actually show the comparable function and somewhere else to

09:15.010 --> 09:15.790
a developer.

09:15.910 --> 09:18.830
So you have to strike a bit from scratch.

09:18.930 --> 09:25.300
Now that in and of itself is not really the biggest problem the biggest problem is the estimate process.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.560
Now if you came to spread Kagan said hey I want to build something that's never been done before.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.630
How long is it going to take you to build.

09:31.630 --> 09:34.070
That's almost an impossible question to ask.

09:34.180 --> 09:34.620
Why.

09:34.630 --> 09:35.920
Because we have to research it.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.920
We have to develop new techniques and that's impossible to tell how long it's going to take us to research

09:42.250 --> 09:44.380
how complex this ends up being.

09:44.530 --> 09:48.520
And when we're going to arrive at this kind of eureka moment where everything clicks together and then

09:48.520 --> 09:49.280
we build it.

09:49.300 --> 09:55.690
So I say it's a bad idea for outsourcing because what ends up happening is you know it could be 10 percent

09:55.690 --> 10:01.300
of the time you pay for is actually spent building it and 90 percent of the time could be researching

10:01.300 --> 10:01.440
it.

10:01.450 --> 10:04.510
So it's a very inefficient way of doing it.

10:04.510 --> 10:10.970
It's also a problem then when you're outsourced vendor or outsource company they're the ones that have

10:10.970 --> 10:12.800
the know how and how to build this.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.660
So now if you're planning on having a long term relationship with an outsourced or contractor company

10:17.930 --> 10:19.450
that's perfectly fine then right.

10:19.460 --> 10:23.090
But if this is something you're just doing to get your business off the ground you might have issues

10:23.090 --> 10:23.870
later down the road.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.560
Now on the flip side what are good things to outsource.

10:26.570 --> 10:28.670
Well I actually think it's pretty simple.

10:28.670 --> 10:34.670
It's quite literally everything that didn't fit into the other four categories that I just came up with

10:35.120 --> 10:39.810
Typically things that are good for outsourcing are things that you've seen be built before.

10:40.110 --> 10:43.690
It's you know web application development it's mobile application development promotion.

10:43.700 --> 10:50.930
It's testing it's marketing it's really any type of process that you can define relatively well and

10:50.930 --> 10:55.850
you want to save money on really the sky's kind of the limit when it comes to what you can do with outsourcing.

10:55.850 --> 11:00.470
I'm always amazed every time I see outsourced firms and what they're building and how they're getting

11:00.470 --> 11:06.560
more and more integrated into modern companies today I'm obviously a huge fan of outsourcing and that's

11:06.560 --> 11:11.180
why I'm creating this course and that's why I think it's something that everybody can benefit from it's

11:11.180 --> 11:16.610
going to almost immediately once you develop the skills and this course help you save money save time

11:16.610 --> 11:18.360
get your projects done faster.

11:18.390 --> 11:22.130
But it's obvious that there are some situations where it's not worth doing.

11:22.130 --> 11:25.430
You can't outsource 100 percent of everything you do.

11:25.640 --> 11:30.560
And that's typically because something in your business or your project or your entrepreneurial idea

11:31.010 --> 11:34.840
is going to fall on or on those four no no categories that I just brought up.

11:34.910 --> 11:35.220
OK.

11:35.240 --> 11:40.210
So when you're evaluating your project for building out keep this in mind think about whether or not

11:40.220 --> 11:42.360
it matches any of those four criteria.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.340
Any other questions.

11:43.340 --> 11:49.720
There are obviously other ways other you know things that would prevent you from outsourcing this effectively.

11:49.730 --> 11:55.300
These are just the big four that I think are the trickiest to kind of figure how.

11:55.460 --> 11:59.540
And they're the ones that I've seen happen to people over and over and over again even seasoned veterans

11:59.540 --> 12:00.010
so.

12:00.190 --> 12:10.250
See you guys in the next lecture.
