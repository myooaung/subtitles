00:05.750 --> 00:06.970
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:06.980 --> 00:12.380
So in this lecture we're going to talk about response rate and I'm going to show you some real examples

00:12.590 --> 00:16.040
of how different contractors under different scenarios respond.

00:16.040 --> 00:21.380
Now response rate is incredibly important if I haven't already made that point before but I'm going

00:21.380 --> 00:24.950
to show you what kind of an impact it has on your project.

00:24.950 --> 00:30.170
I'm going to show you some examples where some people respond very quickly and some don't.

00:30.290 --> 00:35.230
It's really important to understand this and know what to look for no what to ignore.

00:35.330 --> 00:35.750
OK.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.540
Let's go to screencast.

00:37.770 --> 00:42.720
All right welcome back to the course so in this lecture I want to talk just a little bit about how you

00:42.720 --> 00:49.450
can monitor a response rate and use that as one of your criteria for determining who is a good freelancer

00:49.450 --> 00:51.560
or what's a good proposal.

00:51.570 --> 00:56.490
So typically one of the things I suggest doing is a best practice is immediately after you list your

00:56.490 --> 01:03.450
post your job will start to get bids and this is why I suggested previously in the course that you only

01:03.450 --> 01:09.060
list these job postings when you know you're going to a block of time to actually respond to them because

01:09.240 --> 01:11.910
obviously your response rate is very important.

01:11.910 --> 01:17.260
But it's really important because you can sniff out who exactly is away from the keyboard all the time.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.490
And what is your relationship going forward.

01:20.490 --> 01:22.000
Probably going to be like.

01:22.170 --> 01:26.820
So after you've gone through your initial proposals and using the techniques that we covered a little

01:26.820 --> 01:30.030
bit in the last lecture you're going to look for relevancy.

01:30.030 --> 01:33.000
You're going to look for message fatigue.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.970
You're going to look for poorly constructed sentences or sections I just don't make a ton of sense to

01:38.970 --> 01:40.080
you.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.240
One thing I'd like to do is pretty much immediately once someone has pass the sniff test I like to send

01:45.240 --> 01:48.930
them a message and that message might be completely redundant.

01:48.930 --> 01:53.770
It might just be me asking a question that I don't think was answered in their proposal.

01:53.820 --> 01:57.700
It might be something as simple as where are you located.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.670
What do you think of the project.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.650
Hey thanks for your message.

02:01.650 --> 02:02.870
Anything at all.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.330
Basically what I'm doing is I'm testing to see what exactly is their response rate going to be what

02:09.330 --> 02:15.960
you'll find often is that if someone is mass bidding and they're doing mass proposals they might not

02:16.050 --> 02:22.080
respond very quickly and you can kind of catch them because they maybe they posted 50 in an hour and

02:22.170 --> 02:27.000
they're not expecting you to respond very quickly and you can obviously tell it because they're trying

02:27.030 --> 02:28.830
to go for a volume play.

02:28.830 --> 02:32.130
They're focusing on getting as many bids out as possible.

02:32.190 --> 02:36.840
So here's an example of someone that I just immediately messaged right off the bat.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.160
So right off the bat I just had to ask them.

02:39.270 --> 02:42.910
Previously we've talked to there's a mismatch between our language skills and where the list is out.

02:43.050 --> 02:45.070
So I wanted to ask for clarification.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.820
And as you can tell I asked it for 11 and they responded 4:49.

02:48.840 --> 02:54.750
That's pretty good I responded quite literally I think 10 minutes within from the point at which they

02:54.750 --> 02:59.730
submitted the bid so them being able to respond in 30 minutes.

02:59.730 --> 03:00.370
That's good.

03:00.370 --> 03:05.040
Not fantastic but that does show that they actually are paying attention and they're not mass bidding

03:05.250 --> 03:06.180
that's typically good.

03:06.180 --> 03:11.820
So that would be a plus for this person although you'll notice up here is that I asked a question he

03:11.820 --> 03:15.870
responded That's great I responded and then they never responded again.

03:15.870 --> 03:18.510
So maybe they lost interest maybe they got busy.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.980
Whatever it doesn't really matter.

03:19.980 --> 03:23.940
The more conversation you have with them you're giving them more opportunities to drop out.

03:23.970 --> 03:27.210
And that's a good thing because if they're willing to drop out that's not something you want to work

03:27.210 --> 03:27.660
with.

03:28.700 --> 03:34.420
So give an example of where the response rate test failed quite miserably.

03:34.430 --> 03:42.620
This this proposal from x x x x x x x if he couldn't tell how professional it was to begin with what

03:42.620 --> 03:45.080
I did as I just immediately message them.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.120
So I just immediately message them as you can see four or three I think their bid came out came in at

03:50.120 --> 03:57.830
four o'clock so literally two minutes later I message them and I just pointed out the fact that they

03:57.830 --> 04:03.510
didn't divide their their estimate by the sections like I'd asked.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.560
And the second thing was they never answered whether or not they'd worked for Twilio which is something

04:06.560 --> 04:08.420
I specifically asked for.

04:08.420 --> 04:13.190
So as you can see then their response came in seven hours later which is kind of crazy considering that

04:13.250 --> 04:15.720
they're probably online currently and bidding.

04:15.770 --> 04:21.770
It's possible that they were asleep or something like that but if they just bid and then you immediately

04:21.770 --> 04:23.270
responded they don't respond back.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.950
That's just it's very unlikely it's the case that they sent you a message.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.260
And as soon as they hit enter then their head hit a pillow and they fell asleep.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.210
So that's a very bad sign.

04:32.210 --> 04:34.060
And then you notice that it almost right off the bat.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.540
They don't actually answer any of the question.

04:36.590 --> 04:41.720
They just want immediately to get me off off the Elance system and onto Skype and that was something

04:41.720 --> 04:43.810
that I just did not want to do.

04:43.820 --> 04:47.810
So that's an easy way of testing responsiveness.

04:47.930 --> 04:50.580
You don't want a freelancer who's going to disappear.

04:50.660 --> 04:55.690
So what you can do from a very quick test is as if proposals will start rolling in.

04:55.730 --> 05:01.010
Use the previous criteria to pick high quality ones you can ignore the ones that clearly score poorly

05:01.010 --> 05:04.170
on the the kind of criteria we established in the last lecture.

05:04.190 --> 05:06.200
Send them a message literally anything.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.830
All you're doing is seeing how quickly they respond.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.440
I'll show you the person who we ended up working with.

05:12.460 --> 05:18.470
And you can see and as you can guess they responded very quickly which is exactly what we want right.

05:18.470 --> 05:22.350
We want to make sure that their response of their at their computer.

05:22.490 --> 05:26.420
So quite literally at 1:41 a.m. I think they've been around 130.

05:26.420 --> 05:27.970
I posted a message.

05:28.010 --> 05:34.250
They responded pretty much within 30 minutes 34 minutes which is great considering that it's 2:00 in

05:34.250 --> 05:35.450
the morning where they're sending it.

05:35.450 --> 05:38.470
So that would be an example of that.

05:38.510 --> 05:41.030
Anything under 30 minutes is great within an hour.

05:41.060 --> 05:48.590
Still quite good if it's several hours probably a bad indication so use the response rate technique

05:48.620 --> 05:52.460
to very quickly kind of poke them see how quickly they respond.

05:52.460 --> 05:57.470
It's very helpful if you have five people that have passed your original test and you sent a response

05:57.470 --> 06:01.350
rate to a response rate test all five of them maybe three fail.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.500
And so now you're down to two.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.520
The whole idea behind this is we're trying to find the best freelancer and the best person to do your

06:07.520 --> 06:08.660
job.

06:08.690 --> 06:14.660
So that's usually a very good technique to figure out how actually committed they are to what they're

06:14.660 --> 06:17.470
bidding on and how committed they are to getting you as a client.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.120
So all right.

06:18.130 --> 06:18.860
See in the next lecture.
