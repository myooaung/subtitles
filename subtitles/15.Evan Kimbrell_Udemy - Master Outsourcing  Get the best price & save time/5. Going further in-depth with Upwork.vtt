00:05.660 --> 00:07.590
And messages it just have a message section.

00:07.590 --> 00:16.230
I don't like how it's separated out because on here it's like separate it out to where you have to go

00:16.230 --> 00:18.780
to your messages section to message them.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.150
And every time they message you it shows up in your message section.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.840
It just doesn't make sense to me that it's separated out.

00:24.180 --> 00:32.190
But one advantage though is that you don't have to go through finding your project finding the person

00:32.190 --> 00:38.010
finding the screen send them a message you can just do this and send it to whoever you want.

00:38.010 --> 00:42.730
Or you know someone that you've hired in the past or someone you've communicated with in the past I

00:42.780 --> 00:52.930
can just send them a message get to work etc. etc. that can be a little bit helpful.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.410
See similar to Lance and in this out as well.

00:55.650 --> 01:02.370
You have the ability to search for freelancers in jobs that kind of the same logic applies to you Lance

01:02.400 --> 01:05.090
freelancers great if you want to search for individual people.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.640
So like we used the example before let's search for Twilio in your search for jobs you can do the same

01:11.640 --> 01:18.560
thing and you can borrow their their specifications or adopt some of the things they use that you like.

01:18.720 --> 01:25.500
I like the ability to drill down on oDesk a little bit more than Elance and I'll show you why they just

01:25.500 --> 01:29.520
give you a lot more control so I can just do a slider and how much I own to pay if they don't want to

01:29.520 --> 01:38.040
pay more than $20 an hour and my hours bill they can set how long they've you know how many they've

01:38.210 --> 01:39.050
they've built.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.840
This is a big one for me.

01:42.150 --> 01:47.040
You can ask by When's the last time that they logged on to oDesk and did something you can't do on L.A.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.170
you can't go on a freelancer because oDesk tracks their movements a lot more than the other two.

01:52.230 --> 01:55.890
You can make sure that this person is active on their system.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.950
You might think that's you know why would I want to know that.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.670
It's actually quite important.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.120
Someone who is active on the system is going to be more responsive it's someone who is not going to

02:03.120 --> 02:07.800
disappear on you someone you know that when you message at 10:00 p.m. They're good respond by 11:00

02:07.800 --> 02:12.930
p.m. on elance you don't know if that person made their account and hasn't checked it in six months.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.870
It's kind of impossible to tell sometimes.

02:16.020 --> 02:19.320
And this is also a really cool benefit.

02:19.320 --> 02:25.710
This new contact them they have the green and the yellow and the red dots next the contact.

02:25.710 --> 02:32.790
So like if I wanted to contact this guy Sourabh you can see that he replies within a day.

02:32.820 --> 02:37.890
That's awesome for me because I know maybe if I want to hire today or tomorrow I know that I can go

02:37.890 --> 02:40.300
out and recruit people directly.

02:40.530 --> 02:45.960
And I know that they're going to apply roughly within this time and so typically when I go in I recruit

02:45.960 --> 02:51.660
people to my job I will look for the people that have green stars.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.850
And I just skip all of that.

02:52.860 --> 02:58.100
Well the yellow and the red and lice they have really specific to what I need.

02:58.110 --> 03:01.030
But I can save a lot of time doing that.

03:01.050 --> 03:05.240
This is the way that you message people and recruit people.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.840
I always suggest that when you do a job posting and we'll do this later when we do the dry run when

03:09.840 --> 03:17.250
we go through and make an entire application I like doing this where I can message them and invite in

03:17.250 --> 03:23.340
this case I can create a job specifically for them and if I had a job that was active it would give

03:23.340 --> 03:27.420
me a screen asking to invite them specifically to it.

03:27.420 --> 03:31.470
ODesk Lummis how many people you can invite to your job.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.660
I think it's like 20 a day.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.450
So but it is quite nice.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.440
Just remember to log in every day and get your 20 done because that's dramatically going to increase

03:40.440 --> 03:43.780
the participation for people in your project.

03:43.820 --> 03:44.640
But this is kind of nice.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.370
I can send this person a specific job just for him see what he says.

03:48.370 --> 03:51.960
If he accepts it see if he denies it.

03:52.380 --> 04:01.320
All right so the last thing I want to show you is just how you can how odious streamlines all the information

04:01.320 --> 04:06.660
per freelancer so you can kind of keep track of everything about that person and your relationship with

04:06.660 --> 04:07.300
them.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.850
And I typically find this to be quite useful.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.170
So for me again I've to look for old jobs.

04:14.190 --> 04:16.880
I have been using oDesk.

04:17.440 --> 04:23.370
But here is an example of someone that I hired to do kind of as needed fixes.

04:23.370 --> 04:25.440
You can tell that guy was $13 an hour.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.140
He bills a lot.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.500
He's.

04:30.090 --> 04:31.340
He's outsourced.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.360
I can give you the contract that I had with that person.

04:33.570 --> 04:38.710
And this is great when you know taxes come around and you need to keep all your documents together.

04:38.940 --> 04:39.940
But I could see right here.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.110
Here's the feedback that he gave me.

04:43.170 --> 04:44.370
I thought I'd given him feedback.

04:44.390 --> 04:50.850
Well and I can go through all of our messages and it kind of this is how much I paid him and you know

04:50.850 --> 04:55.860
this is when I did the contract with them I can send him a message I can throw them a bonus and I can

04:55.860 --> 05:00.640
see now I love this he can actually tell me what time it is where they are.

05:00.900 --> 05:05.600
Somewhere in here it also shows you when the last time he logged in was which is quite helpful too because

05:05.610 --> 05:08.890
a lot of times over times they say oh I haven't seen it.

05:09.030 --> 05:12.720
The message you sent them and you can also check and see that they've already logged on so that's not

05:12.720 --> 05:13.560
true.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.050
So yeah this is oDesk.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.080
It's definitely something you should add to Lance.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.600
Typically like you it's better.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.620
But a lot of people have had a really good experience with that.

05:21.630 --> 05:25.570
ODesk still big wide range of freelancers on here.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.910
I don't think you really go wrong.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.360
Typically though when I look for freelancers I'll post on you Lance and oDesk.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.630
Use them in tandem.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.960
Sense considering they're actually one merged company.

05:35.070 --> 05:39.400
But yeah I think it's something we're checking out some of you like it more than Elance.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.280
So next on our end of year we're going to a freelancer.
