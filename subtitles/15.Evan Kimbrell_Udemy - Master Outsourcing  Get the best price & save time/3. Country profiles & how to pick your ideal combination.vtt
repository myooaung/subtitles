00:10.660 --> 00:15.430
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about what are the popular

00:15.520 --> 00:17.800
areas for outsourcing.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.820
What are their advantages.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.080
What are their disadvantages.

00:20.080 --> 00:27.520
What do you need to know about each area and how do you determine whether or not you should pick one

00:27.520 --> 00:28.750
area versus the other.

00:28.750 --> 00:34.060
So when you go ahead and list your project or start looking for contractors you're probably going to

00:34.060 --> 00:40.540
be amazed at how many different areas and how many different countries are represented in your project

00:40.540 --> 00:41.680
proposals.

00:41.680 --> 00:46.830
So really quite a lot of different hot spots out there for outsourcing.

00:46.970 --> 00:49.840
But you as someone who is trying to get your project done.

00:49.960 --> 00:56.130
How do you kind of tell the difference between an advantage and a disadvantage with regards to an area.

00:56.140 --> 01:00.850
So the big question is does the country that you outsource from does it really matter.

01:01.090 --> 01:04.270
Well and I have to say it's kind of a mixed question.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.720
It's not a clear yes or no.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.760
In some cases absolutely not.

01:08.800 --> 01:14.030
In some cases yes I think there are clear advantages and disadvantages to picking a certain area or

01:14.030 --> 01:15.280
a specific country.

01:15.280 --> 01:22.390
Unfortunately when you ask really anybody else about outsourcing countries and what are their preferred

01:22.390 --> 01:30.220
areas they often will lean on stereotypes and stereotypes are not particularly helpful as they're usually

01:30.220 --> 01:35.500
based off of whatever happened that person's last experience and are not completely representative of

01:35.500 --> 01:41.740
an area as a whole but also based off of just weird cultural kind of misnomers or misunderstandings.

01:41.740 --> 01:48.340
However it is useful to understand that each area has its own interest cities and each area kind of

01:48.340 --> 01:54.700
has their own unique things about them that if people with prior knowledge it can definitely help you

01:54.850 --> 01:56.680
kind of narrow down your list.

01:56.680 --> 02:02.260
So let me give you three criteria that you should actually use when determining whether or not you should

02:02.260 --> 02:03.990
be specific about an area.

02:04.090 --> 02:09.010
Now these are three things that typically a lot of people don't think about but they're really the only

02:09.010 --> 02:11.980
things that are relevant to me in my experience.

02:11.980 --> 02:16.230
When you are trying to narrow down your list and you're trying to think of geography.

02:16.360 --> 02:22.750
So the first thing you should think about is time zones how important is it to you that you're able

02:22.750 --> 02:28.300
to communicate with the company or the freelancer that you're contracting out to.

02:28.300 --> 02:34.060
Does it matter whether or not you can just easily pick up the phone or pick up Skype and immediately

02:34.060 --> 02:35.740
be able to communicate with them.

02:35.740 --> 02:40.010
Does it matter if they are working the same times that you are working.

02:40.030 --> 02:46.420
So there are a lot of different project types that can benefit or find it necessary to work at the same

02:46.420 --> 02:48.640
time as your outsource labor.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.890
If you are running a call center or you needed someone to do customer service for you you probably need

02:53.890 --> 02:57.940
those people to work at the same time that you're getting your customer service requests.

02:57.940 --> 03:02.710
Similarly if you're using a virtual assistant it's often the case that you need to interact with them

03:02.710 --> 03:06.840
frequently and you need them to work while you're working.

03:06.940 --> 03:11.980
Typically when you have a project that requires a lot of back and forth you're going to want to look

03:11.980 --> 03:14.760
at time zones and take that into consideration.

03:14.890 --> 03:19.150
If you have a project also that has a lot of changing requirements.

03:19.150 --> 03:25.120
So let's say you have a project but you're constantly updating what needs to be done where you're constantly

03:25.120 --> 03:28.640
changing the directions from day to day.

03:28.690 --> 03:33.820
That might be the case that you need to be able to communicate with them faster more effectively and

03:33.820 --> 03:38.860
more frequently and thus you might actually care about where the company is located.

03:38.980 --> 03:45.100
So a second thing to take into consideration is does your project have some sort of a cultural component

03:45.310 --> 03:46.520
to it.

03:46.540 --> 03:50.430
Now let me explain what exactly I mean by a cultural component.

03:50.440 --> 03:56.590
Now if you're trying to build a project or let's say a Web site or a mobile application and that relies

03:56.590 --> 04:03.070
on something that is very specific to one culture or one area such that someone outside that area would

04:03.070 --> 04:07.890
have a difficult time understanding that that is something you should take into consideration.

04:07.900 --> 04:11.860
Does your app use a lot of phrases that are very localized.

04:11.860 --> 04:17.050
Does it use a lot of idiomatic phrases that might be confusing for someone who's not familiar with what

04:17.050 --> 04:20.190
you're talking about in those types of cases.

04:20.200 --> 04:27.520
It might be a problem when you explain things to your outsourced team or freelancer because they might

04:27.670 --> 04:31.950
just not understand why you're building it or what exactly it's supposed to do.

04:32.050 --> 04:39.050
Now all outsource freelancers and Laver's firms they're all very good at following directions.

04:39.160 --> 04:44.050
But what we're more concerned with is that they understand the project as a whole and they understand

04:44.050 --> 04:47.930
the bigger questions because that's going to allow them to be more effective in the long term.

04:48.040 --> 04:53.110
And that's going to make it such that they are probably a better partner for a long period of time if

04:53.110 --> 04:58.000
that is the case then obviously you're going to start looking for countries that are a little bit more

04:58.180 --> 05:04.570
say Westernized if you're Western or say if you like live in an Asian country you might want to look

05:04.570 --> 05:11.210
for an outsourced team that can relate specifically to whatever your nation or whatever culture your

05:11.210 --> 05:12.590
application deals with.

05:12.670 --> 05:18.140
So the last criteria that I would introduce is that you think about infrastructure requirements.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.540
Now what exactly do I mean by that.

05:20.600 --> 05:29.870
How important is it that say your freelancer or your outsourced team is available every second of the

05:29.870 --> 05:30.500
day.

05:30.500 --> 05:35.750
So if you have a project that for instance could go off line and that could create a serious problem

05:35.750 --> 05:41.210
for your business then you might want to consider an area that has a better reputation for infrastructure.

05:41.210 --> 05:46.470
And what I mean by infrastructure I mean internet speeds I mean internet availability.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.200
I mean electricity.

05:48.230 --> 05:53.490
I mean really kind of any issue that could get in between them and getting your work done.

05:53.540 --> 06:00.200
This is specific to for instance people who are doing film projects or any project that deals with uploading

06:00.200 --> 06:01.670
lots of information.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.840
So if you're doing a film project you might have to upload gigabytes and gigabytes of film.

06:05.840 --> 06:11.240
So if you use a country that has slow internet speeds that could actually be a deal breaker so you might

06:11.240 --> 06:17.590
want to focus on areas that at least can handle large file uploads and transfers.

06:17.630 --> 06:21.920
So really I mean it can work the same way and say like a web site if you have a Web site that deals

06:21.920 --> 06:24.080
with large file transfers.

06:24.140 --> 06:31.010
We built an application like that before and you know how do we use say like a limited bandwidth connection.

06:31.010 --> 06:34.400
It really would have been possible even to build or test it.

06:34.580 --> 06:40.280
But if you have a looser timeline or what it is that you're outsourcing is not crucial to the everyday

06:40.280 --> 06:45.830
operations of your business or your project then you don't really need to be picky about the infrastructure

06:45.830 --> 06:48.100
requirements of where you source your team.

06:48.110 --> 06:53.940
So keep those three criteria in mind because that's what we use to determine whether or not there's

06:53.960 --> 06:56.000
an advantage or a disadvantage to a certain area.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.970
So with that let's cover some of the bigger more popular areas that you're going to run into.

07:01.970 --> 07:07.370
So right off the bat the biggest one that you're going to notice is South Asia and what I mean by South

07:07.400 --> 07:16.660
Asia is India Bangladesh Sri Lanka Pakistan those four right there are kind of in a lot of cases that

07:16.670 --> 07:21.500
end up being 60 percent of the bids that you get sometimes 70 percent of the bids you will get.

07:21.540 --> 07:31.250
Now those areas are very prolific because outsourcing and BPO business process outsourcing makes up

07:31.250 --> 07:35.840
a very large portion of the economies in those four countries.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.990
There's also a very strong cultural component in that area.

07:38.990 --> 07:45.260
People grow up knowing that jobs is typically associated with outsourcing are usually good jobs and

07:45.260 --> 07:49.170
so there's a much larger group of people that try to move into that space.

07:49.190 --> 07:51.770
The biggest portion of this is really India.

07:51.770 --> 07:56.260
India is probably the prototypical outsourced country.

07:56.330 --> 07:59.900
When you think of outsourcing you probably think of India.

07:59.970 --> 08:02.460
Are the country that gain traction with outsourcing.

08:02.480 --> 08:06.470
Long before other big outsourcing hubs popped up.

08:06.470 --> 08:11.800
So let's try to evaluate South Asia based on those three criteria that I gave you.

08:11.810 --> 08:12.830
So first off.

08:12.830 --> 08:13.620
Time zones.

08:13.640 --> 08:20.330
Well India and Bangladesh and that whole area typically will range at least for the United States anywhere

08:20.360 --> 08:24.100
from 10 hours difference to 12 hours difference.

08:24.110 --> 08:29.810
So that's a pretty significant shift usually if you're using the AM PM clock I like to think of it like

08:29.810 --> 08:30.980
switching it.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.480
You literally just flip the AM of the PM.

08:33.500 --> 08:39.770
So what that means for you is that typically these India as a country or Bangladesh is a country that's

08:39.770 --> 08:44.400
better if you're OK with them working on your project while you're asleep.

08:44.420 --> 08:52.010
It's better if you're more kind of tune towards meeting them when there are morning or night they work

08:52.310 --> 08:55.810
and then you wake up and cap off what they've done for the day.

08:55.820 --> 09:02.340
A lot of firms in India and in this general area they will adjust their schedule to match yours.

09:02.600 --> 09:07.520
But because of the way that the time zone shift works it's it's never a complete match.

09:07.520 --> 09:12.500
Usually just means that the more dedicated firms are freelancers can make sure that you have at least

09:12.500 --> 09:19.640
three or four hours of overlap so you can in most cases get half a day overlap with this area which

09:19.640 --> 09:22.610
you're never going to get for complete coverage.

09:22.610 --> 09:25.340
They're not going to work the same nine to five that you do.

09:25.460 --> 09:32.140
So now culturally This is often debatable but in my head it's very clear as far as westernisation goes.

09:32.150 --> 09:36.460
India is lagging behind the majority of the other outsource hubs.

09:36.530 --> 09:41.610
If you have ever traveled to India it is wildly different than any other western country.

09:41.630 --> 09:48.560
In general it is very hard for an Indian person to understand the same likes and predilections as say

09:48.560 --> 09:52.520
someone living in Western Europe or North America.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.740
So what does that mean.

09:53.750 --> 09:59.030
That means are typically not great if you're trying to pick something again that has a very strong cultural

09:59.030 --> 10:02.910
component to it because that's something that they'll struggle to grasp.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.170
And you're always going to be at a disadvantage with that.

10:05.180 --> 10:12.880
It's also worth noting that if you're an English speaker you are taking this course India speaks a dialect

10:12.970 --> 10:18.430
of English and that's one of the more common misunderstandings about the area.

10:18.460 --> 10:24.100
It's almost better if you're working with a freelancer or an outsourced firm that learned English a

10:24.100 --> 10:25.200
specific way.

10:25.210 --> 10:29.740
India has its own dialect and what that means is that they have their own phrases and they have their

10:29.740 --> 10:35.920
own way of saying things so to native English speaker from another country they can often be very hard

10:35.920 --> 10:37.100
to understand.

10:37.180 --> 10:43.120
A lot of times they'll use phrases or concepts or ways of communicating that are very strange and foreign

10:43.120 --> 10:43.870
to you.

10:43.930 --> 10:48.700
You've probably already noticed at this point if you have a project up and you're taking PIDs that probably

10:48.700 --> 10:51.730
at least one Indian freelancer has called you dear.

10:51.890 --> 10:53.990
You haven't already picked up on that.

10:54.220 --> 11:01.120
They use that as basically a common way of greeting you and Lisa or I'm coming from.

11:01.240 --> 11:06.040
That's a term of intimacy so that always just sounds incredibly strange to them.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.370
That's not strange at all.

11:07.540 --> 11:11.230
Now the last criteria for India and South Asia is infrastructure.

11:11.230 --> 11:17.630
Now infrastructure is one of their weaker points in terms of Internet speed it really just kind of depends.

11:17.650 --> 11:22.970
Their internet speeds in larger hubs like Bangalore or say New Delhi are modest.

11:23.050 --> 11:27.250
They're never going to reach Western standards but it's a modest speed.

11:27.250 --> 11:31.060
So for basic web development mobile application perfectly fine.

11:31.060 --> 11:34.810
Video Production and editing they might struggle outside of the hubs.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.570
Internet quality crashes considerably.

11:37.570 --> 11:42.600
The other part of infrastructure was electricity and that's an issue that they run into constantly.

11:42.610 --> 11:45.880
Even in large areas they will have outages.

11:45.880 --> 11:51.610
Now that's a problem when you have servers when you have storage and you could have issues where you

11:51.610 --> 11:53.430
need On-Call workers.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.990
Now again of course if you don't need any of that you don't need someone who you can snap your fingers

11:58.240 --> 11:59.760
and they show up and fix it.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.650
Then don't worry about picking South Asia.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.610
So keep that in mind when you're thinking about this general geographic area.

12:06.610 --> 12:11.490
So the next one worth discussing is Eastern Europe Eastern Europe is probably the number two.

12:11.490 --> 12:17.830
I would say it's probably the second most represented in the bid list that you're going to get for your

12:17.830 --> 12:18.660
project.

12:18.670 --> 12:23.310
Eastern Europe could honestly mean a whole range of countries.

12:23.440 --> 12:32.050
You know Ukraine and Poland and Belarus and even like Hungary and Croatia those are very common countries

12:32.050 --> 12:33.300
that get bids from.

12:33.340 --> 12:38.020
Those are countries that have very strong developer cultures.

12:38.020 --> 12:44.230
There's a very large portion of the country that is interested in computer science or tries to get jobs

12:44.260 --> 12:45.680
in computer science.

12:45.700 --> 12:51.700
Now in general if I had to pick between two bids that are the exact same one was in Eastern Europe one

12:51.700 --> 12:52.290
was in India.

12:52.300 --> 12:57.460
Typically pick Eastern Europe that's simply because of the three criteria we discussed before they actually

12:57.460 --> 12:58.720
score quite a bit better.

12:58.720 --> 13:04.420
So in time zones they're a little bit better if you're in Europe then they don't have a terrible time

13:04.420 --> 13:06.540
zone switch in a couple of hours ahead.

13:06.550 --> 13:10.260
The United States it's less than India and India is typically 12.

13:10.260 --> 13:13.370
For us there are usually more around eight or nine.

13:13.390 --> 13:16.200
Culturally it could really range.

13:16.200 --> 13:22.420
I mean a lot of Soviet bloc countries have a lot of differences with westernized countries.

13:22.420 --> 13:27.800
But as a whole they're much much more westernized than say South Asia.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.960
So that makes it a lot easier for them to understand.

13:30.950 --> 13:34.710
They're probably more familiar with things that you're familiar with.

13:34.840 --> 13:41.800
They'll probably catch on more references that you make to say popular applications or popular businesses

13:41.890 --> 13:43.330
in the country that you're from.

13:43.630 --> 13:48.700
And then last thing infrastructure infrastructure is again considerably better.

13:48.700 --> 13:54.650
There are several countries that have higher internet speeds than say even the United States.

13:54.670 --> 14:00.400
Romania is actually a great example of a country that's average internet speed is almost up there with

14:00.400 --> 14:02.730
like even South Korea and Japan.

14:02.740 --> 14:08.890
So if you're trying to do large file transfers if you're worried about whatever it is that your outsourcing

14:08.890 --> 14:13.390
needs high connection speeds usually that's not a problem.

14:13.390 --> 14:18.340
It's a terrible way of generalizing but in general if I were to average out all the countries that all

14:18.550 --> 14:24.250
kind of come together to build your build your bed base they do have faster internet.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.880
So those are the two biggest hubs.

14:26.890 --> 14:32.170
And honestly if you stay within those two regions you'll do perfectly fine.

14:32.320 --> 14:37.840
I'm going to discuss two other areas briefly and I'm just going to highlight what exactly are the differences

14:37.840 --> 14:40.440
about those and why you would consider them.

14:40.450 --> 14:46.690
So one of them is Southeast Asia in-general Southeast Asia is not a big hub for outsourcing.

14:46.690 --> 14:54.340
Thailand and Indonesia don't really make up a big portion of outsourced projects or even outsourced

14:54.340 --> 14:55.390
firms.

14:55.390 --> 15:02.050
The Philippines in general have a much stronger call center culture and in general have better English

15:02.050 --> 15:03.730
speaking skills.

15:03.730 --> 15:08.650
Anecdotally it's actually interesting how many American countries actually outsource their call centers

15:08.650 --> 15:09.550
to the Philippines.

15:09.850 --> 15:16.300
It specifically because so many people in the Philippines get English training and cultural training

15:16.630 --> 15:21.400
so that they can actually be passed off as American call center agents.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.040
So keep that in mind if you have a project that's very sensitive towards accents.

15:26.050 --> 15:31.990
If it's something where you need your outsourced freelancer or firm to speak on the phone or make recorded

15:31.990 --> 15:35.320
messages then the Philippines are an area to consider.

15:35.320 --> 15:39.730
The other thing that's very interesting is because of the call center culture a lot of people have what

15:39.730 --> 15:46.690
we call reverse schedules or reverse schedule meaning that they actually sleep when North America Sleeps

15:46.720 --> 15:48.770
and they're awake when North America is awake.

15:48.910 --> 15:57.190
They also do similar schedules switches for Europe as well so if you have something like a virtual assistant

15:57.670 --> 16:02.510
task that could be the spot that's probably the most ideal.

16:02.530 --> 16:08.290
So data entry tasks virtual assistance Philippines can be a great spot for that.

16:08.450 --> 16:13.480
Developers on the other hand it's less developed and you're going to have to judge that pretty much

16:13.480 --> 16:14.850
on a case by case basis.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.500
Now the last area I'm going discuss is Central and South America.

16:18.520 --> 16:24.190
Now I'm only highlighting Central and South America because their time zones match almost perfectly

16:24.520 --> 16:27.200
with the United States and Canada.

16:27.220 --> 16:33.760
So if you have a project that it is crucial that you have matching time zones it's crucial that you

16:33.760 --> 16:38.870
know at a second's notice you can communicate with your freelancer or with your outsourced firm didn't

16:38.890 --> 16:41.080
consider Central and South America.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.890
They are not areas that are specifically well-known for anything else.

16:44.890 --> 16:46.950
They don't have strong developer culture.

16:46.960 --> 16:52.870
They don't have strong business process outsourced cultures.

16:52.930 --> 17:00.460
But specifically if time zone is the most important thing to you then look for countries like Argentina

17:00.520 --> 17:04.140
Costa Rica anywhere that's kind of in that area.

17:04.150 --> 17:10.870
So in general guys you really want to judge your bid or your proposal based off the merit itself.

17:10.870 --> 17:17.680
If you have specific requirements on your project like say you need fast internet speed or say you need

17:17.680 --> 17:24.280
some type of cultural fluency or you need a reduced accent because you need a freelancer who can speak

17:24.280 --> 17:25.910
on the fly.

17:25.990 --> 17:29.410
These are things to take into consideration and apply those too.

17:29.410 --> 17:36.160
Now what you now know about some of the hot spots around the world for outsourcing in general.

17:36.190 --> 17:39.830
Personally when I if I had to pick I usually use Eastern Europe.

17:40.030 --> 17:41.920
India is great for certain things.

17:41.920 --> 17:47.140
Central America South America are fantastic for time zones if you're in North America and obviously

17:47.140 --> 17:52.690
the Philippines is great if you're trying to do data entry virtual assistants or anything that involves

17:52.690 --> 17:53.550
the telephone.

17:53.680 --> 17:59.290
OK guys if you have any questions I know a lot of these things are generalizations so don't you know

17:59.290 --> 18:04.900
be up in arms about anything I've said but I'm trying to make kind of boil this down and then distill

18:04.900 --> 18:06.740
this so that it's helpful to you.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.930
That's why I use those three criteria because those are the only real three things that you should take

18:10.930 --> 18:12.090
into consideration.

18:12.100 --> 18:16.980
There are obvious exceptions in every single area but I'm trying to give you a bit of a shortcut.

18:17.020 --> 18:21.700
When you go and have to actually pick someone you're just kind of confused about what does it matter

18:21.700 --> 18:22.750
what country they're from.

18:22.750 --> 18:30.590
So I'll see in the next lecture.
