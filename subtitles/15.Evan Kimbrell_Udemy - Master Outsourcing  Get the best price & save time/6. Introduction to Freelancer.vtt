WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:01.350
All right.

00:01.350 --> 00:03.370
Welcome back.

00:03.370 --> 00:06.130
We're going to go over freelancer dot com.

00:06.180 --> 00:09.160
I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible.

00:09.160 --> 00:17.220
I had mentioned before that freelancer is the least like the other two freelancer has the most the largest

00:17.220 --> 00:21.350
user base of freelancers of about seven million there also.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.460
Strangely enough the least profitable of the three.

00:26.610 --> 00:34.860
Mainly because they make most of their money off of project upgrades and all of an assortment of fees

00:34.860 --> 00:37.170
that they've kind of come up with.

00:37.230 --> 00:42.840
So we're just going to go to this pretty quickly as you can see it is just kind of a mess in terms of

00:42.840 --> 00:48.980
a user interface during this demo if something breaks or something doesn't load.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.390
I'm not entirely surprised.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.850
Pre-cancer is the place that I call it the Wild West.

00:56.040 --> 01:01.730
A great metaphor or A B comparison is it's kind of the Craigslist of freelancing services.

01:01.780 --> 01:03.680
There's not a lot of rules.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.210
Pretty much anything goes.

01:06.390 --> 01:12.930
And a lot of times you find some things that are really kind of what you'd call like black hat or very

01:12.930 --> 01:14.670
kind of scatch.

01:15.480 --> 01:22.650
So anyway speaking of scatch I use this as a burn away account and I just have a fake name associated

01:22.650 --> 01:28.560
with it but I'm either using freelancer for quite a long time mainly because they're the best if you

01:28.560 --> 01:36.470
have a small task or you have something that's not you know it's harder to get done.

01:36.780 --> 01:43.500
A lot of times like I might be thinking I'm I mean a an artist an illustrator I need someone who specializes

01:43.500 --> 01:48.900
in video or audio or something that not I don't think necessarily lends itself well the answer I would

01:48.900 --> 01:49.400
ask.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.280
I go to a freelancer freelancer has people that do pretty much everything and as you can see over here

01:54.290 --> 02:00.380
here some progress I've actually been using freelancer to help out with my you Dimi courses.

02:00.960 --> 02:07.620
So you'll notice here it kind of looks like the other two you poster project here you find your freelancers

02:07.620 --> 02:12.890
here you can browse other projects they give you a lot more controls over it.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.970
You can look for all of the projects that are like ending soon ones that have no bids.

02:19.410 --> 02:25.950
Ones that fit your skills if you're a freelancer post contests not to be confused with post project

02:26.580 --> 02:32.970
freelancer also has a secondary function which is that they have a contest section of their web site.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.400
If you click on this button right here you can see the other services they offer.

02:37.620 --> 02:44.370
So freelancer's the main one freelancer contest is their answer to 99 designs freelancers services.

02:44.370 --> 02:47.780
Is there a copy cat a fiver or a dot com.

02:47.820 --> 02:52.810
I don't even know what these three are but chances are you probably will use them.

02:53.070 --> 02:58.860
Freelancer is a little bit weird or you will upload money into your account and so like you'll deposit

02:58.860 --> 03:03.410
funds and then you'll pay your freelancers freelancer.

03:03.550 --> 03:08.580
Keep in mind that there's not a lot of support when it comes to people who disappear or don't do your

03:08.580 --> 03:10.360
work don't do it correctly.

03:10.410 --> 03:17.270
They have tried to automate virtually everything and to the detriment of their community.

03:17.640 --> 03:23.630
So we can check out what a project looks like.

03:23.810 --> 03:25.180
Here is an example.

03:25.410 --> 03:31.140
Earlier in the course you've seen some hand drawings I actually use this as a way of drumming up leads

03:31.140 --> 03:35.250
for looking for a graphic designer who could help me.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.310
What they will do is

03:42.090 --> 03:48.980
what they do is they will show off at the very top of each project who they suggest.

03:49.020 --> 03:55.920
Now this is something you won't notice with Lance Lance doesn't usually suggest a user oDesk won't suggest

03:55.950 --> 04:03.600
a user freelancer well and also a lot of times you'll notice that they have sponsored listings meaning

04:03.600 --> 04:06.480
someone can pay to show up at the top of your list.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.730
They also do this weird thing which is on purpose.

04:08.730 --> 04:12.150
I can't hide bids.

04:12.390 --> 04:19.280
Wow you can't even talking about freelancer and how much their user interface is kind of crap design.

04:19.290 --> 04:21.530
You notice that constantly things are just cut off.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.240
But what this.

04:23.430 --> 04:28.920
I think it says report meaning I can report it if it's spam but I can never seem to get rid of any bid

04:29.460 --> 04:30.760
anyway.

04:31.350 --> 04:34.700
Yes that is how they design the layouts.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.980
Keep in mind people can sponsor their bids can show up at the top.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.000
I try to stay away from sponsored bids.

04:40.170 --> 04:44.460
A lot of freelancers who sponsored bids at the beginning so that they can reach so they can get a lot

04:44.460 --> 04:46.490
of projects at first.

04:46.530 --> 04:54.960
They have built in a chat system so this is along with a frequently used contact list.

04:55.080 --> 05:01.140
So in NLC you little notice if someone is online you can see that they will pop up and will have a green

05:01.140 --> 05:02.400
dot.

05:02.730 --> 05:09.060
So they've integrated instant messaging into their system and then they've integrated all sorts of other

05:09.060 --> 05:12.900
web sites into a kind of a hodgepodge it's really kind of a melting pot.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.640
That's why I call it the Wild West.

05:15.690 --> 05:21.540
You can get of the greatest value possible out of here and at the same time you can get some of the

05:21.540 --> 05:24.930
largest headaches dot com.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.540
It's typically a great option.

05:27.630 --> 05:33.600
For instance if you want to get a clone of a Web site it's also great if you want someone to do some

05:33.600 --> 05:35.180
advertising for you.

05:35.180 --> 05:38.660
So actually if you want to bend the rules a little bit and you're fine.

05:38.670 --> 05:42.190
Kind of walking the line between spam and not spam.

05:42.240 --> 05:48.410
This is kind of a place that you would look for people let's see freelance.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.710
I'm also a strange thing that they do is.

05:51.950 --> 06:00.180
Man if I can even find it they have tried to Gamefly their system quite a bit.

06:00.630 --> 06:03.710
Where is it where.

06:03.790 --> 06:04.510
OK here it is.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.170
Myra Woodwards I thought this was goofy.

06:07.170 --> 06:13.120
If you are someone that does a lot of projects a lot of the time they have made a whole badge system

06:13.120 --> 06:17.100
and a credit Shaha Peden and all sorts of goofy things.

06:17.190 --> 06:26.160
You know I'm level 12 journeyman and so I could use this to upgrade and to get free featuring and free.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.890
I'm not even entirely sure.

06:28.230 --> 06:31.320
But anyway it's kind of like a rewards program.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.570
You know maybe some of you might find some use out of this.

06:33.570 --> 06:36.300
Maybe you won't see.

06:36.500 --> 06:36.810
All right.

06:36.810 --> 06:40.290
So anyway I promised that I'd keep this one short.

06:40.290 --> 06:43.770
We're not going to do a deep dive into this Web site there.

06:43.890 --> 06:49.110
Honestly there are enough features on this website to make an entire course out of it seems like.

06:49.110 --> 06:55.680
And for your purposes you really just want to focus with the basics which is posting a project and then

06:55.710 --> 07:02.660
managing your freelancers and also just knowing kind of ahead of time what exactly are the best interests

07:02.730 --> 07:05.870
about this Web site here.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.780
I mean this is the Czar you'd post the project.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.140
It's virtually the same.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.750
This is one thing that is worth posting talking about very briefly.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.980
They make most of their money off of upgrades.

07:18.180 --> 07:25.260
So if you want to for instance increase the reach of your page you can do a free trade listing cost

07:25.260 --> 07:26.900
$29 if you want to do.

07:26.910 --> 07:30.640
Urgent urgent means that you just put some marker next or that says urgent.

07:30.780 --> 07:35.340
And then more people know that you're trying to pick someone soon and so you get a lot of bids.

07:35.560 --> 07:40.350
Recruiters the service they offer that I don't believe the other to offer you pay $29 and they will

07:40.350 --> 07:43.080
help you recruit someone.

07:43.170 --> 07:49.470
In my experience it's not particularly helpful because the support they give you is very minimal.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.490
But I believe what ends up happening when you're a recruiter is you get an automatic upgrade to being

07:53.490 --> 07:58.090
featured and that's kind of how they justify paying for the service.

07:58.250 --> 08:02.760
One of the goofy things that it'll happen is when you post your project it will ask you if you want

08:02.760 --> 08:04.550
to upgrade and you can do that.

08:04.570 --> 08:08.190
And if you don't upgrade it says you want to do a free version and it says the free version you have

08:08.190 --> 08:12.530
to wait and someone has to manually review your posting.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.410
That is not true.

08:14.430 --> 08:21.000
So if you hit the free version it loads it pretends that it's getting reviewed and then it just posted.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.370
It's actually computer them that checks it over.

08:23.500 --> 08:29.800
There's actually no delay so don't get tricked into paying extra money if you don't feel like it.

08:30.070 --> 08:34.660
Freelancer it's another Web site that I think you should add to your toolkit.

08:35.080 --> 08:40.060
If you have I think it's better for auxiliary services and I think that it's great for finding people

08:40.060 --> 08:44.140
that are kind of your odds and ends things people can fill in the gaps and.
