WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:12.360
OK so applying this now to a job listing and you guys can literally just type it in like I did.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.550
And so I think it's always a good idea to literally just put it in like that because then what I can

00:17.550 --> 00:21.810
do is if I if I forget what I'm supposed to be writing I can just go oh hey look.

00:21.810 --> 00:26.500
Next section is called Why next section is called How next section is called specifics.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.680
In the next section is called perks and you can literally just write underneath these letters.

00:30.750 --> 00:35.250
I would remove the headers because it looks ridiculous but this is a good rough guide especially for

00:35.250 --> 00:37.540
you out there who have never done this before.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.920
This is a template that works very very effectively.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.640
I wish more people did it because they'd get a lot more bids and they get better people.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.380
But if you follow this this is how we honestly.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.940
Every time we post the job we get anywhere from like 30 to 60 people where other people get five to

00:53.940 --> 00:54.630
10.

00:54.870 --> 00:55.120
OK.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.260
So let's just kind of role play a little bit.

00:57.270 --> 01:01.530
Let's imagine you are building that dating iOS app that's native.

01:01.530 --> 01:05.200
What would we say in the what we would say.

01:05.350 --> 01:09.120
And honestly don't worry about we versus I versus us.

01:09.120 --> 01:09.990
It doesn't really matter.

01:09.990 --> 01:12.490
So I'm just going to make this up as they go.

01:13.490 --> 01:13.780
OK.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.880
So here is a good one description.

01:16.940 --> 01:22.590
We don't need to give them too much detail just again a fly over a description of what it is.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.400
I'm just making this up on the fly.

01:24.830 --> 01:28.550
We are looking to build an iOS app for dating in the United States.

01:28.550 --> 01:32.210
The app will be tailored for the 30 to 40 year old group range.

01:32.210 --> 01:34.380
I just put that for you know.

01:34.430 --> 01:38.520
Giggles I don't think that 30 to 40 year old groups are going to be using Iowa.

01:38.570 --> 01:42.990
So this probably isn't going to be a great project but I do want to say 20 to 30 year olds because and

01:43.010 --> 01:46.690
I'm just quite literally imitating other applications.

01:46.700 --> 01:51.640
The app will operate in many ways like a cross between tender and those who do not know what that is

01:51.650 --> 01:57.500
I put a link and Coffee Meets Bagel again put a link that's always helpful if someone knows what it

01:57.500 --> 02:00.830
is great if they don't put the link so they can go and look for it.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.430
The more time they spend researching this and looking into it the better.

02:04.430 --> 02:09.680
It also gives the contractors an opportunity to say hey I looked at this Web site and then you know

02:09.680 --> 02:12.420
hey there they're actually interested in doing some outside research.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.740
They're taking a little more initiative.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.900
And they said all the matching and messaging investment we've done from the phone and automatically

02:17.900 --> 02:21.120
connects you to location based singles in your area.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.920
All very very very generic.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.040
When you build your own app whatever anything you're getting done you obviously will give a little bit

02:31.040 --> 02:35.420
more detail it wouldn't be nearly as generic as this but that is sufficient for the what.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.890
So now will move on to the why now I'm going to keep this very simple.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.690
I'm only going to limit this to maybe one or two sentences.

02:41.990 --> 02:46.510
So I put down two sentences for the Y and do a little bit more you can do a little bit less.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.890
Just don't go crazy with it.

02:47.980 --> 02:49.520
I just I'm just making this up.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.690
This absolutely makes no sense but we've noticed that there are limited options for dating when you're

02:53.690 --> 02:59.120
between 30 to 40 the age range is increase this age range is increasingly using smartphones that have

02:59.120 --> 03:01.930
been using tender feeling out of place as they should.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.080
Tender is kind of like an orgy on your phone.

03:06.080 --> 03:12.440
So that's the reason why I put this is because again we want people to feel some kind of a connection

03:12.440 --> 03:12.970
to it.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.790
They need to understand that there's a pain point we're addressing.

03:15.860 --> 03:19.600
Typically if you don't add the y it's hard to connect to the project.

03:20.060 --> 03:24.980
I put you know there's limited options for dating when you're between 30 and 40.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.230
Hopefully what I'm looking for is someone who might be in the 30 to 40 range and has connected with

03:30.230 --> 03:31.430
this problem before.

03:31.430 --> 03:35.540
So one of the best things you can do is have someone who's actually trying to build something they would

03:35.540 --> 03:40.040
use that's going to make them much more interested in it's going to be easier to get them to do over

03:40.040 --> 03:41.120
time.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.690
It's just a much much more fluid relationship.

03:44.690 --> 03:49.280
And in the rest of it I just kind of gave some market justification saying there are a lot of them using

03:49.280 --> 03:53.840
smartphones but they can't use these other things that are cater to the twentieth 30 year olds whatever.

03:54.490 --> 03:54.810
OK.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.510
So now the how.

03:56.530 --> 04:00.130
Now remember the how is not very specific.

04:00.130 --> 04:03.520
We're going to deal with actual documentation later.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.410
We have an entire section on it.

04:05.470 --> 04:10.280
The how is really I'm just going to give a basic kind of description.

04:10.410 --> 04:14.290
So as they're eating it they can understand what's involved.

04:14.350 --> 04:15.880
What does a user see.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.830
They can start to mentally prepare for how big this project is.

04:20.050 --> 04:20.830
Now what the how.

04:20.830 --> 04:25.900
Honestly I would just describe everything you can't get but don't go crazy you don't need to explain

04:25.900 --> 04:27.310
the color of the buttons.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.530
You just need to explain these are the main functions.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.390
These are the main points of the application.

04:32.710 --> 04:33.320
OK.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.930
And so I just kind of threw this down.

04:34.930 --> 04:42.630
It's kind of like a fat paragraph which is roughly what I think you should shoot for what I said here

04:42.630 --> 04:51.090
is I am imagining that I'm picking up the app and I'm downloading it logging in and using the primary

04:51.090 --> 04:52.300
functions of the app.

04:52.380 --> 04:58.560
So I'm just describing verbally what happens now if you're building a small application this is easy

04:58.560 --> 05:02.550
to do if you're building a large one then you might want to paint with broader strokes and you might

05:02.550 --> 05:05.030
want to describe more things at once.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.800
So what I said was users log into a splash page and see an option for Facebook log and splash page for

05:10.800 --> 05:13.720
those of you who don't know what that word phrase means.

05:13.930 --> 05:18.420
That's when you open up your application and the first screen that you get kind of introduced to the

05:18.420 --> 05:22.200
app that's the splash page it's technically what you land on.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.480
You can also call it a landing page.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.000
I've heard other terms for it as well but that's where it just pops up and says name of application.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.460
Sign up or read our terms and agreements.

05:33.540 --> 05:36.360
So they're going to see an option for Facebook logon.

05:36.420 --> 05:40.500
Now then I specified no other log in options at this time.

05:40.500 --> 05:45.020
That's important because you know if you have multiple ways of logging in say you can log in with linked

05:45.020 --> 05:50.400
and Facebook and e-mail that is significantly more complicated than just logging in with Facebook.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.830
That's a lot more work for the developer.

05:53.180 --> 05:58.050
And so I don't want them to think that there are multiple ways of logging in.

05:58.050 --> 06:01.990
I like to be specific in that sense I like to show them that this is simple.

06:02.190 --> 06:06.810
So after logging in the answer questionnaire that has 25 questions and it's three pages long all questions

06:06.810 --> 06:09.750
are 9:59 radio buttons.

06:10.110 --> 06:15.390
So now here is what I'm kind of envisioning is that you see a page and it asks you questions you know

06:15.390 --> 06:17.880
do you hate cats do you love dogs.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.130
How much alone time do you need.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.000
How desperate are you.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.330
Things like that.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.730
And they answer all of those.

06:24.870 --> 06:28.400
And then what I explain as I say these are one to 10 radio buttons.

06:28.410 --> 06:34.170
Now again radio button is those buttons where say you have multiple options and you can only select

06:34.170 --> 06:35.090
one.

06:35.150 --> 06:36.320
It's not a dropdown.

06:36.320 --> 06:41.110
So when you click those buttons that have there are just tiny circular buttons that you select.

06:41.190 --> 06:45.720
So it would have a 1 through 10 and they'd have to answer based on that rating scale.

06:45.720 --> 06:50.550
Now the reasons why I said All questions are like this is because that again reduces the complexity

06:50.550 --> 06:56.610
of the application saving that into a database is very simple versus say if I said you know there's

06:56.940 --> 07:04.170
four or five different question types we have long form we have short answer dropdown boxes combo boxes

07:04.200 --> 07:05.760
and radio buttons.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.120
So I simplified it.

07:07.230 --> 07:11.520
And I always suggest people start with the simplest version of re-application as possible but of course

07:11.520 --> 07:12.550
it's up to you.

07:13.140 --> 07:18.450
If I had multiple ways of answering questions I would have explained that as well after they answer

07:18.450 --> 07:22.350
these questions they're invited to write a short one to two sentence description of themselves and finish

07:22.350 --> 07:23.280
their profile.

07:23.280 --> 07:30.090
Now there's a lot more detail I could put into that I can say how many characters it is I could say

07:30.090 --> 07:36.180
whether or not there's key words I could say with the prompt is I could say what exactly they do to

07:36.180 --> 07:40.580
finish the profile but this is honestly the description of the process.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.760
So we don't need to get that specific.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.870
That's in the documentation section.

07:44.910 --> 07:48.150
After this they will be presented with a homescreen with two options.

07:48.150 --> 07:54.180
So I'm just explaining to them the process flow 1 C or matches for the day two to four matches per day

07:54.540 --> 07:59.940
and to change your profile information and upload photographs so that is the way I see this it's just

07:59.940 --> 08:01.100
very very basic.

08:01.110 --> 08:08.460
You you click one button and it shows you matches and you click another button and you can change your

08:08.460 --> 08:09.270
information.

08:09.270 --> 08:12.870
Now I did not elaborate what happens after you see your matches.

08:12.870 --> 08:16.000
That's something that probably I should elaborate on.

08:16.060 --> 08:20.580
And if you're building something like that make sure that you don't leave out that chunk of information.

08:20.580 --> 08:24.930
But at this point they probably know that that section is missing so they're going to go to your documentation

08:24.930 --> 08:27.100
section and read more about it.

08:27.180 --> 08:32.480
The matching system is simple and based off a 100 point system which is elaborated on the attached documentation.

08:32.490 --> 08:37.620
Now whenever you put something that's like a matching system or you click a button and the system finds

08:37.620 --> 08:39.710
you this you need to elaborate.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.100
How that's done.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.280
You don't need to say in the description.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.560
Here is my algorithm for how it matches people.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.590
All I can say is it's a simple system.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.850
You want it you know and it's a point system.

08:50.850 --> 08:53.480
That's a very easy way of describing it to them.

08:53.580 --> 08:58.980
If you didn't describe how the algorithm works there's going to be a big question mark in the person's

08:58.980 --> 09:00.920
head thing themselves.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.010
How big is this.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.450
How complicated is this.

09:03.450 --> 09:05.300
How often does the algorithm have to update.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.960
Does the algorithm have to update itself etc. etc..

09:08.030 --> 09:09.880
And I'm saying no it's very simple.

09:10.200 --> 09:10.520
OK.

09:10.530 --> 09:16.200
Moving on to specs now in specs we're just going to focus on the specific requirements of the application.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.400
Here's where the odds and ends with these that you would put But these are the things that are very

09:20.400 --> 09:22.090
very specific to the application.

09:22.110 --> 09:23.280
It won't work without it.

09:23.450 --> 09:23.770
OK.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.180
And so I kind of just threw this out.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.210
This is all just theoretical.

09:27.210 --> 09:31.380
These are all just made up information that apps should be a native application.

09:31.380 --> 09:35.790
Explain this in a previous lecture native application means native application means that it's an app

09:35.790 --> 09:42.210
on your iPhone you click it opens up a screen that is made for that app it's not opening up a screen

09:42.210 --> 09:47.850
that leads you to actually their Web site and the web site does not look like the mobile application

09:47.860 --> 09:51.550
this is built entirely separate from the Web site.

09:51.570 --> 09:53.700
So that's what I said that's something specific.

09:53.700 --> 09:58.740
Now if someone if I didn't put that they'd think who can be a hybrid app like oh is it just a Web site

09:58.770 --> 10:00.040
that's mobile friendly.

10:00.060 --> 10:00.380
No.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.560
It's a native application.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.730
I said I want to integrate as a mess tools into the application so must be familiar with Tullio or some

10:05.730 --> 10:11.160
similar service that you're not familiar with Twilio Toyo is a service that allows you to send text

10:11.160 --> 10:15.400
messages and have robots make phone calls and such and such.

10:15.510 --> 10:20.730
They're very easy to use and they're very helpful and they make it such that building S-M functionality

10:20.730 --> 10:22.460
and your application is very easy.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.540
But this is just theoretical right.

10:24.540 --> 10:29.280
Like I could've just said I want to integrate SML tools into this application so you must be familiar

10:29.280 --> 10:31.190
with knowing how to do that.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.360
You don't need to be specific you just tell them what the end product you want is you don't need to

10:36.360 --> 10:37.290
know all of this.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.240
You also don't need to know all this jargon.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.880
You just need to be able to convey to the person this is what you want.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.270
And then I said this is always something you should always address.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.980
I said I will provide designs.

10:46.990 --> 10:48.900
You have to slice and place the images.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.470
Again you don't have to be this specific.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.360
I do this because I run a web studio so I know these things.

10:54.360 --> 10:58.920
But you could say I will provide the designs and that's it.

10:58.920 --> 11:04.010
And they'll be able to figure it out from there that you're going to send them designs.

11:04.110 --> 11:07.740
It's helpful to tell them what format you're going to send them to the designs and but this is helpful

11:07.740 --> 11:11.720
because what this means is when I say provide designs it means I have the designs done.

11:11.730 --> 11:17.620
I'll give them to you but I don't have someone who has taken the image and cut them up for use.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.680
No one's taken it and created buttons out of this design.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.070
I just have one big photoshop file.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.850
Again you don't need to know that.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.950
You can just say it as plain as possible.

11:29.010 --> 11:31.090
They'll understand you just want to get that across.

11:31.110 --> 11:31.670
OK.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.410
Last thing perks perks I'm just going to elaborate on what I put up at the top.

11:36.420 --> 11:36.740
All right.

11:36.750 --> 11:41.330
So here I just literally went oh down the line and elaborated.

11:41.490 --> 11:42.900
So repeat work.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.510
Now generally what that means is.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.590
So what I said if this is built well I've many more features that I would want to add to it.

11:49.590 --> 11:54.150
I also have another mobile application idea I'd love to start a long term developer relationship.

11:54.150 --> 11:56.490
This could mean a lot of different things that you work for a company.

11:56.490 --> 12:01.880
You could say we have other projects and we're looking for developers that we can trust.

12:02.100 --> 12:06.670
You could say Yeah I mean if the if the application is successful will expand it.

12:06.870 --> 12:12.180
You can say that we have other projects that we're posting right now that will shortlist you for things

12:12.180 --> 12:12.560
like that.

12:12.570 --> 12:18.050
Those are very very attractive to developers or contractors.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.220
And then I said I will pay hourly and I like to start as soon as possible.

12:22.270 --> 12:28.020
Now hourly if you want to get technical what you can call that is time and materials time and materials

12:28.020 --> 12:32.250
means that I'm willing to explain this very quickly because later we have a full lecture on this because

12:32.250 --> 12:38.550
it's a very important thing time and materials means that whatever they build you're going to pay them

12:38.550 --> 12:42.240
for how long it takes them and not what they built.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.650
So if it takes them five times as long to build it as they originally thought it doesn't matter you're

12:46.650 --> 12:48.180
paying them for how long it took.

12:48.180 --> 12:52.090
Same thing goes that if it takes them half as much time they're getting paid for that much.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.330
People contractors like that.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.650
That's what they generally like.

12:55.650 --> 13:02.130
They don't like to only get paid when something works well or comes out correctly because a lot of times

13:02.130 --> 13:07.140
it's not entirely their fault if it's delivered late or if something doesn't work.

13:07.170 --> 13:11.820
So they know that regardless of what happens they're going to get paid for their time which is what

13:11.820 --> 13:13.260
they want to get paid for.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.950
The other thing I just said is I'd like to start as soon as possible.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.190
This is a larger application so I would not suggest ever doing that.

13:20.430 --> 13:24.220
But since you put at the top I just show you how to handle it.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.530
I just put See please message me with your availability Now that's important because if you're trying

13:28.530 --> 13:31.910
to start right now you want someone who's immediately responsive.

13:32.070 --> 13:35.190
I don't want someone who's going to bid and then check in two days later I want someone who's going

13:35.190 --> 13:37.580
to bid and say hey I can start now.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.540
That's obviously important.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.690
At the very end what you would do is you'd put some kind of directives.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.780
I'm not going to cover that right now because later we're going to talk about that in depth because

13:45.780 --> 13:48.110
that deserves an entirely new lecture.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.500
Directors are very helpful.

13:49.500 --> 13:53.250
This is an example of a directive so message me with your availability.

13:53.250 --> 13:57.210
What that basically means is that if if someone responds and they don't tell you your availability they

13:57.210 --> 13:59.240
did not read the entire description.

13:59.340 --> 14:04.230
Probably not a detail oriented person probably a little too busy so that's a negative score against

14:04.230 --> 14:07.420
them helps you kind of predetermine who you want to work with.

14:07.440 --> 14:15.670
OK so this was a sample run later in the course I'm going to run through another example of making a

14:15.840 --> 14:17.080
job description.

14:17.130 --> 14:20.570
If you think you've gotten it you can skip over it.

14:20.580 --> 14:25.350
I think it's just helpful to watch me just go through and post because honestly I've posted probably

14:26.550 --> 14:36.810
probably 300 job or application or contractor postings over the last four to five years so I know kind

14:36.810 --> 14:41.380
of how X I know what works for us and I know generally what are the best practices.

14:41.460 --> 14:46.500
If you want some more practice with it there is another lecture coming up but otherwise I will see you

14:46.500 --> 14:52.620
guys in the next lecture where we cover the rest of the posting where we cover things like down here.

14:52.620 --> 14:57.960
What are the thought processes behind the category of work specific skills are really arrangements things

14:57.960 --> 15:08.050
like that so see in the next lecture.
