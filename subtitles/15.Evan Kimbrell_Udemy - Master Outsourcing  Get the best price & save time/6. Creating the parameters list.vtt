WEBVTT

00:05.930 --> 00:06.590
OK.

00:06.620 --> 00:12.510
And so the section 4 parameters no parameters it just kind of explained.

00:12.840 --> 00:19.410
It's really where you're going to put any type of specifics that you don't want your developer to make

00:19.410 --> 00:20.800
assumptions about.

00:20.820 --> 00:28.260
This is where I would say I would explain kind of the nitty gritty of how some specific parts of what

00:28.260 --> 00:31.470
I'm writing about work now.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.050
So I've written some questions to help you kind of clarify what exactly this means.

00:36.300 --> 00:41.400
And these are the most common things that you would put in parameters.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.570
Again this is an optional category.

00:43.620 --> 00:49.740
If you have something that is very straightforward it's not very confusing to anyone reading it and

00:49.740 --> 00:54.540
you have very good documentation as to you know when I say this function it's like this.

00:54.540 --> 00:59.090
And you can link to it then you very very may well skip over parameters.

00:59.100 --> 01:05.760
But most of you have a couple things that you probably want to specify and in this section it covers

01:05.880 --> 01:10.170
you know quite a lot of common things you see in Web sites and mobile.

01:10.200 --> 01:18.490
OK so an example would be does your application or your web site have any algorithms so algorithms.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.910
What do I mean by that.

01:19.920 --> 01:27.930
Now anytime you say the word search or say match that implies that you have an algorithm in this application

01:27.930 --> 01:31.480
this lovely app we're matching people up remember.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.200
So how does it match them up.

01:34.200 --> 01:40.170
Well uses a questionnaire but how does the questionnaire or how does the system use that questionnaire

01:40.170 --> 01:41.480
to match them.

01:41.490 --> 01:46.550
Now what does it do does it just look for like a one to one basis does it look for exact matches.

01:46.550 --> 01:51.360
Does it look for 50 percent match does it look for people that are opposites.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.800
These are things that you need to specify and you don't need to build out the algorithm right here.

01:55.800 --> 02:01.470
You don't need to say here's the programming system here's exactly how it's going to work here's the

02:01.950 --> 02:04.200
you know the line of code that calculates all of it.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.810
You just need to explain roughly how it works.

02:07.860 --> 02:13.890
Focus on explaining the complexity of it or explaining it in a way that anyone who reads it can understand

02:13.890 --> 02:15.520
if it's simple or complex.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.460
Now similar to matching any time that you have a search engine that's another thing that you might need

02:20.460 --> 02:26.610
to write a parameter around saying what I search what exactly does it look for what is the default search.

02:26.610 --> 02:28.400
Does it look for keywords.

02:28.530 --> 02:31.550
Does it look for exact matches or look for words that start like this.

02:31.550 --> 02:34.650
Is it search my web site does it search another Web site.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.690
These are all things that you should list out in parameters.

02:37.680 --> 02:44.460
Now again parameters are just the details I like to think of it like a perimeter your kind of outlining

02:44.460 --> 02:50.090
your application and you're defining the exact perimeter of what it covers and what it does not cover.

02:50.370 --> 02:55.470
And what exactly is certain functions what they are where they are what they do.

02:56.020 --> 02:58.380
Now again you don't need to go crazy with this action.

02:58.380 --> 03:05.130
You don't need to do paragraphs and paragraphs Typically I only put in a couple parameters and really

03:05.130 --> 03:10.480
those refer back to any of the functions that we put previously that include logic.

03:10.590 --> 03:11.630
So that's all I said.

03:11.630 --> 03:16.460
Is there logic when displaying things how things could be anything right.

03:16.680 --> 03:23.340
When you open up Facebook and it has it shows you information like your news feed it shows you photos

03:23.340 --> 03:27.100
someone's post or shows you a status that someone's posted.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.890
There is logic behind that.

03:28.890 --> 03:31.390
Why did you see that photo and not a different photo.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.980
Why did you get that status update as opposed to a different one.

03:34.980 --> 03:38.810
Now you need to go back and look at your function list and try to think through your head.

03:38.820 --> 03:44.910
Are there any areas in here where there's some type of background that I would need to outline in parameters

03:45.720 --> 03:52.620
also and parameters it's helpful to list out things that are more specific like for instance I would

03:52.620 --> 03:57.150
say 25 questions for the questionnaire questionnaires are 1 through 10.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.430
That would be an appropriate place to put in parameters.

03:59.430 --> 04:03.090
Just to remind them that these are set guidelines set rules.

04:03.120 --> 04:08.610
This application has to follow if you have like a search engine or like in this case we have a matching

04:08.610 --> 04:09.120
engine.

04:09.270 --> 04:12.600
You need to say how many matches the person gets.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.930
If you're a search engine how many results should it display.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.830
So with lovely we are doing matching.

04:18.940 --> 04:25.560
So we said earlier in matches you to four to five per day ok and parameters you need to say things like

04:26.760 --> 04:31.230
what does 24 hours mean what time zone do we use for 24 hours.

04:31.230 --> 04:36.300
Try to be as specific as possible what happens exactly after 24 hours is it quite literally refresh

04:36.300 --> 04:40.340
them can you continue a conversation with someone after 24 hours.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.960
You know how do they know that it's been refreshed.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.670
What does it look like what happens if someone is viewing the application when that 24 hour deadline

04:47.940 --> 04:48.860
is over.

04:48.900 --> 04:54.420
Those are things that are worth putting into parameters to just make sure that these are the specifics

04:54.420 --> 04:58.200
that I need to cover in order for this application to run correctly.

04:58.200 --> 05:03.850
This is often the section that well miss out on a lot and it's also probably one of the more daunting

05:03.850 --> 05:10.030
ones if you're not familiar with building applications or you're not very like tech savvy but really

05:10.030 --> 05:11.780
it's just it's quite simple.

05:11.800 --> 05:18.710
Just look for any type of specifics in your function list or in your wireframe as if you've made those.

05:18.970 --> 05:23.350
OK so and I can we can go through our functions list and I can see if there's any parameters that I

05:23.350 --> 05:29.470
might want to add and I'll use that as the example to help you kind of generate ideas of what you might

05:29.470 --> 05:31.740
want to specify and what you might not want to do.

05:32.090 --> 05:34.660
So a splash page that allows users to log in with Facebook.

05:34.660 --> 05:39.970
Now you might want to list a parameter that there is only one log in type and that is Facebook.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.760
That might be something that's worth pointing out.

05:41.770 --> 05:44.710
These are very very specific thing and parameters.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.410
Again we said three areas of caution.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.810
Total of 25 or 360 years of total of 25 questions.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.580
That's something that you'd want to list in your parameters.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.650
Same thing with ranges from 1 to 10.

05:54.650 --> 06:01.210
Those are parameters obviously we'd want to talk a little bit about how exactly it matches them up in

06:01.210 --> 06:07.330
parameters we might want to say things like since they have the option to change a profile photo.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.760
Do we want to put a parameter on that.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.440
Like for instance how big of a file can they upload.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.910
Do we all do the upload massive files.

06:15.910 --> 06:21.370
Does it need to be in some kind of an aspect ratio like what happens if they upload a big landscape

06:21.370 --> 06:22.270
photograph.

06:22.420 --> 06:25.710
How does that display in the application should we reject it.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.870
What happens if they upload a file type that you don't want.

06:28.900 --> 06:31.420
These are things that you can put in the parameters.

06:31.420 --> 06:36.600
And honestly if you don't have a preference then you can leave it blank and your developer or your designer

06:36.600 --> 06:39.220
or whoever ends up having to deal with this can make a decision.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.840
And ideally if they're good at what they do they'll confer with you to make the decision.

06:43.840 --> 06:48.130
Another thing you can put in parameters if since we have an option to create a 50 word bio we could

06:48.130 --> 06:54.610
say things like parameter would be do not include any do not allow them to include any links.

06:54.610 --> 06:57.270
Do not allow them to go over 50 words.

06:57.700 --> 07:01.540
Here's another example clicking the message button populates the text message in a pre-filled message.

07:01.540 --> 07:09.070
So in this case we were building this application for Aiwass we could specify whether or not we want

07:09.070 --> 07:16.070
this to open up in a web browser or open up in their mail app or open up a secondary mail application.

07:16.090 --> 07:22.030
You could specify that you could say we don't want it opening up in a certain way we don't want certain

07:22.030 --> 07:23.610
things to populate.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.590
This is where you kind of get into the specifics.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.980
This entire section is very helpful for a developer.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.980
But again it's very optional.

07:30.010 --> 07:36.670
And then in parameters you can also talk about your administration features in your administration abilities

07:36.670 --> 07:41.860
and go into more detail so see the total numbers of the system you need to be able to see how many signed

07:41.860 --> 07:44.670
up today how many signed up in the last month.

07:44.710 --> 07:48.380
Do you need to be able to drill down on anything else.

07:48.610 --> 07:53.140
Those are kind of things that you would put in the parameters section.

07:53.290 --> 07:53.640
OK.

07:53.650 --> 07:57.510
So I just put these down so that you guys can review them.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.250
This is basically what we talked about.

07:59.260 --> 08:05.330
And one of the great things about writing out these sections again is you start to discover more complexity

08:05.330 --> 08:07.290
and more things you didn't actually think about.

08:07.630 --> 08:12.740
So here I just took a crack at explaining how the user answers will work.

08:13.050 --> 08:13.580
I can.

08:13.630 --> 08:17.290
I said Magic is based off the proximity of each user's answers.

08:17.290 --> 08:21.370
If the user has an exact match on a question that should count as 10 points within one point eight points

08:21.370 --> 08:27.790
within 2.6 points within three is for now I then said after the point at which you're four points away

08:28.120 --> 08:34.510
then it actually works negatively against you all the way up until you know the worst case scenario

08:34.510 --> 08:40.150
which is that you're 10 points away and that makes a huge negative difference and it actually outweighs

08:40.150 --> 08:42.940
the other questions that you might have gotten correctly.

08:42.940 --> 08:48.400
Now here's one part that actually kind of forgotten about how you you just specify in this case how

08:48.400 --> 08:51.020
exactly the system chooses the matches.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.250
So I just said well it matches them based off of whoever has the highest score.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.590
Now there's obviously going to be ties right.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.060
You can have a lot of perfect scores.

08:58.070 --> 09:03.070
And in that case if they're tying Who do you display so then I said it's sort's by alphabetical order

09:04.000 --> 09:06.980
and then every 24 hours it cycles and moves down the list.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.100
At first you get great matches and then over time you get worse and worse matches.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.230
That's obviously not a great idea for the long term.

09:14.230 --> 09:18.860
I would want to change that because you don't want the app to slowly get worse and worse and worse and

09:18.870 --> 09:20.500
what happens as you get new users.

09:20.500 --> 09:20.940
Right.

09:21.100 --> 09:25.150
What happens if they've seen 10 rounds of matches and then all of a sudden someone creates an account

09:25.150 --> 09:26.050
in their perfect match.

09:26.050 --> 09:27.520
They get shown next.

09:27.520 --> 09:34.610
These are things that you'd want to specify that I specified that how the 24 hour rule works.

09:34.690 --> 09:40.090
I say it's at midnight California time and then I just talked a little bit about things like should

09:40.090 --> 09:46.980
they be able to contact users after they've been matched and anything we can think of around photographs.

09:46.980 --> 09:53.170
So this obviously is not a complete batch of everything that I would put in parameters but it's a very

09:53.170 --> 09:53.890
good start.

09:53.890 --> 09:57.040
So again this is an optional section.

09:57.040 --> 10:03.140
I suggest you do it definitely helps you think about some of the questions don't ignore things like

10:03.140 --> 10:09.830
your search algorithms don't ignore things like matching and the logic behind how things get displayed

10:09.830 --> 10:11.180
how they work.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.840
What happens when you input information and they get spit back out to you.

10:14.840 --> 10:19.550
Developers need to understand this because they're trying to understand the complexity of it but don't

10:19.550 --> 10:22.200
think that this section is set in stone.

10:22.220 --> 10:23.650
You can always edit this.

10:23.690 --> 10:28.820
Just make sure that when you do edit it you're not making it significantly more complex.

10:28.820 --> 10:33.740
That's the point of this is we're trying to capture as much complexity as we can but not necessarily

10:33.830 --> 10:38.500
every single detail that you can always add kind of on the fly.

10:38.720 --> 10:49.040
All right I'll see in the next lecture.
