00:09.380 --> 00:09.740
Hey guys.

00:09.740 --> 00:14.130
Welcome back to the chorus in this section we're going to talk about legality.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.730
How does legality apply to outsourcing specifically.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.190
This is not contracting in general.

00:21.260 --> 00:27.650
I'm talking specifically about how legality applies to when you take work and you get someone in another

00:27.650 --> 00:29.220
country to do it for you.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.490
So I'm sure a lot of you run into this problem before or you're wondering dear self I'm going to select

00:34.490 --> 00:35.510
someone who is overseas.

00:35.510 --> 00:36.270
I've never met.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.260
I don't even know the city they're from.

00:38.270 --> 00:45.200
I have no instant no connection to them and I don't know if they're going to return my money back to

00:45.200 --> 00:47.990
me or they're even going to do the project once I pay them.

00:47.990 --> 00:52.640
Now if this were the case that we were working in the United States or in Europe or wherever you're

00:52.640 --> 00:58.460
taking this course you probably know exactly how you would go about dealing with someone that takes

00:58.460 --> 01:01.760
money and doesn't return what you agreed on.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.040
Now the problem here is that we now have to deal with someone who is in a separate country.

01:06.050 --> 01:12.200
Well for the practical matter of what happens if I pay someone and they don't actually give me the work

01:12.200 --> 01:12.830
that I want.

01:12.950 --> 01:16.670
Well really the only way that you address this is through prevention.

01:16.670 --> 01:23.570
There is practically no way that you can get money back from someone who works in India who didn't deliver

01:23.570 --> 01:29.210
on their promises or might have broken something in your contract it's actually it's practically impossible

01:29.210 --> 01:34.250
unless you go to India or have someone who lives there who can help you through the process and even

01:34.250 --> 01:37.010
then it could be a six month journey typically not worth it.

01:37.010 --> 01:39.620
The way we work with this is we work on prevention.

01:39.620 --> 01:45.620
So if you've contacted firm directly through if you watch any other elections or the lectures where

01:45.620 --> 01:52.130
we went through like The Firm West or we use google to find high quality freelancing firms if that's

01:52.130 --> 01:57.140
the case and you work directly through them you probably did some contract work for the most part that

01:57.140 --> 02:01.940
contract work is all just an exercise in making you feel better about the project.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.850
That's really all it comes down to.

02:03.860 --> 02:10.730
That contract might make you feel better but it's simply not going to help you actually get money back

02:10.910 --> 02:14.570
or to remedy any of the broken terms in your contract.

02:14.570 --> 02:16.650
It's really just an exercise in futility.

02:16.670 --> 02:21.920
The way that I strongly suggest you work through this problem is two things.

02:21.920 --> 02:29.900
One you use a platform like the ones we've covered to at least at the bare minimum handle the payments

02:29.990 --> 02:32.180
associated with your project.

02:32.390 --> 02:35.500
Now the way that they work is you pay them.

02:35.570 --> 02:39.730
And then once the project's done you agree to it they release it.

02:39.770 --> 02:46.610
Now if you pay them and your freelancer does not return what you expected is something something's wrong.

02:46.610 --> 02:53.120
Something you'd be in a normally into a dispute with that company will then act as the arbiter between

02:53.120 --> 02:58.280
the two of you and decide what where the money should go whether or not it's been finished what needs

02:58.280 --> 03:00.570
to happen before the money should be released.

03:00.620 --> 03:06.080
That is incredibly helpful and thankfully it's the case that a lot of freelancers a lot of freelance

03:06.080 --> 03:11.810
firms are used to this concept it's an escrow but they're also used to having these companies oversee

03:11.840 --> 03:14.020
millions of projects.

03:14.090 --> 03:18.470
Hold onto the money and then make the final determination about releasing it.

03:18.470 --> 03:23.000
The downside to that obviously is that these companies are going to take a portion of the payment as

03:23.000 --> 03:23.770
the employer.

03:23.780 --> 03:30.950
It's not as big of a deal because the companies like Elance or freelancer or up work people per hour

03:31.610 --> 03:34.580
they take the money out of the freelancers pocket.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.810
So they essentially deducted from the freelancer.

03:36.830 --> 03:42.020
Now your freelancer might bring that up and they might if you have a long term relationship ask to be

03:42.020 --> 03:43.260
compensated on that.

03:43.310 --> 03:48.620
But in my experience that 7 percent or 10 percent or whatever it ends up being sometimes it's lower

03:48.950 --> 03:50.450
is almost always worth it.

03:50.450 --> 03:55.910
It's always worth knowing that your money is at least protected in the case that something goes wrong.

03:55.910 --> 04:00.440
Now if you've had a long term relationship with a company you've worked on them several projects then

04:00.440 --> 04:05.930
it might be the case that you do not need this at all and you're perfectly fine saving those cost savings

04:05.930 --> 04:08.090
between you and your contractor.

04:08.090 --> 04:13.730
Now the other way to remedy this problem is by using a very rudimentary technique and it's called using

04:13.730 --> 04:16.460
milestones milestones you've heard of this.

04:16.460 --> 04:18.650
It's a little confusing if you never heard of it.

04:18.650 --> 04:22.610
Essentially what you're doing is you take your project and you divide it up into segments.

04:22.610 --> 04:26.210
Very similar to what we did when we wrote out our project description.

04:26.210 --> 04:31.990
But this is for the actual process of building your project you take it up and you say here's one section.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.210
Here's second section third fourth fifth whatever it is and then you say you know if our total project

04:38.210 --> 04:43.890
is say $2000 and we have five segments in our project then we'll just divide it.

04:43.970 --> 04:47.690
And every time you finish this segment you'll get paid $400.

04:47.690 --> 04:53.360
So what ends up happening is the freelancers will work on one portion and then once you see that it

04:53.360 --> 04:57.950
works see that it's good see that it matches the requirements see that they deliver it on time.

04:57.950 --> 05:00.350
There's no issues you release that milestone.

05:00.350 --> 05:03.910
Then you go to the next section then you go to the next section and you do that until the project's

05:03.940 --> 05:04.370
finished.

05:04.370 --> 05:11.150
Now the downside to this obviously is that for the freelancer they might get a little skittish about

05:11.150 --> 05:16.820
this because they're afraid that you might say only give them a portion of the money or not be happy

05:16.820 --> 05:18.730
right after the first section of work.

05:18.740 --> 05:25.100
But unfortunately this is kind of the standard even if you use Elance or up work in any of those escrow

05:25.100 --> 05:28.340
services they're going to make you put everything into milestones anyway.

05:28.430 --> 05:29.860
So that's typically what they're used to.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.260
Now there's hope.

05:31.520 --> 05:37.790
It really runs the gamut in terms of like all the different types of milestones set up so you can get

05:37.820 --> 05:40.800
a lot of people do 50 percent upfront 50 percent at the end.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.310
That is better than paying 100 percent upfront.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.860
But it's not nearly as good as say segmenting it out say you pay 20 percent up front and then you say

05:49.940 --> 05:54.620
you pay out the other 80 percent over the course of four different milestones.

05:54.620 --> 06:01.080
In general it's going to yes it's a negative for the freelancer but it also creates a little bit.

06:01.160 --> 06:06.880
It slows your project down ever so slightly because now all of a sudden you have four different milestones.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.550
This means you have four different checkpoints where they have to present their work to you or wait

06:10.550 --> 06:15.350
for you to prove it and then you have to go through it and make sure that everything is to the tee.

06:15.380 --> 06:17.890
A lot of times you say this milestone is not done.

06:17.930 --> 06:20.330
I want you to go back and fix this and this and this.

06:20.450 --> 06:24.800
Whereas if you did this in one big milestone you would have told them to fix everything at the very

06:24.800 --> 06:27.550
end so you lose a little bit of efficiency.

06:27.560 --> 06:33.250
But at the same time you really do save yourself from getting burned on putting up too much money up

06:33.250 --> 06:33.610
front.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.490
So that's the best way.

06:35.510 --> 06:43.220
It all practicality of preventing yourself from getting burned legally in a freelancer relationship.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.780
Use an escrow service.

06:44.780 --> 06:48.960
They're very easy to use even if you made the arrangement outside of the escrow service.

06:49.070 --> 06:53.510
Ask them to then go on to the service and bid on a private project.

06:53.510 --> 06:59.930
You can use that then you can use say Lantz's service to maintain the work and at an absolute minimum

06:59.930 --> 07:05.120
use a milestone system with them have that in writing so they know exactly what they need to reach to

07:05.120 --> 07:11.000
get paid and just use that kind of a way of preventing yourself from getting burned once you then get

07:11.000 --> 07:14.970
used to that person you can pick really whatever you want to whatever arrangement you think works.

07:14.980 --> 07:20.170
Now legally what happens if something really does end up blowing up.

07:20.510 --> 07:23.550
What happens if they take your idea and they steal it.

07:23.780 --> 07:30.170
Well unfortunately there's not much you can do because the legality around outsourcing is virtually

07:30.170 --> 07:31.890
nonexistent.

07:31.940 --> 07:37.280
Luckily if you use E or you use up work and those Web sites they have their own terms and agreements

07:37.580 --> 07:42.150
they have a long list the agreements that protect you in some ways.

07:42.180 --> 07:47.870
So you can opt to have intellectual property protection and not include that in the legal contract you

07:47.870 --> 07:49.270
make with your freelancer.

07:49.270 --> 07:52.490
However what happens if that person does actually steal your idea.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.840
Well really nothing.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.860
I mean there's virtually nothing they can do.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.580
The only thing you can rely on is that you can rely on the fact that you used the techniques in this

08:01.580 --> 08:07.970
course to pick a good freelancer a responsible trustworthy freelancer that most importantly has a track

08:07.970 --> 08:08.790
record.

08:08.840 --> 08:15.770
That's the biggest thing you can use to prevent a legality issue like say IP theft is that you look

08:15.770 --> 08:18.160
for someone who has a reputation to protect.

08:18.290 --> 08:25.520
If they have 50 projects on their L.A. profile and this is a big source of income from that for them

08:25.580 --> 08:31.340
they're not going to want to jeopardize that over some small issue depending on how large a project

08:31.340 --> 08:33.000
is it's just never worth it.

08:33.110 --> 08:40.490
The shallow or their work history is the less inclined they're going to be to use to understand what

08:40.490 --> 08:42.660
they have to lose in this type of situation.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.900
But if they have a track record they're going be a lot more committed to doing everything right.

08:46.910 --> 08:48.670
It is a lot less to worry about.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.320
But in general make sure that you're aware of this.

08:51.320 --> 08:59.030
It is kind of the Wild Wild West because it is virtually impossible in a lot of these countries to sue

08:59.030 --> 09:02.750
them or to have some legal action against the person you hired.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.440
Why is that.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.240
I mean it's solely because we have court systems in every single country.

09:07.430 --> 09:12.370
They work within that country and they don't have any way of interacting between the two.

09:12.440 --> 09:17.840
We had sprung kick of had disputes with Canadian companies and we're in San Francisco and even those

09:17.840 --> 09:22.080
two countries that are very very similar and cooperate on so many different things.

09:22.100 --> 09:26.150
We have no Regel we have no legal remedy against them.

09:26.150 --> 09:31.600
But in retrospect we could have saved ourselves by just using simple prevention techniques.

09:31.610 --> 09:32.880
So be aware.

09:32.900 --> 09:33.820
Legality.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.660
There's nothing you can really do.

09:35.660 --> 09:38.500
You can't sue someone outside the country.

09:38.600 --> 09:43.190
And if you can and a lot of situations you can it's very rarely worth it.

09:43.250 --> 09:49.310
Only if you're doing a multimillion dollar project would it ever make sense to establish a presence

09:49.310 --> 09:54.110
in another country and then pursue them legally the way that you protect yourself legally is use very

09:54.110 --> 10:01.340
practical common sense prevention methods use milestones use escrow services make sure everything you're

10:01.340 --> 10:07.670
doing is written out in writing not because it makes it legal but because you can now know exactly what

10:07.670 --> 10:08.420
is expected.

10:09.070 --> 10:13.740
And what you should be receiving and there's no miscommunication between the two of you do you guys

10:13.740 --> 10:18.170
have any questions at all or any stories about this post in the group discussion.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.840
More than willing to go into depth with this kind of in-general.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.550
There are some exceptions there are a couple of countries where I've heard of people be able to do small

10:26.550 --> 10:32.220
claims court decisions against other companies but in general it's just not something you should plan

10:32.220 --> 10:35.550
on relying on if you have legal concerns.

10:35.550 --> 10:41.240
Then honestly you should use prevention techniques to protect yourself and if honestly past that point

10:41.250 --> 10:45.180
you don't feel safe enough then it's probably the case that you shouldn't be outsourcing.

10:45.180 --> 10:53.800
OK guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
