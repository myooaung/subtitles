WEBVTT

00:05.970 --> 00:12.480
All right let's spend a little bit of time checking out e Lance Lance was the web site I mentioned previously.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.350
It's by far my favorite Web site for finding freelancers.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.680
The quality of freelancers are much higher.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.600
They're a little bit different than the other two.

00:21.600 --> 00:29.310
I'm going to show you the way that they work behind the scenes as they make their money off number one

00:29.320 --> 00:30.930
featured postings.

00:31.170 --> 00:37.920
And number two they charge a percentage to the freelancer of about eight point seventy five percent.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.810
Now you might think that's a lot of money.

00:40.050 --> 00:44.880
And it kind of is especially if you're paying and a large project or you're having an ongoing relationship

00:44.880 --> 00:50.370
with a freelancer but compared to the other ones it's actually a much lower freelancer for instance

00:50.550 --> 00:55.430
charges 15 percent Lance has about 2 million freelancers.

00:55.470 --> 00:56.200
Sounds like a lot.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.050
It's actually less than the other two.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.900
But in my experience they're much higher quality.

01:02.010 --> 01:02.770
They are.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.290
It's actually a big company.

01:04.290 --> 01:08.060
Surprisingly they make about 800 million dollars a year.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.890
There also we're a venture capital darling.

01:10.890 --> 01:14.840
They have taken something like 78 million dollars in funding.

01:15.300 --> 01:23.070
So we'll just log on and show you generally kind of what it looks like what buttons and what areas you're

01:23.070 --> 01:26.980
going to navigate around when you go to post.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.830
Post your first job.

01:29.130 --> 01:35.070
So if you've played around with any of these three web sites before you Lance is by far the cleanest

01:35.070 --> 01:41.010
in terms of the user interface they separate everything out into my Lantz's where they have all of your

01:41.770 --> 01:44.570
your tasks and jobs that you've posted.

01:44.700 --> 01:49.650
Hiring This is where you would go if you wanted to post a job where you actually wanted to do the opposite

01:50.010 --> 01:55.020
which is you find an individual freelancer first as opposed to posting a job and letting the freelancer

01:55.020 --> 01:56.960
freind find you.

01:57.030 --> 02:03.870
There are some other features on here that I'm not going to really cover but they do have quite a robust

02:03.870 --> 02:09.270
product and has a lot of different things on here that a lot of you might have find to be pretty useful

02:09.270 --> 02:12.740
that I don't particularly use when I use plants.

02:12.780 --> 02:18.290
So the way that you post the job is you would just simply go to a poster job.

02:18.320 --> 02:25.460
This is the simplest by far and it looks very simple similar to every other job posting site you've

02:25.460 --> 02:29.530
seen it says job but really they mean project.

02:29.720 --> 02:36.050
You can make it like a job because later you're going to be able to select per hour or per project and

02:36.230 --> 02:41.660
later in the course we're going to talk in depth about whether or not you want to use per project or

02:41.660 --> 02:42.500
per hour.

02:42.680 --> 02:47.840
Really depends on the project that you're doing and it depends on you specifically how much experience

02:47.840 --> 02:48.770
you have.

02:49.220 --> 02:54.020
We're also going to cover how you should work on titles and descriptions and when to do in a later time

02:54.080 --> 02:55.820
and really get into depth with it.

02:56.030 --> 03:00.050
But we're just trying to get familiar with how their web site looks.

03:00.050 --> 03:04.000
So you put the title of your job description goes here.

03:04.010 --> 03:10.760
There is a 4000 character limit the way that you get around that is you would write as much as you can

03:10.760 --> 03:19.280
in the described section and then you would attach an attachment a Word document with the actual multi-page

03:19.520 --> 03:21.930
definition of what you're trying to build.

03:22.040 --> 03:27.440
That's they do they do that because they don't want people to go and look at a posting and just see

03:27.680 --> 03:31.870
an enormous amount of text they can describe it as your overview.

03:31.910 --> 03:37.580
You give the overview the key details kind of give some information around who you want specifically

03:37.580 --> 03:43.310
what type of person you're looking for and who should not bid and then put the actual details in the

03:43.310 --> 03:45.460
attachment so they can pre-qualify themselves.

03:45.470 --> 03:49.860
They can read that first description and then they can move on to the attachment if they're interested.

03:50.030 --> 03:55.680
Category of work you'll notice that they're all kind of the same and all of these Web sites and men

03:55.690 --> 03:58.840
support is typically like virtual assistance.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.870
People need to make phone calls Excel sheets things like that.

04:01.970 --> 04:08.300
You can find graphic designers on here graphic design firms were specifically talking web applications

04:08.300 --> 04:09.230
mobile applications.

04:09.230 --> 04:14.270
But if you have a physical hardware project and that is your startup you can go into engineering manufacturing

04:14.270 --> 04:19.790
too and there are some really talented people on here so early that you can find in legal and finance

04:20.240 --> 04:25.880
people who can give you for instance in legal legal advice regarding your startup regarding what you're

04:25.880 --> 04:27.070
trying to do.

04:27.470 --> 04:34.070
And also in finance You'd be surprised you can find some part time CTA CFOs people who are quite good

04:34.070 --> 04:35.750
at giving you financial advice.

04:35.750 --> 04:40.090
Doing your books doing your cost projections.

04:40.160 --> 04:48.530
People who can look over your pro-forma Profar financials performer means just in the future that's

04:48.530 --> 04:53.450
typically a Excel calculation you'll make where you're predicting how much you think your startup will

04:53.450 --> 04:54.050
make.

04:54.050 --> 04:57.780
If you go the venture capital and you're not taking this course because you want to make a lifestyle

04:57.800 --> 05:00.590
business you will have to do something like that.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.180
And it's a useful tool to do.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.560
Anyway I digress.

05:04.940 --> 05:08.330
Your typical is going to be looking under I.T. and programming.

05:08.330 --> 05:14.450
You can also use people in marketing writing translation really a very broad group of people you can

05:14.450 --> 05:16.440
hire through this website.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.850
So you know it's like a subcategory.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.580
Technically you don't even have to.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.060
There's another way of doing this.

05:22.340 --> 05:27.330
And a lot of times depending on your application there might be you know I have a very specific skill

05:27.330 --> 05:33.320
set you're looking for or you're building is very specific in general if that's the case and I usually

05:33.320 --> 05:39.560
just typically live out leave out select subcategory and I use the request specific skills or groups

05:39.830 --> 05:49.010
and then I'll type in something very specific and you'll notice like you use an or.

05:49.670 --> 05:52.630
So this would be an example.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.960
Maybe you want to build an e-commerce platform you don't just want someone who's skilled and just regular

05:56.960 --> 06:00.740
e-commerce you don't you know you have your specific about what you want to use you don't want to use

06:00.740 --> 06:07.450
Shopify or you don't want to use a like Wick's or Magento you want to use and car you can do Zenn car

06:07.460 --> 06:09.160
and I can add that as a skill.

06:09.200 --> 06:15.890
Now anybody who's listed Zen Cart will get that message and they all essentially be head up and they'll

06:15.890 --> 06:20.480
be brought to your project and they will show it don't ask them to kind of bid.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.430
So that's a great way of honing in.

06:22.430 --> 06:27.150
Typically then what I would end up doing is I would select skills that are complimentary to that that

06:27.150 --> 06:28.570
you would kind of assume.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.740
So like ph p.

06:32.020 --> 06:39.220
And then I would pick say ph Pique's that's the language that Zen card has made in cake THP is a framework.

06:39.320 --> 06:44.740
If that's something specifically you wanted to use I try to keep it broad because typically someone

06:44.740 --> 06:54.460
who is skilled in say ph before ph 5 ph PBB which is a forum they're also going to get messages for

06:54.490 --> 06:57.750
PH P some kind of wasting my time by saying four or five.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.310
Or cake ph.

06:59.560 --> 07:04.570
The only time I would say something specific like I'd select cake is if I've already built my application

07:04.570 --> 07:07.580
I'm looking for another freelancer and I use cake.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.480
So I got to make sure that they're good at that.

07:09.490 --> 07:14.150
So just say Ph.D. if you notice on a sidebar here.

07:14.590 --> 07:20.650
This is actually kind of cool you can just use your job templates if you're posting a job a repeat job

07:21.010 --> 07:25.120
or you're posting a job that's very similar to something you posted before you can actually just pull

07:25.120 --> 07:29.980
it up on the side and it will automatically drop in all of the details.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.690
You don't have to redo that over again.

07:32.720 --> 07:38.320
See also they do this the popular job template.

07:38.410 --> 07:41.950
This is actually quite helpful is it first time you're doing it so you do want to get a logo design

07:41.950 --> 07:42.550
done.

07:42.580 --> 07:46.270
You could pick logo design and it will drop in

07:49.550 --> 07:51.520
there you.

07:52.170 --> 07:54.590
So it's going to give you a separate form to fill out.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.340
And it's been a point you kind of in the right direction.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.500
Like what type of Logo are you looking for.

08:00.740 --> 08:05.550
And you can get see they've designed this for people who are making logos and verli looks like they've

08:05.550 --> 08:09.560
already selected your skill for you or your section.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.810
The last thing is you know you'll notice there's a fixed price again hourly.

08:12.930 --> 08:16.880
What I like about you and you won't notice listening to is when you say fix price.

08:17.070 --> 08:23.850
You can actually say your own range and you could say decide later that's really helpful.

08:23.850 --> 08:29.690
One of the biggest problems of the other two is that you have to determine your range beforehand.

08:29.850 --> 08:36.810
And so what was happening is you'd say like this and you don't always know how much the application

08:36.810 --> 08:37.730
cost.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.920
So maybe someone will make it for $300.

08:39.930 --> 08:45.140
What the system is going to do it's going to say no it's between 500 and 1000 You can't be below that.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.390
L.A. does not have that problem.

08:47.460 --> 08:52.770
So you can put a suggestion and then people will bid around that.

08:52.890 --> 08:56.330
Here's the biggest thing I think you should pay attention to when you do.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.920
If you do fixed price or hourly.

09:00.180 --> 09:06.080
I always do decide later always again decide later.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.190
And why do I do that.

09:08.220 --> 09:15.360
Because freelancers are very much influenced by the price you set.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.200
It's an anchor point.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.950
So if I'm building an application I think it's in a cost $4000.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.690
And I say it's worth you know I say my budget is no.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.420
1 2 5 0 0 0 0 dollars.

09:26.420 --> 09:31.740
Or let's say OK let's scratch Let's say I think my projects were $6000.

09:31.740 --> 09:38.040
So I would say five to $10000 what will happen is you will have freelancers who would build this for

09:38.040 --> 09:41.720
$4000 or three or $2000.

09:41.730 --> 09:46.900
But they see that your budget is five to 10 and they're more likely going a bit higher.

09:46.950 --> 09:53.220
That has happened pretty much every single time I've done this where I've set my own price so you are

09:53.220 --> 09:58.290
going to influence their bids and a lot of them are just going assume that you don't know the actual

09:58.290 --> 10:01.250
price or they're going to assume that they're wrong.

10:01.260 --> 10:07.110
The point is if you say decide later they're in the dark they need to come up with their own price and

10:07.110 --> 10:09.910
that's what you want them to do any way you want them to think about it.

10:09.930 --> 10:15.610
They want them to pitch their price to you based on what the analysis they've done of what you've written.

10:15.610 --> 10:15.830
Right.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.410
You don't want them to be to look at other people's bids and base it off of that.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.670
That's the lazy way.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.210
That's the inaccurate way.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.050
Location privacy other options.

10:25.110 --> 10:30.910
This is you can set it as public you can allow Google to index it.

10:30.930 --> 10:36.330
That's definitely something you want to do unless you think you have some IP protection issues so if

10:36.330 --> 10:41.440
you're pitching something and you don't want to get out there maybe you don't want to check that.

10:42.270 --> 10:45.480
But you can also prefer people from a certain location.

10:45.580 --> 10:50.070
This actually in my experience doesn't work particularly well because.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.230
So like for instance it says select a region OK.

10:54.420 --> 11:04.260
Like I said North America that is really imprecise North America also mind you includes Central America

11:04.380 --> 11:05.220
Mexico.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.110
It includes the Caribbean.

11:07.110 --> 11:09.380
So maybe that's not something I want.

11:09.540 --> 11:14.400
But of course I could have selected North America because I like the time zones but realistically I

11:14.410 --> 11:17.770
selected North America because I want an American or Canadian.

11:17.970 --> 11:23.160
That's why I really hate the way they do this because even if I say you know there's a lot of these

11:23.160 --> 11:28.240
kind of loopholes too it seems so like Australia.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.270
OCEANA.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.350
I mean I want Australia right.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.340
But that also brings up things like Papa New Guinea.

11:34.390 --> 11:41.400
I think that also I might actually bring in like Indonesian bidders and people from like small islands

11:41.400 --> 11:42.740
like now roo and things like that.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.660
It's really kind of bizarre.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.420
So I very rarely use that.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.860
This is a problem with the plants.

11:48.930 --> 11:49.930
You can do country.

11:49.950 --> 11:55.770
But again this drives me nuts too because I want to say multiple countries and the other ones you can

11:55.770 --> 11:57.960
do that anyway and you're kind of just screwed.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.880
I mean you have to pick one country so you'd pick the United States.

12:01.920 --> 12:07.320
This is cool because you can actually go down and drill down to the city and state if the case is that

12:07.320 --> 12:11.450
you feel more comfortable working with someone in your own city or within driving distance.

12:11.610 --> 12:12.700
That's something you can do.

12:12.720 --> 12:18.000
And so you can sit with them sometimes and actually have face to face later we're going to talk about

12:18.000 --> 12:23.340
graphic designers and how that can be very advantageous to have someone who works in your city and someone

12:23.340 --> 12:27.830
who you can meet for coffee to go over designs with developers.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.660
That's not really not particularly the case.

12:30.930 --> 12:36.620
Developers are not going to get as much from meeting them face to face.

12:36.780 --> 12:40.110
And that's something that they're going to find quite annoying and it's going be kind of distracting

12:40.110 --> 12:43.320
for them so I don't think you're going to get much out of it.

12:43.530 --> 12:48.030
Typically when you meet with them it's kind of the idea that maybe they can showcase what they so far

12:48.330 --> 12:52.740
with development it's just a case that if you meet them halfway through the project they can't show

12:52.740 --> 12:54.130
you half your Web site.

12:54.180 --> 12:56.810
That's just not how programming works.

12:56.830 --> 12:58.440
Propose start date.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.740
You can do it immediately.

12:59.770 --> 13:05.190
It launches right after you launch it just gives them a quick review period and where you could set

13:05.520 --> 13:06.840
a date in the future.

13:07.740 --> 13:12.750
Later in the course as an extra What I want to do is we're going to go through a live demo and I'm going

13:12.750 --> 13:21.570
to make up a web application show you had a wireframe that show you how to disk write the project or

13:21.570 --> 13:26.060
scription the project specifications post it and then select someone.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.540
But right now we're just getting you used to Elance.

13:28.560 --> 13:34.270
And at this point in the course you should just be familiar with it and kind of.

13:34.290 --> 13:39.810
No I want to encourage you to actually go and play with these web sites so that you get more comfortable

13:39.810 --> 13:41.280
with them.

13:41.280 --> 13:49.330
The other thing is I want to point out with Elance would be one when you search you have two options.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.870
You can search for jobs or freelancers.

13:52.200 --> 13:57.470
You can also search for a portfolio samples but that's never really seems to work out particularly well.

13:57.540 --> 14:02.040
So one benefit is that you can say freelancers.

14:02.160 --> 14:07.710
So let's say you wanted to build an application I can borrow something from a project I did before.

14:07.710 --> 14:14.450
Twilley So let's say I wanted to look for freelancers that are skilled in Twilio because again maybe

14:14.450 --> 14:16.700
I have a very specific idea of what I want to build.

14:16.800 --> 14:22.200
I don't want to post a job I would rather go after individual freelancers and try to recruit them that

14:22.200 --> 14:23.220
way.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.140
So I can say Tullio

14:27.810 --> 14:30.070
excuse my computer.

14:30.120 --> 14:36.070
OK so you can see people here that advertise themselves with Twilio to Ilya.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.920
And if they're advertising themselves saying that they're good at Twilio chances are that's one of the

14:40.920 --> 14:44.710
things this subtitle page right here.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.760
It's limited by characters.

14:47.760 --> 14:53.990
So you actually surf there putting it up there that means there are other big things that they do.

14:54.150 --> 14:55.870
And again you can drill down.

14:56.070 --> 14:58.220
We could say zip code.

14:58.860 --> 14:59.350
OK.

14:59.460 --> 15:05.620
Like I was saying you could look based on distance.

15:06.090 --> 15:13.650
And so when I put a 9 4 1 0 9 that is the zip code for San Francisco and now I can see people who are

15:13.650 --> 15:21.680
good at Twilio in my area to see here's a tweet Liow developer he's an expert Tullio developer.

15:21.780 --> 15:27.100
This is California so he's about $49 an hour sixty six seventy nine dollars an hour.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.370
So if that's what you wanted to do you can do that.

15:29.370 --> 15:33.660
L.A. is the place to do that if you want to look for an individual local freelancer.

15:33.660 --> 15:38.760
I think it's a it's a good way of doing it but that options available for you if you're trying to do

15:38.760 --> 15:41.910
something really specific that helps.

15:41.910 --> 15:48.720
I also suggest that when you post your job posting and you go ahead and search for freelancers Anyway

15:49.230 --> 15:53.910
look for people who have very specific skills to what you're trying to build and you can individually

15:53.910 --> 15:55.370
recruit them.

15:55.980 --> 15:58.750
And the way that you do that is you just say like hire me.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.300
It's a button.

15:59.310 --> 16:05.040
And what I'll do is it'll prompt you to send them a message and invite them to your job posting and

16:05.040 --> 16:11.700
that will help considerably because you post your job posting and it's a generic you know a Ph based

16:12.480 --> 16:14.030
forum Web site.

16:14.400 --> 16:19.170
It's only going to attract so many people because so many people there are only so many people who are

16:19.170 --> 16:20.470
actively browsing.

16:20.580 --> 16:26.250
But if you actually yourself go out and look for some people you want you can dramatically kind of increase

16:26.250 --> 16:31.710
the participation in your job by individually going after people and saying I want and you know I want

16:31.710 --> 16:36.730
to I want invite people to my project.

16:36.730 --> 16:41.610
And if you invite them directly the odds of them bidding are significantly higher.

16:41.610 --> 16:46.260
Probably 60 70 percent will end up actually providing a bed.

16:46.890 --> 16:49.260
And then alternatively you can search for jobs.

16:49.270 --> 16:52.310
I like this because so let's try this again.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.400
Say Twilley.

16:53.790 --> 17:00.350
The reason why I do this is in NY this is helpful is because I can go and look at other people's jobs.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.560
And sometimes when I'm writing descriptions running specifications I kind of get stuck.

17:04.560 --> 17:10.110
I've written everything I can think of and I can think that could be on it but I would be curious to

17:10.110 --> 17:13.740
see what other people are saying and so what you can do is you can search for other jobs.

17:13.800 --> 17:19.680
I can look at say a mobile application that might include this and I can kind of search their listing

17:19.680 --> 17:25.530
to see if there's any information around Twilley that might be useful or something they included I can

17:25.530 --> 17:31.170
think of and that's what this is where I've gotten a lot of my kind of a lot of the things that put

17:31.170 --> 17:36.960
it into my specifications for them because over time I've kind of just made a compounding list of the

17:36.980 --> 17:39.990
things I need to remember to mention.

17:40.050 --> 17:45.840
So here's an interesting that they listed out the Twilio SDK.

17:45.980 --> 17:50.940
I'm not sure why want to do that but that's something that a poet.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.100
So maybe there's someone who does Twilley.

17:53.140 --> 18:00.970
But they are not familiar with the with putting it on an application for Android or iOS So you put it

18:00.970 --> 18:01.470
there.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.130
That could be helpful.

18:03.130 --> 18:10.410
So anyway that's a way that I've put together a really good specification sheet like master template.

18:10.630 --> 18:14.590
I've just gone through and looked at other projects that are similar to what I'm posting.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.150
I noticed that people are really good at it.

18:16.170 --> 18:24.780
And so I've just kind of borrowed some of the things that they have done lasy manage.

18:24.910 --> 18:27.760
This is kind of the section where you do things like payments.

18:27.820 --> 18:32.770
You can also deal with files and you know transactions in your team.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.780
I mentioned earlier oDesk is the thing called Team view.

18:35.810 --> 18:39.480
Elance has emerged with oDesk So they've actually added that.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.510
So you can go to your team and you can add people to it.

18:43.510 --> 18:50.170
Right now it's just me but I could add a new team member and what it'll do is it'll ask me of all the

18:50.170 --> 18:55.180
people in my projects who have I hired it will show a list of them I can select someone add them to

18:55.180 --> 18:56.820
my team.

18:56.860 --> 19:04.600
What that allows me to do is it allows me to keep everyone kind of in one space but also I can ask them

19:04.600 --> 19:06.330
to do time tracking.

19:06.730 --> 19:13.460
That's something I've never used with Elance but it's actually a possibility if he wanted to do that.

19:13.510 --> 19:16.490
That again is something that you might want to do if you're doing per hour.

19:16.510 --> 19:18.990
Because want to make sure that they are working for how long.

19:19.030 --> 19:20.650
They're saying that they're working

19:23.800 --> 19:28.090
do.
