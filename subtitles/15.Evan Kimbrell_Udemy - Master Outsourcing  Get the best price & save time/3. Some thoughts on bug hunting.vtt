Talk a little bit about biogs you're probably thinking to yourself we mean bugs if I'm paying the developer

00:13.210 --> 00:15.790
shouldn't they deliver me something that's perfect.

00:15.900 --> 00:19.800
I want you to know that in every single application there are going to be bugs.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.710
Nothing comes off perfect in the first version.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.860
Please don't be discouraged when there are bugs.

00:24.870 --> 00:28.560
Please do not be discouraged when you come back and you have lots of bugs.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.700
Typically the more you pay a developer the less bugs are going to see.

00:31.830 --> 00:34.140
That's something you associate with a good developer.

00:34.160 --> 00:40.290
However the best developer in the world will still have bugs you cannot or she cannot take into consideration

00:40.320 --> 00:43.950
every single possible thing that could go wrong with your application.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.690
So be realistic.

00:45.690 --> 00:51.190
If you saved a lot of money on your application when you contracted it out then chances are you're going

00:51.200 --> 00:56.520
to make up for it with putting in a little bit of extra effort trying to find bugs and going through

00:56.520 --> 00:59.920
some back and forth till you get your application perfect.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.950
The first version to be honest it could be quite scary could have a lot of issues to it.

01:04.950 --> 01:08.790
I've had projects that came out that were completely mangled and I've had them come out where they are

01:08.880 --> 01:09.730
quite good.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.060
It still had bugs.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.290
Just don't be afraid.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.570
Follow the next section.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.950
Followed my advice.

01:16.050 --> 01:20.810
Put in a little bit of effort and make sure you follow up with your developer wants your products at

01:20.820 --> 01:21.600
purrfect.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.560
You honestly won't even recognize it anymore since the one that they first launched when they send it

01:25.560 --> 01:35.990
to you expect bugs to be realistic about that.
