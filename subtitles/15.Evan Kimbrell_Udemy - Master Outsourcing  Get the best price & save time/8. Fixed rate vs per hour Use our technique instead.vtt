00:00.640 --> 00:00.870
It

00:06.000 --> 00:11.130
inevitably when you list your project you're going to run into the question of whether or not you should

00:11.130 --> 00:14.820
do a fixed rate where a per hour project.

00:14.820 --> 00:21.090
Most studios you'll talk to will prefer a per hour because they understand that most projects will always

00:21.090 --> 00:25.650
have things that slip through the cracks things that aren't listed out in the specifications for the

00:25.650 --> 00:31.310
project and they get paid on a piecemeal basis to cover the entire project.

00:31.410 --> 00:38.100
That's a little bit idealistic I would say because most people who list their projects are not going

00:38.100 --> 00:42.510
to want to just have an open ended budget like that they're not going to want to say yeah a hundred

00:42.510 --> 00:46.520
dollars an hour until it's finished because I can get out of hand very quickly.

00:46.580 --> 00:52.230
And you kind of need to rely on the expertise of the freelancer or the firm to tell you how long this

00:52.230 --> 00:54.780
is going to take and then you want them to stick to that timeline.

00:55.870 --> 01:03.310
So what are the pros and cons associated with fixed cost and per hour projects with a fixed cost.

01:03.310 --> 01:08.260
Obviously the biggest pro is that you can save a lot of money when people give you a fixed cost.

01:08.250 --> 01:14.950
It is inevitably going to be lower than what it actually would cost per hour mainly because they know

01:14.950 --> 01:18.740
that when they give you a fixed cost price you're comparing it against other people.

01:18.790 --> 01:22.460
And so they have a very strong incentive to keep that number down.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.700
Obviously be aware of people who pitch you prices that are abnormally low that means are probably cutting

01:28.700 --> 01:34.390
too many corners and they're assuming this is a lot smaller of a project than it probably really is.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.140
But the biggest cost savings come from fixed price projects.

01:39.140 --> 01:44.060
Now also an advantage of fixed price is that you can know going into it what exactly your budget should

01:44.060 --> 01:44.950
be.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.570
If they say that your projects and it costs $2000 or a thousand dollars that is a good indication of

01:50.570 --> 01:52.280
what your budget should be.

01:52.280 --> 01:58.280
However always keep a contingency fund just in case there are things outside of the scope of the application

01:58.640 --> 02:04.230
that you're going to need to rehire the freelancer or the firm to go back and add.

02:04.260 --> 02:09.030
Now the biggest con to the fixed price project in my eyes is the negative incentive structure that it

02:09.030 --> 02:10.220
creates.

02:10.230 --> 02:14.730
Let's say that you've engaged with a firm to build your application.

02:14.820 --> 02:20.250
Now if they said it's going to cost $800 that is the pre-agreed amount.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.270
Now how did they get to that.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.220
A hundred dollars.

02:22.230 --> 02:27.990
Well for them they're going to try as much as possible to cut costs when in the middle of the project

02:27.990 --> 02:32.880
if they see something that's going to cry extra effort they're simply going to ignore it because they

02:32.880 --> 02:35.580
want it to be exactly around that $800.

02:35.700 --> 02:39.990
And it gives them a huge incentive to go below eight hundred dollars so that they can have a profit

02:39.990 --> 02:41.390
line.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.730
This is not the case with freelancers However they will do the same thing.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.370
They budget in their head how long this is going to take.

02:47.370 --> 02:49.520
That's how they calculate your fixed price.

02:49.590 --> 02:54.620
And when it goes over that amount of time you can find some really negative things will happen.

02:54.630 --> 02:58.950
The freelancer might cut back on the amount of time they're dedicated to the project.

02:58.950 --> 03:05.340
They might start delivering lower quality code all of the headaches you've heard about people working

03:05.340 --> 03:11.800
with contractors typically has to do with fixed price projects and on the other side of the table you're

03:11.820 --> 03:15.900
the one who contracted out an eight hundred dollar project you're going to try to squeeze out every

03:15.900 --> 03:22.470
single bit of value out of that as you can probably you know argue later down the line that your specifications

03:22.560 --> 03:26.720
actually said that they should do more and more and more.

03:26.890 --> 03:32.260
So you have two forces working in opposite directions and they're not working towards each other which

03:32.260 --> 03:34.830
is the way they should because you both should be on the same page.

03:34.870 --> 03:40.600
You want to create the best product and not just fulfill the requirements that you've written to the

03:40.600 --> 03:42.310
best you can.

03:42.310 --> 03:48.550
At the end of the day getting a cheap project bid is not worth the chance that the freelancer or the

03:48.550 --> 03:54.300
contracting firm ends up losing interest of the project or ends up bailing on it.

03:54.340 --> 03:59.490
If you notice on freelancer dot com they list out the completion rate because they have so many freelancers

03:59.500 --> 04:04.720
they have people who underbid everyone else and then what you'll notice is an average completion rate

04:04.720 --> 04:06.450
might be 70 percent.

04:06.460 --> 04:11.410
So what happens if you're that 30 percent that can really kind of screw up your project and it can really

04:11.410 --> 04:14.830
add months to your timeline for launch.

04:14.860 --> 04:18.620
On the other hand we have the option of paying per hour.

04:19.030 --> 04:23.830
Obviously the advantage of per hour is you don't have to have the same kind of stress between you and

04:23.830 --> 04:24.970
the contractor.

04:24.970 --> 04:28.310
They know that whatever effort they put in is going to get paid.

04:28.330 --> 04:33.790
So there are going to focus on making the product as good as possible because they know that if they

04:33.790 --> 04:36.710
put an overtime hours they're going to get paid for it.

04:37.630 --> 04:44.530
Per our projects also make it such that you don't have to stick to your requirements to the T because

04:44.530 --> 04:48.370
the requirements are helpful for the developer to understand what they're building.

04:48.370 --> 04:53.170
But it's also to help them understand what is getting paid for and what isn't They're paying per hour.

04:53.170 --> 04:58.900
You can very easily and fluently add things to your specifications and you also don't need to make a

04:58.900 --> 05:03.940
very long packet of information for them because you know that whenever they have questions about what

05:03.940 --> 05:05.930
to build you can answered at that time.

05:05.950 --> 05:12.640
So if the idea of what you're trying to build isn't 100 percent concrete you can instead opt to use

05:12.640 --> 05:18.520
a per hour agreement and then spend less time upfront building your requirements and specifications

05:18.700 --> 05:21.620
and more time as the project progresses.

05:21.940 --> 05:26.440
This allows you an advantage that you can build something and as you see it getting belt you can change

05:26.440 --> 05:26.700
it.

05:26.710 --> 05:30.680
You can modify it and you kind of tweak in whatever direction that you think you should go with it.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.480
The obvious disadvantage of paying per hour is that you don't know what your budget is going to be.

05:36.490 --> 05:41.340
And it happens a lot of the time that the budget will just get out from under you.

05:41.380 --> 05:46.700
You expected to spend a couple of thousand dollars and you know after a couple of months or you know

05:46.750 --> 05:53.650
$5000 that can happen essentially you're not keeping tabs on what's being done how long it's taking

05:54.040 --> 05:59.020
it makes it very hard upfront to know what it's going to cost at the very end.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.170
Another disadvantage is that it inevitably is more expensive.

06:02.320 --> 06:07.240
If I ask someone what their per hour wage is they're going to pitch me something that's way higher than

06:07.270 --> 06:10.020
if I ask them how much a project would cost.

06:10.060 --> 06:13.480
That is roughly equivalent of say eight hours of work.

06:13.810 --> 06:17.100
It's just something about psychology and the way that people bid.

06:17.290 --> 06:22.770
That makes it so that per hour prices are much higher than fixed price projects.

06:23.570 --> 06:28.910
Another big disadvantage with paying per hour is that sometimes you don't know whether or not they're

06:28.910 --> 06:35.060
being honest in how much they're charging you unless you have something set up like an oDesk team room

06:35.240 --> 06:37.120
or Elance work room.

06:37.130 --> 06:43.580
It's very hard to say what is worth four hours of work and how much of that time was spent working and

06:43.580 --> 06:46.210
how much time was spent not working.

06:46.310 --> 06:50.680
You open the opportunity for someone to be a little frivolous with their billing.

06:50.720 --> 06:56.470
I've known a lot of contractors who are otherwise reputable to take their invoices and add 20 percent

06:56.470 --> 06:57.560
regardless.

06:58.010 --> 07:04.010
Getting into an argument with a developer over what should have taken eight hours or four hours or 12

07:04.010 --> 07:06.830
hours that is not an argument you want to have.

07:06.890 --> 07:11.570
You honestly are just not in a good position to say how productive that person should be.

07:11.570 --> 07:13.930
It's way too complex.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.880
So how do I get around this.

07:15.890 --> 07:20.810
I've come up with a solution that I think works quite well and I strongly suggest you do it too.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.890
I do a hybrid.

07:22.960 --> 07:28.420
I ask the contractor upfront to tell me not the project price but how many hours they think it'll take

07:28.420 --> 07:29.560
them to do.

07:29.860 --> 07:34.780
And then once I have the hours that's roughly equivalent of what I'd see in a fixed cost price I'd then

07:34.780 --> 07:37.030
negotiate their rates slightly lower.

07:37.030 --> 07:43.660
So if they say it can take me a hundred hours and I want $15 an hour what I can say is OK I'll prove

07:43.660 --> 07:46.040
it at thirty five dollars an hour.

07:46.250 --> 07:51.380
Again kind of takes in the advantage of being able to leverage this project against them once they see

07:51.380 --> 07:53.930
that you've approved a large portion of ours.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.230
Chances are they're going to say yes regardless of what the actual rate ends up being.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.390
You don't necessarily have to haggle them.

07:59.390 --> 08:03.020
Sometimes you will lose a freelancer by doing this but the most.

08:03.020 --> 08:07.290
More often than not they will stick with you and you'll take a significant discount.

08:07.340 --> 08:12.460
Now after the 100 hours has expired when I start to do is I'd do everything piecemeal.

08:12.470 --> 08:15.430
So I say I want to add this section to it now.

08:15.470 --> 08:20.150
How long will that take you in terms of hours and then what they'll do is they'll pitch it back to me

08:20.150 --> 08:21.170
in hours.

08:21.290 --> 08:24.290
And so I'll say I want to add this feature and they'll say oh that's an easy one.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.850
That will take me three hours.

08:26.150 --> 08:31.170
And they know that three hours is in this case time thirty.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.150
So it's $105.

08:33.290 --> 08:37.740
And so they know that they have to keep the per hours low otherwise it's not going to get approved.

08:37.850 --> 08:42.470
And that's how I prevent people from running up the hours so if I said add this small feature and they

08:42.470 --> 08:45.490
just said 10 hours it should be six.

08:45.500 --> 08:50.010
They know that there's a chance it won't get approved and I will argue with them and I might say oh

08:50.020 --> 08:52.760
OK that's too complicated is there any way you can make it simpler.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.300
And virtually every time they can find a way of reducing it by 20 30 percent doing it incrementally

08:59.300 --> 09:04.430
like that makes it such that the freelancer knows they have to be honest about the price and it makes

09:04.430 --> 09:07.000
it much harder for them to inflate the numbers.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.600
It also makes it much harder for the numbers to run away from you because if I prove 100 hours I know

09:11.600 --> 09:17.090
exactly what that cost then I know how much is left to my budget and then I start approving all Eckhardt

09:17.210 --> 09:22.820
sections saying OK four hours here eight hours here 10 hours here and that's how I reach the remainder

09:22.820 --> 09:23.550
of my budget.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.330
That's how I keep the freelancer engaged and honest.
