WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:12.950
So now we've gotten to the point where we've created as many functions as we had in the job posting.

00:12.990 --> 00:18.850
Now if you're looking at this and you think this is complete Oh it is not complete in the slightest.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.200
There's a lot of things you need to ask yourself.

00:21.240 --> 00:32.890
So really basic questions that a lot of people miss are how does someone log out can they log out that's

00:32.890 --> 00:34.610
something that people always seem to forget about.

00:34.610 --> 00:38.100
You have to have some kind of account management.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.740
So for instance what happens if a user forgets their password.

00:42.740 --> 00:48.320
Since we're using Facebook logon for this example that's not a great example because everyone knows

00:48.320 --> 00:49.340
their password.

00:49.340 --> 00:53.610
But if you are using e-mail logons How do you reset your email.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.260
What if they forget their email or password.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.360
A lot of people also forget when they say log in with e-mail address.

01:02.360 --> 01:09.010
OK that's nice but at the same time you have to then say they have to have a registration screen.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.520
How do they register.

01:10.610 --> 01:13.420
And on the registration screen what's on it.

01:13.430 --> 01:16.960
I mean do we have a caption that makes sure that they're not a robot.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.870
Do we have in-depth information about them.

01:20.870 --> 01:23.900
Do we ask their birth date do we to validate their birthday.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.820
Do we need to validate their e-mail address.

01:25.820 --> 01:30.680
Do we need to send them one of those e-mails to verify that this is in fact their e-mail address.

01:30.860 --> 01:33.560
These are all things that you need to think of.

01:33.590 --> 01:38.630
And since we are all so used to using the Internet and using applications to do things we don't think

01:38.630 --> 01:39.710
about very often.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.780
But these are things that you just keep in mind to make sure that you're not missing.

01:43.880 --> 01:49.260
This one is one of the most common that I always see people forget and we get estimates here at Sprint.

01:49.550 --> 01:52.160
I would say 90 percent of people forget this.

01:52.190 --> 02:03.200
What do you as an administrator need to be able to do with the app app information.

02:03.230 --> 02:04.650
Now what do I mean by that.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.290
You have users.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.910
How do you handle these users.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.510
How do you know how many users you have.

02:11.510 --> 02:17.190
How do you delete users that are being abusive or spamming your system.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.960
How do you fix errors that if there's an error that pops up in your application.

02:23.330 --> 02:29.630
These are all things that you should consider and consider ways of not only remedying them but you also

02:29.630 --> 02:35.810
need to think of all of the things as you as a business manager might need to do or might need to fix

02:36.050 --> 02:38.060
or might need to accommodate.

02:38.060 --> 02:45.940
Now this is what I'm referring to when I say what's an admin panel what goes on my admin panel the admin

02:46.010 --> 02:53.600
panel is typically the page that the site owner or the app owner will go to to not only check the health

02:53.600 --> 03:02.480
of their application but to do basic tasks delete users change information for users update users be

03:02.480 --> 03:07.910
able to monitor how many messages they're going through how many matches have been made.

03:07.910 --> 03:13.960
These are all internal statistics for you as a business owner or product manager.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.570
So I would summarize it as.

03:15.590 --> 03:21.750
What do you as the manager need to be able to do.

03:23.520 --> 03:30.010
Now keep in mind having an Administration panel adds a lot of kind of heft to the estimate.

03:30.010 --> 03:34.840
So if you need something really simple make sure that is really simple but it's just really important

03:34.840 --> 03:40.720
that you do think about what you need and you make sure that you're not accidentally leaving something

03:40.750 --> 03:41.430
out.

03:41.710 --> 03:46.750
So if you're still kind of wondering what exactly an Administration panel is if you guys have ever used

03:46.760 --> 03:54.550
WordPress when you log into WordPress to create pages or add images or change information that's an

03:54.550 --> 03:55.670
Administration panel.

03:55.690 --> 03:55.890
OK.

03:55.900 --> 04:01.100
And so now we've been reminded about the Administration panel we might want to add that as a function

04:01.360 --> 04:13.320
so be able to see total number of users in the system able to delete users.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.810
So we'll keep that simple that's relatively simple.

04:16.870 --> 04:23.620
You could even go so far as to say need to have password or authentication in order to log in to my

04:23.650 --> 04:27.910
Administration panel because you don't want people accidentally accessing it and then screwing with

04:27.910 --> 04:28.480
your system.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.730
But you want to keep it simple just keep it simple.

04:32.400 --> 04:32.720
OK.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.780
Now what if.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.310
Now we need to think about this.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.720
Now that I'm someone who's in this application I put in all my information.

04:39.790 --> 04:44.490
OK so now I see four to five matches per day I'm logged in the application.

04:44.500 --> 04:49.810
Now what we need to make sure that we're not forgetting about all the functions that happen after that

04:49.810 --> 04:50.410
fact.

04:50.410 --> 04:53.200
How do I message them how do I view them.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.300
Do they have a profile page.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.090
I really don't.

04:56.200 --> 04:56.800
I don't know.

04:56.800 --> 05:01.320
So it's up to you to kind of determine what exactly would happen after this point.

05:01.540 --> 05:12.500
I could say clicking on a user shows me a page of page displaying there.

05:12.660 --> 05:20.880
Say their questionnaire answers questionnaire answers and their photo.

05:21.110 --> 05:21.900
OK.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.820
Now here's one thing with photos.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.470
How do you view the photos it literally just on your screen what happens to be clicked the photo.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.300
Can I see a zoomed in version.

05:29.300 --> 05:29.710
OK.

05:29.740 --> 05:43.140
That might be logical to think that clicking on profile photo will zoom in and display it display it

05:43.670 --> 05:44.750
a light box.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.180
OK.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.980
If you're not familiar with the light boxes of light boxes when you're looking at an image it displays

05:49.980 --> 05:55.470
the image from the forefront above the page or the app or whatever you're using and then it fades out

05:55.470 --> 05:56.470
the background.

05:56.640 --> 06:01.580
That's what a lightbox is it kind of is like that theater view that you have on YouTube.

06:02.180 --> 06:02.550
OK.

06:02.580 --> 06:10.290
So now we probably need to include something along the lines of messaging something along the lines

06:10.290 --> 06:12.960
of something you might entice them to message the other person.

06:12.970 --> 06:26.760
We could say something like answers to each question of plus or minus icons next to icons really.

06:26.880 --> 06:35.580
Whether or not it the user's preferences are similar.

06:35.580 --> 06:38.360
Now you might need to be able to define this a little bit more.

06:38.370 --> 06:44.260
A good developer will read this and ask you specifically do I get a plus if it's an 8 and an 8.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.620
Or do I get a plus if it's a 6 and 8.

06:46.620 --> 06:47.430
How does that work.

06:47.430 --> 06:49.040
What are the boundaries.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.660
You could easily display.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.540
Explain that.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.670
I don't really need to get into it but make sure that you do at least give a sentence about it say maybe

06:56.970 --> 07:02.290
as long as their answer is within three plus or minus you get a positive if it's not it's a minus.

07:02.310 --> 07:02.590
OK.

07:02.590 --> 07:07.830
The last thing we want to do is be able to message the person and let's just be lazy we'll just say

07:08.340 --> 07:16.350
clicking the message is the same always and and

07:20.310 --> 07:22.850
OK so here's what's going to happen.

07:22.860 --> 07:27.210
It's a little sketchy but I'm just making this up as we go so well as to say there's a message button

07:27.210 --> 07:31.890
on the person's profile if they like them they want to contact him at message it populates the text

07:31.890 --> 07:35.940
message in a pre-filled message and that message is always going to be the same except that it's going

07:35.940 --> 07:43.950
to use the original user's name so it'll say David was viewing your profile and is interested or David

07:43.950 --> 07:46.070
says hi or something along those lines.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.870
You would probably want to specify those out.

07:49.740 --> 07:55.560
Now here I might own as display something like the phone number never displays.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.910
It's actually a randomized phone number.

07:58.020 --> 08:02.430
And here's my essay that I want to use and as a mass tool to handle this there's a lot of different

08:02.430 --> 08:03.720
things you can say.

08:04.020 --> 08:09.190
But the point is that you want to list off as much as you possibly can.

08:09.360 --> 08:16.380
OK so we've just on the first go at this I just kind of went through the user and I tried to just list

08:16.380 --> 08:19.460
off everything I could think of that they'd run into as they went through.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.250
It's a very simple application.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.780
There's some things that I always see that I've left off right.

08:23.910 --> 08:25.290
Uploading a profile photo.

08:25.290 --> 08:29.160
How does that work exactly when I upload a profile photo does it resize it.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.170
Do they have to crop the photo.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.250
Where did they get the photo from.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.810
Can they pull a photo from the Internet.

08:33.810 --> 08:35.970
Can they pull it off their phone.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.520
Can they get it from their Facebook.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.200
There's a lot of different ways you can do that.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.180
Never underestimate the power of details.

08:44.400 --> 08:50.070
Never get to a point where you think OK I've completely left everything out because there's always something

08:50.070 --> 08:51.630
you might have left out.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.450
OK so this is a pretty good example of what your function sheet should look like if you guys have any

08:57.450 --> 09:01.260
trouble writing this function section or the scope section.

09:01.260 --> 09:05.310
Just let me know and send me a message or put it in the group discussion.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.600
Longer is better.

09:07.890 --> 09:12.540
And I think also though as you start writing this out you might realize that a lot of these you don't

09:12.540 --> 09:13.710
actually need.

09:13.710 --> 09:18.540
And so it's always good to go back and do some cleaning and get rid of the things you think are superfluous

09:18.540 --> 09:20.280
and might just jack up the price.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.340
So focus on being as comprehensive as possible.

09:23.340 --> 09:29.460
Don't forget basic mistakes like how do you log in log out how to access and basic information about

09:29.460 --> 09:34.090
myself you know things like Do we have a Terms of Agreement and a privacy policy.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.870
How do they contacted an administrator if there's a problem.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.540
How do they contact me.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.540
Does that link to my Web site.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.680
Do I have an Administration panel.

09:42.690 --> 09:45.900
What happens if they forget their e-mail and their password.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.730
What exactly do I need to control.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.950
How do I handle images things like that.

09:51.960 --> 09:57.930
There are a lot of things that are very mundane that you just might run into that you just never thought

09:57.930 --> 10:03.000
of and I always do suggest opening up an application someone else's application and going through it

10:03.270 --> 10:06.550
and just taking a mental note of everything that you run into.

10:06.660 --> 10:10.170
There's a lot of these things that fade into the background like intermediate screens.

10:10.180 --> 10:15.310
Do we have loading screens do we have explanation screens we welcome screens things like that.

10:15.780 --> 10:20.760
OK guys like I said if you need help with any of this stuff post just post in the group discussion.

10:20.760 --> 10:28.310
Now we're going to move onto the pages section.
