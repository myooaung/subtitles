WEBVTT

00:05.490 --> 00:06.190
OK.

00:06.190 --> 00:12.590
And now I want to show you an example of someone who didn't even really stay on topic at all.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.090
Here's one called exceptional technologies.

00:16.530 --> 00:21.180
Interesting how they went with the casual question or casual introduction.

00:21.210 --> 00:25.980
They pretty much stay on topic for maybe one section.

00:26.190 --> 00:31.560
Yeah it looks like they're saying that oh we've attached an RFP that's a request for a proposal and

00:31.560 --> 00:36.540
they say right here you know you're messaging it doesn't actually require messaging and cries GPS location

00:36.540 --> 00:39.330
it doesn't require US location work shift management.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.370
That is true.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.770
Web based back end yes this is true in bits and pieces.

00:43.770 --> 00:49.230
I don't know what that means but then right here you'll just notice immediately none of this has anything

00:49.230 --> 00:53.770
to do with the project you're trying to get me on Skype to talk to me.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.530
It has nothing do with my project.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.450
Looking at your video testimonials.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.740
Nothing to do with my project.

00:58.740 --> 01:02.600
Giving me a PTF a direct contact details your customer nothing nothing nothing.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.520
So pretty much all of this right here probably is just copy and pasted this right here probably was

01:08.520 --> 01:09.600
written by someone.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.280
This was copy and paste it.

01:11.710 --> 01:17.380
OK so these are good examples of a range you will expect.

01:17.640 --> 01:23.640
You know this person is 100 percent custom 100 percent everything they're saying has to do with your

01:23.640 --> 01:25.040
project that's a good thing.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.450
This guy is right in the middle.

01:26.550 --> 01:30.730
And this is a good example of a team that just did a very poor job.

01:30.750 --> 01:36.760
You can tell that they clearly missed some of the features and the majority of it is copy and paste

01:36.760 --> 01:37.560
it.

01:37.620 --> 01:41.730
You also notice some weak points right here they said they attach an RFP they didn't actually attach

01:41.730 --> 01:42.010
an R.

01:42.010 --> 01:42.650
P.

01:42.930 --> 01:48.250
Ok so now that you've looked at the ratio of copied and pasted information to custom information there

01:48.250 --> 01:51.140
are some other things that you can look for.

01:51.150 --> 01:55.720
One thing I like to look for is how well they construct their sentences.

01:55.890 --> 02:01.700
We can go back to screenies example here very very poorly constructed.

02:01.770 --> 02:08.130
I talked previously about camelback and you'll notice that that really just means that they're randomly

02:08.130 --> 02:15.360
capitalizing things is just a sign that they're not particularly good at English or they're not particularly

02:15.360 --> 02:16.840
good at communication.

02:16.860 --> 02:21.430
Typically I like to look at the way that sentences are constructed and a lot of people think like oh

02:21.440 --> 02:27.900
OK well you're going to give a massive disadvantage to a company that doesn't speak native English and

02:27.900 --> 02:30.090
that is somewhat true and somewhat not true.

02:30.090 --> 02:34.380
I mean you have to keep in mind that a lot of these estimates are going to come from countries that

02:34.650 --> 02:37.920
don't speak perfect English which is perfectly fine.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.450
But you have to also be aware of the fact that some of them can speak English better and some of them

02:42.450 --> 02:43.220
are worse.

02:43.260 --> 02:47.270
And this is going to be reflected in how well you can communicate with them.

02:47.280 --> 02:47.610
Sure.

02:47.640 --> 02:53.250
You might think this is cosmetic details like for instance if they accidently capitalize things but

02:53.400 --> 02:56.430
when you are communicating with them and something goes wrong.

02:56.700 --> 03:00.300
Any tiny little misunderstanding can become a problem.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.350
It can slow your project down and it can cost you money.

03:03.360 --> 03:09.120
So I always suggest looking over people's messages look for sections where they describe something that

03:09.120 --> 03:15.210
you don't understand what they mean or where they get off the point or where they tell you things that

03:15.270 --> 03:16.590
are just not important.

03:16.590 --> 03:21.220
These are all good indications of later on when you're working with them.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.950
How helpful are they going to be.

03:22.950 --> 03:24.880
How easy are they going to be to communicate with.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.120
So we can just literally take any example on here.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.770
You know this is an example of an Indian firm it's probably in the middle.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.710
Their communication skills are ok not terrible not great.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.440
We'll just take this paragraph for right here.

03:38.440 --> 03:45.600
We're a team of professional developers who hold expertise in open source development projects and double

03:45.600 --> 03:50.280
space can certainly help you figure out the best possible development approach after having discussion

03:50.280 --> 03:50.790
with you.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.380
Nothing terrible right here.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.850
I'm not sure what this double space was maybe.

03:54.930 --> 03:59.380
I think it's ticky tack but you'll notice that like this is a massive run on sentence.

03:59.730 --> 04:03.930
We do agree in agile application development practices.

04:03.930 --> 04:10.530
I don't know if that means they like it or they actually do it and then they say and hence have implanted

04:10.530 --> 04:16.710
processes that enables us to enables us deliver cost effective and timely projects.

04:16.710 --> 04:21.750
Ok so what you can tell here is you can get the gist of what they're saying but you'll notice that it's

04:21.750 --> 04:26.630
also kind of confusing and they might be using incorrect vocabulary in the future.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.660
That could be confusing especially to someone who's new to this project.

04:29.700 --> 04:34.650
That means you might be spending a lot of time kind of clearing yourself through the bushes and trying

04:34.650 --> 04:37.450
to figure out what exactly they are talking about.

04:37.530 --> 04:44.910
So and here is an example of a bid from ideal I.T. techno Private Limited if anybody's worked in India.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.280
This is something that almost all Indian companies do.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.780
They always have private limited bill and all these different attachments to the end of their thing

04:52.170 --> 04:56.280
and then it's almost as if they just use an adjective generator for their name or are they just stuck

04:56.280 --> 04:57.580
a bunch of things together.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.950
They don't even realize what techno means.

05:00.030 --> 05:03.880
The rest of the world they think it's a cool way of abbreviating technology.

05:04.260 --> 05:10.680
Anyway so here's an example of one that not only has poor communication but pretty much scores poorly

05:10.690 --> 05:17.250
on all of the things that I'm telling you to look for in terms of staying on topic right here.

05:17.880 --> 05:22.080
We are an I.T. firm really having a good track of developers.

05:22.080 --> 05:27.210
What is a good track of developers working in Android iPhone you know Photoshop blah blah blah blah

05:27.210 --> 05:27.640
blah.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.830
None of this has anything to do with are talking about.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.820
Didn't mention Twilio didn't mention S.M. mass.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.910
What does each team have to do anything.

05:35.910 --> 05:38.520
We're not building an iPhone app.

05:38.550 --> 05:41.080
Photoshop What does that have to do with anything.

05:41.340 --> 05:45.240
Right off the bat they just literally copy and pasted nonsense.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.940
Now how well can you understand them.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.070
Here's a here's a paragraph you should read.

05:50.070 --> 05:53.580
We have undergone with the description of assuming that just means.

05:53.700 --> 06:02.090
Read it under God in a process of understanding it given in your project details for Android iPhone

06:02.100 --> 06:03.070
taxi.

06:03.220 --> 06:07.170
OK it's a mobile application that sends text messages.

06:07.170 --> 06:10.290
It has nothing to do with iPhone or Android platforms.

06:10.290 --> 06:16.550
It's supposed to work on literally any project to manage drivers Caml backing.

06:16.590 --> 06:19.780
We will give you live I am chat with app.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.620
I don't even know what that means.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.910
So users can chat frequently.

06:23.910 --> 06:30.050
Also we will implement push notifications to notify on specific time with message.

06:30.210 --> 06:32.400
That is all just jibberish.

06:32.400 --> 06:39.420
I don't think that they're talking about how we had asked for the ability to send messages to drivers

06:39.420 --> 06:44.220
through the system but drivers shouldn't be communicating with themselves and they wouldn't be doing

06:44.220 --> 06:45.850
it through the administration panel.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.550
Neither would we.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.780
So they don't even know what that is.

06:50.820 --> 06:57.690
So here's a good example of you can see their communication skills right off the bat when in doubt throw

06:57.690 --> 06:58.080
it out.

06:58.080 --> 07:02.370
That's a great example great kind of credo to follow when you're looking at proposals.

07:02.370 --> 07:08.010
If you can't understand their well thought out proposal then you're not going to understand them when

07:08.010 --> 07:12.720
something goes wrong and you're not going to understand them when you have to change requirements and

07:12.720 --> 07:13.960
they ask question.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.870
So one other thing that I want to talk about.

07:16.890 --> 07:24.270
You should look for is how well in their proposal do they demonstrate that they understand what you're

07:24.270 --> 07:25.350
building.

07:25.350 --> 07:28.750
OK so I'll give you a good example and a bad example.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.080
A good example would be.

07:31.090 --> 07:34.230
Here's an example of a person who actually ended up working with.

07:34.230 --> 07:38.320
So the person introduces themselves and they say that you know they'd be happy to make it.

07:38.580 --> 07:44.070
They right off the bat said we've created critter's small demo of your functionality you requested they

07:44.070 --> 07:49.200
explain a problem that they had but they clearly understand that these are issues and then get around

07:49.200 --> 07:51.000
it right off the bat.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.890
This person just kind of got it right like they understood that we wanted estimated out in sections.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.180
This is one of our screener questions.

08:00.260 --> 08:06.240
Have you noticed this that I think only three of the 18 actually figured this out and gave us an estimate

08:06.240 --> 08:09.210
in three sections so he got that correct.

08:09.210 --> 08:11.630
Everything on here is custom.

08:11.670 --> 08:16.980
There's no copy and paste and information and they just built a version of it right off the bat just

08:16.980 --> 08:20.530
to prove that they knew what it was supposed to do and what it should do.

08:20.850 --> 08:22.480
That's a great thing.

08:22.740 --> 08:30.180
And as you can see here they created a system pretty much on their own so that's usually a great thing

08:30.180 --> 08:33.670
you can tell that you know they brought up some issues.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.810
They built a small version of it.

08:35.820 --> 08:39.720
They clearly thought about what they're trying to build.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.030
They've read the entire thing.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.990
They know that it's going to be in sections.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.390
This is a very very good proposal.

08:45.390 --> 08:51.020
Now an example of a bad proposal will go back down to our friends at ideal Tecno.

08:51.090 --> 08:54.410
They clearly do not understand what this project is about.

08:54.750 --> 08:58.630
So that's the last thing you want to look for is how well do they understand what it's about.

08:58.830 --> 09:02.760
We've already talked a little bit about this paragraph that shows that they clearly do not understand

09:02.760 --> 09:08.470
the messaging requirements in the messaging space specifications for this application.

09:08.660 --> 09:13.180
But you can also just notice that pretty much all of this is just garble.

09:13.350 --> 09:19.020
We are having expertise with server side apps with Android iPhone apps plus ph B web admin my secret

09:19.020 --> 09:19.960
database.

09:20.370 --> 09:22.380
OK that's fine.

09:22.380 --> 09:26.060
Again it's not an Android iPhone app I don't know why they thought that.

09:26.120 --> 09:33.150
What does it matter where you build the Administration panel and direct information with developer interaction

09:33.150 --> 09:34.710
with developers on Skype.

09:34.710 --> 09:39.570
If this is any indication of how they communicate I cannot imagine that being able to communicate directly

09:39.570 --> 09:41.300
with their developers is helpful.

09:41.460 --> 09:46.680
And then they give us a link to all these apps that have nothing to do with what we're trying to build.

09:47.160 --> 09:52.410
So this obviously is just a bad bad bad proposal.

09:52.410 --> 09:57.930
They score poorly on every single thing but relevancy is what we're talking about right this moment

09:58.230 --> 10:04.480
and relevancy understand showing that they understand what it is very poor we have expertise with location

10:04.480 --> 10:05.590
based apps.

10:05.650 --> 10:07.760
This is not a location based app.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.510
So look for these red flags.

10:09.520 --> 10:17.290
Honestly if they are incorrectly labeling the app if they're using overly generic information or terms

10:17.290 --> 10:25.150
to describe it if they are not using custom tacks they might be afraid of describing it correctly and

10:25.150 --> 10:28.280
it might be the case that they don't actually know what they're building.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.030
These are all things you should look for.

10:30.190 --> 10:33.370
So these guys clearly don't know what they're building Nic up here.

10:33.370 --> 10:34.590
Clearly it does.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.680
You can tell pretty quickly just from reading a couple of paragraphs that some of the other people that

10:38.680 --> 10:40.570
they do actually know what it is.

10:45.620 --> 10:50.340
OK so those are three things that I think you should look for when going over the language.

10:50.340 --> 10:53.890
Don't obviously set too a strict rule.

10:53.890 --> 10:57.280
Make sure that you know only if you don't have a lot of proposals then you need to be a little bit more

10:57.280 --> 10:57.780
lax.

10:57.780 --> 11:04.990
You've a lot of proposals you can be very picky but pay attention to things like how much message fatigue

11:04.990 --> 11:06.550
are they signaling to you.

11:06.550 --> 11:10.510
That means that they're busy they're building over the place and they haven't thought about your project

11:10.510 --> 11:13.690
a lot they haven't thought about your project that could mean that they're going to be problems in the

11:13.690 --> 11:18.030
future look for their ability or inability to communicate.

11:18.250 --> 11:22.360
If you think that they have bad communication skills now but they'll improve once you're working on

11:22.360 --> 11:24.770
a project you are sadly mistaken.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.900
They are going to be worse when you're working on a project.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.660
And the other thing that you should look for is how well do they demonstrate that they understand your

11:31.660 --> 11:32.310
application.

11:32.320 --> 11:38.200
If they build you a small version of it that is fantastic because they can just show you and even even

11:38.200 --> 11:41.770
highlighting issues that they might have or problems they might see.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.760
Those are all good things.

11:43.810 --> 11:48.220
And then on the other side if you have people using incorrect language describing it as something that

11:48.220 --> 11:53.280
it's not talking about sections that don't exist that's a very bad thing.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.890
That's that's a red flag you should literally throw this one out.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.290
Don't even read the price.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.230
It's not worth looking at.

11:59.290 --> 12:03.430
The last thing I want to leave you with that you should look for another red flag is if you look for

12:03.430 --> 12:05.620
people who are trying to get you off the platform.

12:05.710 --> 12:12.590
It's funny we had a previous lecture on getting you should use a strategy to get them off of the platform.

12:12.700 --> 12:17.120
But if they are trying to get you off the platform that is actually a negative sign.

12:17.140 --> 12:21.490
It means that they don't want to spend time on your proposal and they think that if you connect with

12:21.490 --> 12:26.890
them on Skype then they can use that as a prequalification technique to see that you're interested then

12:26.890 --> 12:28.350
they're going to dedicate time to it.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.250
That's not what you want.

12:29.250 --> 12:29.610
That's it.

12:29.620 --> 12:32.720
It's just a very cheap trick that a lot of freelancers use.

12:32.740 --> 12:39.160
They also think that if to get you off Skype you off the platform they can change the terms or say things

12:39.160 --> 12:41.710
that they wouldn't be allowed to say on here.

12:41.710 --> 12:49.310
So if you notice people doing that you can quite literally just look for control and go for Skype.

12:49.350 --> 12:53.760
So right here this guy wants me to share his Skype ID with him.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.620
We have this is actually IDEAL I.T. techno.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.430
They want us to get on skype very quickly.

12:58.600 --> 13:04.570
Here's acception air wants me to get on Skype for a quick introduction and they all immediately want

13:04.570 --> 13:06.650
me to connect with them.

13:06.790 --> 13:08.900
You know it you'll notice this very quickly.

13:08.940 --> 13:10.620
Nick did not do that.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.540
And even up here Paul Matthews did.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.910
He looks like he wants me to get on skype.

13:17.170 --> 13:20.110
And here we go we can discuss more on Skype.

13:20.110 --> 13:21.730
That's generally a bad thing.

13:21.730 --> 13:23.170
Try to avoid that.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.980
Try to get them on here.

13:27.010 --> 13:29.100
And if they want you get on skype.

13:29.110 --> 13:34.810
Keep that as a red flag in the back of your mind but you're more than capable of handling them if you

13:34.810 --> 13:36.450
ask them to get on Skype.

13:36.850 --> 13:37.270
OK.

13:37.330 --> 13:43.690
In the next lecture we're going to talk about response rate or how that is important and what you should

13:44.080 --> 13:48.490
think about that and how you should use that as a way to judge your proposals.

13:48.490 --> 13:54.430
All right so in the next lecture.
