WEBVTT

00:06.090 --> 00:13.580
What's talk about what is a reasonable budget for when you're trying to launch year in the year first

00:13.580 --> 00:21.680
a version through contracting first thing I want to say is it is not very expensive and if it were the

00:21.680 --> 00:28.930
case that web apps especially mobile apps were extremely expensive then I would not be making this course.

00:28.960 --> 00:35.110
I think that a lot of people are under the impression that apps if done well are extremely expensive.

00:35.110 --> 00:36.600
That is just not the case.

00:36.820 --> 00:44.140
You can take that from me and running a web studio for over almost three years now and it made me 120

00:44.140 --> 00:48.670
hundred thirty applications it's just not nearly as expensive as you think.

00:49.740 --> 00:55.170
In my experience as an entrepreneur I've run the gamut in terms of how much money I've spent on contracting

00:55.630 --> 01:00.350
I'd gotten deployable apps out in into market for as little as $200.

01:00.360 --> 01:08.550
I've built apps that seem like large applications that you know I only spent $1000 $2000 on to give

01:08.550 --> 01:12.920
you an example of the most recent personal software project that I did.

01:13.020 --> 01:21.330
I actually had built software that tracks taxis and manages the check in process and use for taxis that

01:21.480 --> 01:23.370
was essentially an Administration panel.

01:23.430 --> 01:31.470
And what it did was it would allow it allowed all the drivers to check in online with a visual schedule.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.150
They can click and choose and drop and swap shifts.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.050
It's integrated Twilley you know if you're not familiar with Twilley Toyo's a system that allows you

01:40.050 --> 01:43.710
to send text messages from your web application.

01:43.820 --> 01:49.220
It use Twilley to do check so every time the taxi driver ditching their car they would check an answer

01:49.230 --> 01:52.710
a bunch of questions the application would store it and present that information.

01:52.710 --> 01:57.600
It could calculate late fees based on when they checked in they could do things like expense tracking

01:57.870 --> 02:04.140
kept track of how much was spent on gas and how much was spent on carwashes and it used an automatic

02:04.140 --> 02:05.000
keyword system.

02:05.010 --> 02:11.280
So as opposed to having taxis call and the dispatcher may have problems they can just text into the

02:11.280 --> 02:16.830
application and based on the keywords the system could respond with instructions or pass that information

02:16.860 --> 02:20.720
on to another person who could actually respond to it.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.250
Now that would sound like a big application.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.420
Nope it actually wasn't.

02:24.420 --> 02:28.500
I spent about $3500 on that entire thing.

02:28.500 --> 02:32.570
That took about 10 days to build and I use a native English speaker.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.020
I didn't have to take this to India.

02:34.050 --> 02:38.930
I didn't have to send this to South America or Eastern Europe or someone in England.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.040
And it was barely over a thousand years.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.840
I mean I could have launched a more basic version of it for 800 $700.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.940
So there's a lot of functionality involved in that example.

02:49.350 --> 02:52.150
And it really is not something that has to break the bank.

02:52.950 --> 02:57.990
Now if you're going out and getting quotes what you're trying to build and it looks like you're about

02:57.990 --> 03:02.440
to spend what you'd spend on a luxury car you are doing something wrong.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.000
It's not the case that you have to spend that much money to build your application.

03:06.990 --> 03:12.440
It very rarely is if it is the case you're probably doing one of two things.

03:12.440 --> 03:18.440
One you're asking a studio and a studio has overhead and they charge a premium and they have their own

03:18.440 --> 03:20.350
marketing budgets and everything like that.

03:20.570 --> 03:23.190
You're using a studio that's charging you a lot of money.

03:23.210 --> 03:27.440
It's also probably the case that they're located here in the United States and so you're not actually

03:27.440 --> 03:30.840
taking advantage of the cost efficiencies of contracting when you do this.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.190
They're charging you probably roughly what you'd pay an in-house developer.

03:34.190 --> 03:41.820
That's bad you're also probably layering on way too many features at first when you launch your product

03:42.030 --> 03:48.060
you want to launch with the core of what you think can deliver the effectively what the value of your

03:48.060 --> 03:50.170
application to the consumer is.

03:51.130 --> 03:56.280
You basically need to identify what the number one number two things that these apps are going to do

03:56.290 --> 04:01.450
and build those first you do not need to launch with 20 25 features.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.620
Actually I think in a lot of cases that's a very bad thing to do because you don't realize what your

04:05.620 --> 04:09.340
customers want or your users want until you push it out there.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.590
And so once you push it out there you will see what they want.

04:11.590 --> 04:15.580
They'll demand other things and it might be the case that they end up rejecting a lot of the features

04:15.580 --> 04:22.990
you've built if you're spending $20000 $40000 you're probably launching with something that's just too

04:22.990 --> 04:23.810
large.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.620
If you guys follow any of like Eric he's in the lean startup.

04:28.650 --> 04:32.730
One of the things to talk about a lot is just minimizing how much money you have to spend upfront before

04:32.730 --> 04:34.860
you figure out whether or not something works.

04:34.890 --> 04:41.250
Follow that model per build an MVP minimally viable product try to launch the smallest thing you possibly

04:41.250 --> 04:44.710
can if it's costing you tons and tons of money to get out get it out the door.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.770
You probably have too many features.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.230
If you can afford to launch it for tons and tons of money then power to you.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.600
But just be aware you're taking a risk and this might be the most effective way of spending your money.

04:57.950 --> 05:03.770
I think the most effective way of giving you a nice idea of how much things typically cost is just to

05:03.800 --> 05:10.190
give you some examples and through examples you can get an idea of what raises the cost to what lowers

05:10.190 --> 05:16.510
the cost and what is a dollar value to associate with a small app in a medium size app in a large.

05:16.610 --> 05:23.660
Let's start with the example number one let's say you want to build a Chrome extension app because you're

05:23.660 --> 05:24.520
not familiar.

05:24.590 --> 05:29.260
You open up Google Chrome the Web browser the top right there is the Options button.

05:29.360 --> 05:35.860
And next in that you can go to the Chrome store and you can install plugins that affect your browser.

05:36.030 --> 05:44.090
Say you wanted that app to make actions on your web browser based on the behavior of the web browser.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.590
Let's get a little bit more specific.

05:45.660 --> 05:50.700
Let's say you wanted to build an app that reminds you to get back to work every time you go to a certain

05:50.970 --> 05:54.870
like say 20 25 websites from building that app.

05:54.870 --> 05:58.230
Getting it in the App Store Xining little icon for it.

05:58.260 --> 06:02.270
I think a realistic price for that would be about $400.

06:02.470 --> 06:06.480
You could get it done for a thousand and you could probably get it done for two hundred but I think

06:06.510 --> 06:09.760
you might be cutting too many corners if you're going that low.

06:09.780 --> 06:17.160
Now if you wanted to add in the ability to have settings on the system and add Web sites on the fly

06:17.370 --> 06:22.190
you might need to add in an extra $200 that's a decent example.

06:22.230 --> 06:27.570
That is a broad generalization as different every single time you ask a contractor because different

06:27.570 --> 06:33.340
contractors have different rates different contractors work at certain speeds versus other people.

06:33.390 --> 06:36.610
It's also depends if he has a fixed rate versus a price per hour.

06:36.630 --> 06:41.730
That's something we're going to talk about later in the course so let's use an example number two.

06:41.770 --> 06:43.380
This one is going to be a web app.

06:43.420 --> 06:50.590
This web app allow you to log in through Facebook display on a wall all of your friends and their upcoming

06:50.590 --> 06:56.830
birthdays then allow you to select a friend add notes to them about what you want to buy them for their

06:56.830 --> 07:06.190
birthday and then have a system that can send you e-mail reminders and could possibly even in the e-mail

07:06.190 --> 07:11.330
reminders populate some of the key words you used in your notes to give you Amazon suggestions.

07:12.200 --> 07:19.250
That one hi would assume you could get built for anywhere from a thousand to 2000 dollars.

07:19.250 --> 07:23.960
Again you can go above and below that then you're either paying way too much or you're cutting too many

07:23.960 --> 07:25.070
corners.

07:25.070 --> 07:30.620
The reason why this one's a little bit more complicated is because you now have to use Facebook logon

07:30.920 --> 07:32.620
which means you have to integrate Facebook.

07:32.900 --> 07:38.360
You need to handle user IDs and user accounts which means they have to log in log out.

07:38.480 --> 07:44.060
Probably going have to add account settings and also has to do some pretty heavy manipulation from the

07:44.060 --> 07:48.260
Facebook data and also e-mail notifications email notifications.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.320
That's another day of work for a freelancer.

07:50.330 --> 07:55.820
But it is a day of work e-mail notifications are generally simpler than say text message notifications

07:55.820 --> 07:57.740
or push notifications on an app.

07:57.740 --> 08:01.580
But it is something that they would have to spend a day building and integrating Amazon.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.750
Maybe that's another half day.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.120
So I'd say about a thousand or two thousand dollars.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.200
Now if you wanted to make this more polished You could definitely add some more features and now would

08:10.200 --> 08:14.280
probably add a couple of more thousand dollars depending on what it was if you wanted to make this responsive

08:14.580 --> 08:20.910
responsive meaning that the website would respond to whatever screen resolution is opening it would

08:20.940 --> 08:26.080
automatically add just the Web site's dimensions to fit my iPad or my iPhone.

08:26.170 --> 08:30.300
Yeah you could probably add another $1500 to it because what you have to do is go back and design an

08:30.300 --> 08:35.070
entirely new layout and that's going to depend a lot on the graphic design that you use.

08:35.070 --> 08:40.950
That project right there the core of it one to $2000 you earlier wanted to polish it out make it responsive

08:40.950 --> 08:43.270
and sharpen iPads and iPhones flawlessly.

08:43.320 --> 08:47.740
You could spend easily three $4000.

08:47.760 --> 08:54.970
There are certain things out there that will raise the price of your project significantly.

08:55.170 --> 09:00.260
And this is where we get to the point where your project costs more than say $5000.

09:00.420 --> 09:05.490
Is your project multi-platform multi-platform meaning if you're building a mobile app doesn't need to

09:05.490 --> 09:08.970
be on iPhone Android Windows phone and BlackBerry.

09:08.970 --> 09:16.800
A good rule of thumb is that take the cost for building it on one application and then add 60 to 70

09:16.800 --> 09:18.770
percent to build it on a second one.

09:18.780 --> 09:22.920
And so if you're doing that four times you would need to make that calculation four different times.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.170
Obviously depends on a lot of different variables.

09:25.170 --> 09:31.140
I'm just speaking in general terms if I were to take an application and build it on an iPhone you would

09:31.140 --> 09:36.660
have to design the front of the application for the iPhone and a server application that could handle

09:36.660 --> 09:42.450
the data well the server application can be used in Android can be used in Windows Phone.

09:42.450 --> 09:47.460
And that's what allows you to have some savings you're not doing the project effectively four times.

09:47.490 --> 09:51.450
And if it's a case that you want to launch multi-platform like that that's where I think you need to

09:51.450 --> 09:56.610
set down and have a hard think about whether or not it's smart to launch a basic project on multiple

09:56.610 --> 09:59.220
platforms at once when it's just you.

09:59.370 --> 10:05.610
It's generally a better idea to launch with one and less the entire value proposition of your application

10:05.670 --> 10:09.210
is that it is multi-platform in which case you're just going to have to know you're gonna be spending

10:09.210 --> 10:10.620
more money.

10:10.620 --> 10:11.870
Another thing I look for.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.440
Are you building something that's never been done before.

10:14.790 --> 10:20.220
Really all that means is that this is something that the freelancer or the contractor or the studio

10:20.370 --> 10:26.520
they're going to have to do a lot of time researching and if has a really hard thing to do they could

10:26.520 --> 10:31.570
spend five hours researching it for every one hour they actually spent implementing it.

10:31.620 --> 10:35.310
And so that's going to drive up the cost and that's something that you need to know that if you're building

10:35.310 --> 10:40.380
something you've never seen before or since it's not very common it's going to get significantly more

10:40.380 --> 10:41.200
expensive.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.560
This was just a little taste of what I'm talking about when I say something.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.780
Contracting is cheap.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.370
Getting your first version out is cheap.

10:50.370 --> 10:52.680
I think everyone's experience is going to be different.

10:52.710 --> 10:57.420
It just depends what you're comfortable launching with and if you are again launching with something

10:57.420 --> 11:00.880
that cost over $10000 or $8000.

11:01.110 --> 11:05.310
Please do take some time to reassess whether or not these features are absolutely necessary.

11:05.310 --> 11:09.590
I don't want you to go and spend a ton of money upfront and get burned realizing half what you built

11:09.620 --> 11:10.670
isn't necessary.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.340
Is it useful and isn't being accepted by your users.

11:14.430 --> 11:18.060
You guys have any questions posted of the group discussion or private message me.

11:18.060 --> 11:25.310
If you guys are looking for estimates for cost on your applications I would say please hold off on that.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.580
The reason why I'm saying this is because later in the course we're going to talk about how you will

11:29.580 --> 11:35.220
find a contractor and how you can effectively gauge what the price is when you go out and actually do

11:35.220 --> 11:36.090
this for real.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.390
It's going to get you the most accurate price.

11:38.430 --> 11:42.690
And it's kind of you're wasting time by asking for quotes from someone else.

11:42.810 --> 11:48.630
Even if you are going around shopping around to studios based on your idea just know that right now

11:48.630 --> 11:52.530
until you actually get out there and you follow the rest of the steps in the course you're not going

11:52.530 --> 11:57.630
to get a very accurate representation with the prices so have a little patience and just hold off just

11:57.630 --> 12:00.360
for a second but have any other questions regarding this lecture.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.970
Just let me know and we can talk about it.
