00:05.660 --> 00:12.070
A little bit about the concept of what good is and how that applies to outsource labor.

00:12.330 --> 00:17.870
This is a concept that really helped me when I started to wrap my head around it.

00:18.060 --> 00:25.020
When I first started outsourcing it was very difficult as I noticed there were big differences between

00:25.080 --> 00:29.830
what the outsourced labor would say is good and what I considered good.

00:30.270 --> 00:35.060
At first I thought it was just this huge disconnect I just assumed that they were bad at what they did.

00:35.640 --> 00:40.830
But actually what ended up happening was I kind of came to a little bit of a revelation and ever since

00:40.830 --> 00:46.320
it's really helped me know what level of communication that I should engage with with mine contractors.

00:46.320 --> 00:51.510
And for you the listener This is a side anecdote but I think it's something that is essential to you

00:51.540 --> 00:55.130
understanding the perspective of the people that you hire.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.330
So this really only applies to when you're hiring someone from a country that is cheaper in terms of

01:00.330 --> 01:06.480
labor rates and that usually will mean that the country is significantly poorer than say a developed

01:06.480 --> 01:08.200
country or G-20.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.020
If you've never been to the country that you're hiring from whether it's you know Eastern Europe or

01:13.020 --> 01:19.110
specifically India or even you know Central America this is something that's very hard for you to understand

01:19.110 --> 01:25.150
because you assume we all use the same websites you assume that we all use the same design standards.

01:25.260 --> 01:30.960
You kind of assume that what I think is beautiful is what they think is beautiful and they even Obviously

01:30.960 --> 01:35.220
there's differences between countries that are right next to each other and have the same kind of socio

01:35.240 --> 01:37.200
economic level.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.410
Let's say that you hire a freelancer from India.

01:40.410 --> 01:48.840
You're thrilled because you have huge cost savings but you might have followed a less rigid schedule

01:48.840 --> 01:52.320
when developing the specifications for your application.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.870
You might have erred on the side of I think that the developer can interpret what I'm saying and I don't

01:57.870 --> 02:00.510
need to give every little bit of detail.

02:00.660 --> 02:07.140
I don't need to say what style of button he should use and what color palette and what kind of interaction

02:07.140 --> 02:09.840
should happen when I touch things on the Web site.

02:09.930 --> 02:14.400
You kind of assume that all of that comes in tow that they just know that right.

02:15.220 --> 02:18.850
That is a false assumption when it comes to an outsourced developer.

02:18.880 --> 02:25.630
A lot of them simply either one do not understand what it is that you want or do they understand what

02:25.630 --> 02:26.650
they think is good.

02:26.650 --> 02:32.830
And so they're going to strive to achieve a Web site or a design that they consider good.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.510
Now here's where the biggest discrepancy is if you've ever been to India.

02:37.570 --> 02:42.910
And I did end up living there for quite some time and I got to use India as an example because this

02:42.910 --> 02:45.150
is the I.T. outsourcing hub.

02:45.160 --> 02:50.530
It's by far the biggest group when it comes to outsourcing and when you go and you start looking for

02:50.530 --> 02:55.780
freelancers you probably noticed you know 40 50 percent of them are from India India Bangladesh even

02:55.780 --> 02:56.830
Sri Lanka.

02:57.340 --> 03:00.180
But if you ever go to India you will just notice that.

03:00.370 --> 03:02.470
And it's not necessarily the country itself.

03:02.470 --> 03:09.790
But if you just look at say a Web site or a billboard or a basic advertisement to you it just looks

03:09.790 --> 03:16.110
physically unappealing it looks like a design standard that to us was used in the 90s.

03:16.150 --> 03:21.940
I'm going to bring up a couple Web sites on the screen that you can see if you just go and look at say

03:21.940 --> 03:28.600
in the top 10 Web sites you can notice what they consider a top 10 Web site and then look at the design

03:28.600 --> 03:29.700
standard.

03:29.710 --> 03:35.660
And you'll notice that their design standard by what we consider good that's what I would call subpar.

03:35.710 --> 03:43.450
They have designs that you would associate with the old version of e-bay or very flat basic design they

03:43.500 --> 03:46.360
can pull up a logo here this logo.

03:46.360 --> 03:52.180
As you notice it has that and gloss candied effect with a gradient that runs to the top.

03:52.300 --> 03:57.640
That was a design standard in the United States back in like right around when the iPhone was coming

03:57.640 --> 04:00.150
out like 2006 2007.

04:00.310 --> 04:09.220
We'd like to Candy everything since 2010 or 11 that stopped being considered by the general US population

04:09.250 --> 04:10.510
as a good design standard.

04:10.510 --> 04:17.110
And so we moved on then we moved on to like what we Apple would call skew morphic designs.

04:17.110 --> 04:22.060
Remember the old iOS Apple with the buttons that look like they're almost 3-D in a sense they look like

04:22.060 --> 04:25.200
they're actually physically there and in sense with iOS 8.

04:25.240 --> 04:31.200
We've moved on to flat basic design and we're now shifting towards flat is beautiful.

04:32.530 --> 04:35.870
So you know I kind of described how the trends are in the United States.

04:35.920 --> 04:41.830
Other countries have different trends but specifically in India are trends just typically a lag behind

04:41.830 --> 04:42.850
the United States.

04:42.880 --> 04:48.190
And so if you live in India and you're constantly consuming all of this advertisement consuming all

04:48.190 --> 04:54.160
these Web sites mobile apps and they're on a different design standard when you naturally intuitively

04:54.160 --> 04:59.710
think of what is good and when you're making an application and you don't have directions as to how

04:59.710 --> 05:04.300
to make something work or make something look you're going to default to or try to achieve what you

05:04.300 --> 05:05.900
consider to be good.

05:06.070 --> 05:08.850
Now good is very relative.

05:08.860 --> 05:14.500
And that is where the biggest disconnect I've ever experience with outsourced labor is they don't understand

05:14.500 --> 05:19.030
what your level of good is and they're good for us is terrible.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.530
You know you could see these examples I brought up these are just normal things that you see on an everyday

05:23.530 --> 05:24.150
basis.

05:24.160 --> 05:32.170
And again to us ugly to them totally normal it this is not to say that they don't have beautiful advertisements

05:32.170 --> 05:37.770
so they don't have beautiful Web sites clear trip is a great example of an Indian airline booking website

05:37.780 --> 05:43.060
that's fantastic but then it links you to the airlines in India and their Web sites are just horrible.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.330
Look look front page from the 1990s.

05:45.850 --> 05:50.620
You need to keep this in mind when you are writing your specifications and when you're communicating

05:50.620 --> 05:54.310
with the developer do not assume they know what you want.

05:54.460 --> 06:01.840
Be as specific as possible especially be specific when it comes to things like the design and things

06:01.840 --> 06:04.350
like what type of javascript you should use.

06:04.360 --> 06:10.180
Now when I say design I mean show them a Web site and say I like the design from this.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.230
I want it to look like this.

06:12.490 --> 06:17.740
Ideally show them two or three if they don't know how to recreate that they can use some place that

06:17.740 --> 06:19.330
kind of copying techniques.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.610
The point is you're setting a baseline for them.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.640
They just know the end of the day.

06:23.770 --> 06:25.250
This is what it should look like.

06:25.450 --> 06:29.580
And that's going to allow them to make improvisations on the spot.

06:31.020 --> 06:35.070
And then what do I mean by what type of javascript you should be using.

06:35.070 --> 06:37.380
I mean what interactions you should use.

06:37.380 --> 06:42.240
Go to a Web site and focus solely on what happens when you click things.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.310
What happens when you load pages.

06:44.310 --> 06:50.600
There are all sorts of intermediate pages that you just are not aware of because you're used to it.

06:50.730 --> 06:57.110
Like for instance if you look at the lecture I'm doing on e Lance when I go and load my dashboard.

06:57.180 --> 07:02.950
Typically an Indian Web site will just leave it blank and then have something show up once it's loaded.

07:02.970 --> 07:09.990
Elance is going to show a spinning loader so I can know that unexpecting content to come in right now

07:09.990 --> 07:11.430
it's not ready to load.

07:11.430 --> 07:19.790
That's an intermediate page is what I essentially call it interaction things that move you need to be

07:19.790 --> 07:22.490
as specific as possible.

07:22.490 --> 07:27.610
The way that you can kind of avoid this good trap is through documentation.

07:27.680 --> 07:33.110
And when you work with your graphic designer sketch out all of the pages you want to design and then

07:33.110 --> 07:38.600
design an extra 50 percent Design intermediate pages design what a list looks like when it doesn't come

07:38.600 --> 07:45.260
up with something design with the 404 page looks like design everything that could possibly happen every

07:45.260 --> 07:53.270
different color that could happen that when you're like highlighting taxed try to think of every single

07:53.270 --> 07:54.800
instance and design that.

07:54.830 --> 07:59.810
And that way when you use outsource labor you don't have to rely on them to determine in their head

07:59.810 --> 08:01.150
what good is.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.500
They can just follow your directions but then make sure that they have an example Web site showing what

08:06.500 --> 08:12.290
you consider good quality so that they can look at those and then refer back to them in times when they're

08:12.410 --> 08:13.260
in doubt.

08:13.730 --> 08:20.630
If you want to get deeper into this go to Lexa dotcom site rankings and just look at some of the common

08:20.780 --> 08:26.340
countries that you outsource to and then look at the Web sites that are in the top 10 typically top

08:26.340 --> 08:26.860
10.

08:26.870 --> 08:30.650
You know obviously you have are the big ones like Google and Facebook but look at the ones that are

08:30.650 --> 08:32.260
very specific to that area.

08:32.330 --> 08:38.300
Look at the bank Web sites look at the airline Web sites Nagin start to get an idea of what they consider

08:38.300 --> 08:40.570
beautiful in terms of web design standards.

08:40.760 --> 08:46.220
And this will just give you an idea that there actually is a very big gap between what I'm talking about

08:46.220 --> 08:53.010
when I say good and what they think when they say good the way that you avoid this trap is you communicate

08:53.010 --> 08:53.550
more.

08:53.550 --> 08:59.280
You add more detail to your specifications and you cover as many bases as you can with the terms of

08:59.280 --> 09:01.650
screen design when you're working with their graphic design.
