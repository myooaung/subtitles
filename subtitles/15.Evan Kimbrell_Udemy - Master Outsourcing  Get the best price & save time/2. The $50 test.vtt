So you might be thinking that the criteria that we went over in a previous lecture about how to pick

00:11.570 --> 00:17.450
a good freelancer you might think that that is not bulletproof and you might still have a little bit

00:17.450 --> 00:24.020
of anxiety around picking someone and giving are growing a large amount of money and you're not even

00:24.020 --> 00:26.790
sure whether or not they're going to be able to produce what you want.

00:27.780 --> 00:31.890
At first I say go off of those five criteria I had said before.

00:31.980 --> 00:33.930
That's never going to let you down.

00:33.930 --> 00:38.630
But there is one way that you can take this validation to the next step.

00:38.850 --> 00:43.920
I call this the $50 test because it cost about $50 or $100.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.090
It's a very small amount of money.

00:46.110 --> 00:51.430
Now what you want to do and this is a tactic that's worked for me many many many times.

00:51.480 --> 00:57.990
This is actually how I've developed some of my longest lasting contractor relationships is once you've

00:57.990 --> 01:03.030
whittled down your list down to a very short list maybe you're talking two or three people or firms

01:03.360 --> 01:11.160
try taking off a very small side task and assigning it to them and then paying them for it.

01:11.160 --> 01:17.670
Now the whole idea behind this is you just want to validate how they actually operate.

01:17.670 --> 01:22.890
Once you are a client now a lot of people are really good at pitching themselves and selling themselves

01:22.890 --> 01:28.950
and they aren't really flashy portfolios but you can never be 100 percent sure until you actually work

01:28.950 --> 01:29.990
with them.

01:30.030 --> 01:36.210
Now if you just pick something really simple I suggest once you've picked your graphic design what you

01:36.210 --> 01:41.250
can do is you can take that graphic design and in a lot of cases it's just going to an image like a

01:41.250 --> 01:47.610
photoshop file or if you bought a template and you have an h tim file what you can do is you can assign

01:47.610 --> 01:48.900
them a very small task.

01:48.900 --> 01:54.530
So if it's a Photoshop files just an image tell them that you want this to be converted into HD amounts.

01:54.540 --> 02:01.640
SS That is a relatively cheap task that shouldn't cost you a ton of money.

02:01.860 --> 02:07.230
And if you have an HVM template send it to them and say I want to change something about it try to change

02:07.230 --> 02:07.830
something.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.630
Really anything.

02:09.630 --> 02:14.840
Say you know changing the width of something or changing the look around something.

02:14.880 --> 02:21.390
The point is is that once you give them a small piece to work with and then you can see how well you

02:21.390 --> 02:23.440
actually operate together.

02:23.520 --> 02:31.180
Whenever I do this almost invariably 50 percent of the people I give this tiny little $100 $50 test

02:31.180 --> 02:36.410
to they end up just failing all of a sudden the responsiveness changes all of us and I notice that there's

02:36.420 --> 02:42.960
a much larger gap in our communication than I thought before a lot and all of a sudden I find out that

02:43.230 --> 02:48.690
they don't really have the same design sensibilities that I previously thought they had or what was

02:48.690 --> 02:51.210
implied by looking at their portfolios.

02:51.690 --> 02:56.610
So in short give them the ultimate test if you're not sure if you want to work with them or you have

02:56.610 --> 03:01.090
a bunch of freelancers that you rate them all kind of equally and you don't know which way to go.

03:01.170 --> 03:03.770
Try tearing off a tiny little bit of work.

03:03.780 --> 03:06.210
Give it to them and then see how they operate.

03:06.210 --> 03:11.620
I guarantee you one of them will stick out way above the other ones and I'll make a decision.

03:11.670 --> 03:13.290
So much easier.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.410
$50 or $100.

03:15.420 --> 03:21.030
It's not a lot of money when you consider how much money you could be spending on this person.

03:21.120 --> 03:27.300
And also think about whether or not your application actually takes off gets a lot of users gets lots

03:27.300 --> 03:28.160
of attention.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.880
You're going to want this developer to be in it for the long haul in case you need them.

03:33.030 --> 03:39.240
And so you're going to kick yourself in the head if you don't do a really simple validation trick and

03:39.240 --> 03:43.400
later down the line you find out this person is a lot more flaky than you thought.

03:43.400 --> 03:51.420
You find out that they are not nearly as good at design or understanding what good web development standards

03:51.420 --> 03:52.200
are.

03:52.560 --> 03:57.180
You know there's a lot of different red flags that will come down later and you just want to make sure

03:57.180 --> 04:10.990
that it's not too late when you notice them and this is hands down the best tactic I've ever used.
