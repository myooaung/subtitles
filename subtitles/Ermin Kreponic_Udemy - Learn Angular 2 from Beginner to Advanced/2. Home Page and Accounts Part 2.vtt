WEBVTT

00:00.370 --> 00:04.550
OK so let's go ahead and continue.

00:04.650 --> 00:10.880
The first thing it will need to do is well I've created a new file here but we're going to get to that.

00:10.950 --> 00:15.820
But the first thing we need to do is go to the index dot h DML.

00:15.870 --> 00:20.610
So let me just go ahead and find it.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.430
There we go.

00:21.780 --> 00:27.600
And here are going to go ahead and type in the following.

00:27.800 --> 00:32.910
So base page ref equals

00:35.570 --> 00:36.840
slash.

00:37.030 --> 00:37.810
OK.

00:37.860 --> 00:44.400
So this represents the root of our application to beginning the root the starting point and we're going

00:44.400 --> 00:46.650
to place that here.

00:46.800 --> 00:55.230
Now please go ahead and make a file out routes that TS with in the app folder.

00:55.230 --> 01:01.140
And here we're going to have all these beautiful lines of code.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.400
Let me just go over them quickly.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.750
So first of all we are importing a few things here.

01:07.770 --> 01:15.960
The rotary config this is a list of wraps route's is based around is basically an object which determines

01:16.050 --> 01:25.320
which content will be served along with the specified you are able to imports down below.

01:25.310 --> 01:29.220
Well this is the home component and this is the account component.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.870
Now provide a router.

01:30.900 --> 01:34.290
This is tied to this function here.

01:34.410 --> 01:41.790
This basically returns all the needed services and we have created an array here where we shall store

01:41.940 --> 01:49.680
those services so it returns all the needed services and disarray will contain a list of services the

01:49.680 --> 02:00.110
main service will be the router service which will be configured to our routes and these are our routes.

02:00.110 --> 02:07.730
So this is the syntax for the route so when we are creating some sort of an array here and we are listing

02:07.820 --> 02:11.070
one route after another sort of.

02:11.240 --> 02:17.390
So we have a path and then we have we just type in path and then we type in the route.

02:17.690 --> 02:27.480
And then we specify which component would be like to use and here the first route is basically the route

02:27.530 --> 02:32.660
the beginning the base you are well so you can type in as I've specified here like localhost and then

02:32.660 --> 02:38.150
the port or local host port and then a slash and down below.

02:38.540 --> 02:41.500
The second path is actually accounts.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.150
One key note here you cannot do this.

02:44.150 --> 02:46.810
So this is very bad for angular.

02:46.850 --> 02:51.380
You don't use slashes at the beginning you can use them later on here but you don't use them at the

02:51.380 --> 02:52.570
beginning.

02:53.330 --> 03:00.300
And this is going to be a local host call and 3000 and then slash accounts 3000 is the port.

03:00.410 --> 03:05.190
Anyway go ahead and create this file and have this code in it.

03:06.910 --> 03:11.070
Now then next up is the main dot ts.

03:11.200 --> 03:11.910
Let me just go ahead.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.270
Save this.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.340
Next up is the main ts.

03:16.350 --> 03:28.260
So here aside from all that's listed here we need to go ahead and create an additional imports so import

03:35.180 --> 03:39.830
router underlined fighters

03:45.250 --> 03:49.780
slush up that route.

03:49.800 --> 04:03.000
This is from the file that we basically just created and it's route wraps anyway and down below in Bootstrap

04:03.360 --> 04:16.170
we will go ahead and type in the following so we need to place a comma here and then to go into the

04:16.170 --> 04:18.160
next line.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.800
It's going to be like this app router providers

04:29.400 --> 04:34.560
and they block your apps.

04:34.590 --> 04:40.090
So app providers and then just close the block and that's it.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.620
So control us to save it.

04:42.690 --> 04:47.490
So we need to plug this plug or we just go out and showed it to you.

04:47.490 --> 04:50.310
Actually it's going to be simpler this way.

04:50.310 --> 04:56.640
So you have appro providers and this function basically returns all the needed services which are stored

04:56.640 --> 04:58.290
into this array.

04:58.320 --> 05:03.780
So when you go into the main tiers when you plug this array in here and specify that the entire application

05:03.780 --> 05:11.210
will be using it you will have all the needed services they're available.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.440
And this is where we actually plug it in.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.170
And this is where we actually create our routes.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.170
OK.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.680
So let's go to the app component.

05:23.880 --> 05:30.940
Extremal So app component that DML and here we are.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.960
We will need to basically just add a few things.

05:38.200 --> 05:47.280
So here should be their router outlet.

05:51.990 --> 05:58.260
Her outlet should be an auto complete but it's not completing.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.290
It's not out of completing for some strange reason.

06:01.530 --> 06:08.970
So this is the this is the component where the router will actually place the content depending on which

06:08.970 --> 06:10.130
route is active.

06:10.140 --> 06:14.880
So depending on the type of depending on where you are well what you type in that is the sort of content

06:14.910 --> 06:18.680
which will be placed here in between these two.

06:19.560 --> 06:24.960
OK so next up we're going to go into the app component dot D.S..

06:25.230 --> 06:28.800
And here we need to make a few modifications.

06:29.130 --> 06:32.430
So we need to create an additional import

06:35.250 --> 06:43.230
Browder when we will need to have directives so router up directives.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.990
This came from.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.570
This is something that's built into the angular.

06:48.930 --> 07:01.290
So at angular angler's router and UPS he had down below here.

07:03.200 --> 07:09.590
Directives going to go ahead and put the router

07:12.940 --> 07:13.760
ffs.

07:13.860 --> 07:14.390
OK.

07:14.430 --> 07:22.950
So control s to save now will go ahead and jump into the home component out actually.

07:23.220 --> 07:33.700
So home component that HD M-L and here will just need to make another smaller adjustment.

07:34.380 --> 07:39.930
So again at other heathery three we're going to do a

07:42.900 --> 07:43.530
router

07:46.320 --> 07:58.880
rudder link the Morgan State equals to all excluding the second counts

08:01.960 --> 08:10.040
this you like look at your accounts

08:12.280 --> 08:23.530
dot and let's go ahead and close this tag and let's go ahead and close the header tag as well.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.160
Sorry about that.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.070
My throat is getting a little bit dry.

08:26.200 --> 08:33.280
So this is basically an array and this array has this particular element slash cap.

08:33.310 --> 08:36.580
It's more elements can be passed.

08:36.580 --> 08:46.870
So this will be basically a cut slash account is the link parameter and this will be bound to the router

08:46.960 --> 08:49.180
link directive here.

08:49.270 --> 08:56.440
So this is one of the parameters that will be bound to the router Alling directive so we will definitely

08:56.530 --> 08:57.730
need this.

08:58.300 --> 09:04.210
And now we can go to the home component the directives themselves have been explained previously as

09:04.210 --> 09:04.820
well.

09:05.080 --> 09:11.530
So now we're going to go into the home component of TS and here we're going to mess around a little

09:11.530 --> 09:11.860
bit.

09:11.860 --> 09:15.290
Nothing too fancy so just two lines of code that we need to add.

09:15.490 --> 09:20.970
It's going to be import again again router

09:25.830 --> 09:27.580
what is this

09:31.530 --> 09:32.210
Rachel.

09:32.450 --> 09:38.570
So Rohter directives from

09:42.730 --> 09:45.290
angler's router

09:48.840 --> 09:52.910
underneath the templates will just do the same thing.

09:52.920 --> 09:58.630
Now we will plug in the directors and actors call them

10:01.520 --> 10:02.890
router directives.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.610
Thank you for the autocomplete.

10:04.610 --> 10:06.590
It has been most helpful.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.490
So that's all we really need to do.

10:08.540 --> 10:15.490
We don't actually need to do anything else just plug us plug a bunch of the same stuff in multiple places.

10:15.500 --> 10:25.120
Really that's pretty much all that we did here in order to allow for the separation of our Homeside

10:25.210 --> 10:28.290
lemming page and the accounts site.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.760
So we will proceed in the fullest Troil.
