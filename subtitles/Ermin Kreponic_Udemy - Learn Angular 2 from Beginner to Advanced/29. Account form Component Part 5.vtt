00:00.420 --> 00:05.620
Welcome back or so you're just going to go ahead and continue anyway.

00:05.820 --> 00:09.160
If I go back to the site let me just refresh it.

00:09.870 --> 00:11.470
I modified the code somewhat.

00:11.500 --> 00:17.720
And now if you type in the title and click on Create and again you get an error message.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.510
But this remains as it is the field is not reset.

00:21.510 --> 00:29.610
So the idea here what we are trying to achieve is to basically not reset the fields in case there is

00:29.610 --> 00:34.770
an error because for example if you have 10 fields which you need to populate which a user needs to

00:34.770 --> 00:42.840
populate let's say a user name and email address a password kept date of birth.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.680
Secret question whatever.

00:45.690 --> 00:51.090
Just imagine if he made a mistake somewhere with CAPTA for example and all the fields got reset.

00:51.090 --> 00:54.500
So he has to do it over and over and over and over again.

00:54.900 --> 01:02.570
And that's really bad because he has to sure he has to retype like 10 20 fields for no particular reason.

01:02.580 --> 01:08.730
So when you get an error message if the if the input failed Don't let's create some logic where the

01:08.730 --> 01:11.930
fields will not be reset.

01:12.120 --> 01:18.360
So your error message will tell you what the problem is and you can go down and fix only that segment

01:18.360 --> 01:21.020
and not the entire rewrite entire thing again.

01:21.510 --> 01:21.830
OK.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.750
So in order for us to achieve this we will switch the resetting of the fields to the parent component

01:27.810 --> 01:30.470
and make it dependent on the error.

01:30.480 --> 01:37.440
So if we get an error the fields will be reset if we don't get an error the fields will be re set.

01:38.790 --> 01:46.620
So the first thing that we need to do is go into the account form component at a table and add this

01:46.620 --> 01:52.640
here so hash for this is a reference to the form.

01:52.710 --> 02:00.290
So this is a form that is basically a local variable that is a reference to this for that is how we

02:00.290 --> 02:03.560
are referencing it and that's how we were accessing it.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.980
And everything that's in it.

02:07.040 --> 02:15.600
OK so next up is the account form component Darty as we just need to go into it and there are a few

02:15.600 --> 02:22.740
things here which we've included so you child and element ref the child is a directive that we use to

02:22.740 --> 02:31.990
basically fetch child components and the HDMI elements with in our component so element ref here.

02:32.010 --> 02:36.570
Well that's just that's basically a type which refers to the HDMI elements.

02:36.570 --> 02:37.930
We'll see what that does.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.210
A little bit later.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.260
And how it behaves.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.790
Basically we just need to have it there.

02:44.910 --> 02:51.440
I know I know it's a stupid explanation but let me just show you down below what I mean by it anyway.

02:51.470 --> 02:55.050
So we will need to delete this part here.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.200
And we just go back a few steps.

02:57.230 --> 03:02.290
So you had something like this and this was used in order to reset the field.

03:02.300 --> 03:06.800
But now we're going to go ahead and delete that and that will be gone.

03:07.420 --> 03:13.700
So they're no longer reset by default upon the attempt of creating a new account.

03:13.790 --> 03:22.040
Rather instead we're going to go ahead and create a public reset for them before I get into the public

03:22.040 --> 03:23.570
Reise public method.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.510
Reset for.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.510
Let me just go to explain this new trial.

03:26.660 --> 03:32.710
So this new child it here for him and this is referring to this year.

03:32.720 --> 03:42.780
The reference to this for here and then it says here for him and element ref Well this just needs to

03:42.780 --> 03:43.280
happen.

03:43.310 --> 03:49.170
This just needs to have Element reft we need to tell it what type it is and we don't really we're not

03:49.730 --> 03:55.420
it and we don't know but we can just place element reft there and be safe and not think about it at

03:55.430 --> 03:55.660
all.

03:55.650 --> 04:00.940
So for him needs to have a type here anyway view child as a decorator.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.180
The same as before.

04:02.220 --> 04:03.980
The same as input and output.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.350
Your child is just another decorator in the long line of them.

04:08.350 --> 04:14.900
Now Double-O it says public reset for him and says this dog for him does need development.

04:14.920 --> 04:22.750
The hard reset now reset is a built in method for resetting field for resetting the form fields.

04:23.370 --> 04:32.940
This art form is referring to the form is referring to the form up here and native element is well angular

04:33.000 --> 04:37.540
too doesn't allow direct editing of elements.

04:37.590 --> 04:42.110
So to say so we need to tell it like a native element and then reset it.

04:42.300 --> 04:49.860
This is a security precaution in place but it's fine to use it now it's not recommended but in our case

04:49.860 --> 04:51.790
we can use it here.

04:52.140 --> 04:57.540
Some other places perhaps it wouldn't be a recommendation but in our case it's completely fine.

04:59.450 --> 05:07.330
Anyway next up that we're going to do is go into the component dotted ts.

05:07.970 --> 05:11.440
So we just find it.

05:11.590 --> 05:15.850
Put dot TS come on.

05:16.070 --> 05:16.570
There we go.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.190
So app component dot does.

05:19.430 --> 05:28.970
Once again we've imported a few child here and if we scroll down it will see that we have at few trials

05:28.970 --> 05:29.850
here as well.

05:29.930 --> 05:35.570
But this part is a little bit different account for is our component and it is the class that we have

05:35.570 --> 05:42.830
imported so we have a for him that we have imported and you have it's exact location as well.

05:44.310 --> 05:51.340
And then it says for him again doing pretty much the same thing and then it says account form of type

05:51.340 --> 06:01.200
account form and you again have the to have it imported here account for and there is another line here.

06:01.290 --> 06:06.670
Another line of code which is actually in charge of resetting all of this.

06:06.930 --> 06:12.610
So you have a public reset form method here in the account form component.

06:12.660 --> 06:18.000
Yes but it is not called from the from the child component rather instead.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.040
It is called from the parent component to parent component is calling this form and we have made it

06:23.250 --> 06:26.460
public deliberately so that it can be called.

06:26.490 --> 06:30.870
So this part of the code is the same as before which has been explained in the prior chore in the previous

06:30.870 --> 06:31.720
Tauriel.

06:31.890 --> 06:35.900
And this here is basically this for Doc reset form.

06:35.910 --> 06:41.520
It calls the method from the child component so if we succeed in adding a new account then we would

06:41.520 --> 06:45.810
like to reset for the start form.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.120
Here are the start for.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.370
This is the child component and the method reset form basically belongs to the child component but it

06:53.370 --> 07:00.750
is called from the parent component here which means the parent component dictates when the fields of

07:00.810 --> 07:08.130
the form will actually be reset and this is the right way to do it because the parent component knows

07:08.220 --> 07:12.300
whether we have actually succeeded or not and if we have succeeded.

07:12.320 --> 07:17.750
OK reset the fields if we have not succeeded well don't preset the fields.

07:17.790 --> 07:18.510
Simple as that.

07:18.510 --> 07:23.830
Go into the else part and display the error message on the screen.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.270
Anyway that would be it here.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.110
Hi hope to see you in the follow up.
