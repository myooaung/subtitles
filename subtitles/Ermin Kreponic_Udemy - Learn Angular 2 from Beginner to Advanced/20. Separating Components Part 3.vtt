WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:00.760
OK.

00:00.840 --> 00:04.120
So let's wrap this up.

00:04.180 --> 00:08.900
Go into the app that component parties and modified iPads in accordance.

00:09.150 --> 00:15.430
So the very first modification that I made here actually made for testing it it's looks like this.

00:15.450 --> 00:23.910
But now we need to basically just type in a slash account so our folder count slash and then account

00:23.960 --> 00:27.340
Armato press control as the safe.

00:27.870 --> 00:28.230
OK.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.040
So that part is done.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.110
The next thing that we need to do is go down below and type in import

00:39.920 --> 00:49.310
count list from and we're going to need like Dot

00:53.710 --> 00:55.200
accounts

00:57.480 --> 01:01.700
with DOT COM component.

01:01.960 --> 01:02.350
OK.

01:02.350 --> 01:03.380
So there we go.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.500
And so Michael at the end.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.110
And I misspelled Is

01:11.880 --> 01:14.090
this right.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.230
Right right right right.

01:15.260 --> 01:16.460
Right.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.310
It's more than one.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.260
So it's like a house list.

01:20.590 --> 01:22.330
Anyway that's what you need to do there.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.250
I'll explain that in a bit.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.030
Actually let's go let's go right now.

01:26.410 --> 01:33.640
So a counselor you will find it appear we go export and its class accounts.

01:33.670 --> 01:43.520
So we are importing it and we are also stating where a component actually lies in which folder and we

01:43.520 --> 01:46.590
are importing that class.

01:46.670 --> 01:51.620
Now we will need one more thing here before we can actually go to our site and have it displayed.

01:51.680 --> 01:58.640
It's a directive so directives semi colon

02:01.240 --> 02:06.260
accounts list and control us.

02:07.020 --> 02:07.360
OK.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.520
So why do we need this line.

02:09.670 --> 02:17.260
Well it's basically a list of directives that we are going to be utilizing So in order for Engler we

02:17.260 --> 02:23.230
do know within its own template to look for other components like our account list that you saw a moment

02:23.230 --> 02:25.600
ago and we just show it to you.

02:26.690 --> 02:27.150
Here we go.

02:27.170 --> 02:31.340
So this is this is basically what we have.

02:31.340 --> 02:33.080
So it's a Caldas list.

02:33.230 --> 02:36.470
We have to list the directives here.

02:36.950 --> 02:43.820
So they have to be listed here in order to prevent collisions with other components directives that

02:43.820 --> 02:52.580
we might have so you could have tags of the same name etc. So we want to list the directives here in

02:52.580 --> 02:55.840
order to prevent any sort of collision but you don't need to know a lot about that.

02:55.850 --> 03:02.030
Now you will see as the project gets more and more complex How does this come to be useful because doesn't

03:02.030 --> 03:05.820
really seem that useful now anyway.

03:06.610 --> 03:15.700
So we are effectively telling the angular to look within its own template for other components with

03:15.700 --> 03:16.740
this like.

03:16.750 --> 03:24.850
So directives accounts list that's what we are instructing Engler to do now and you need to go into

03:24.850 --> 03:32.560
each one of these folders and just press controls save to make sure that they are all saved and that

03:32.560 --> 03:37.320
the changes have actually taken place every day that something is going to go through it.

03:37.330 --> 03:44.400
Now and just wait for the site to load waiting.

03:44.450 --> 03:44.900
Yes.

03:44.930 --> 03:45.520
Excellent.

03:45.710 --> 03:48.570
So you see it looks exactly the same.

03:48.590 --> 03:51.420
There are no differences here whatsoever.

03:51.440 --> 03:59.990
We've simply moved our our account list into a separate folder and it has a separate set of files and

03:59.990 --> 04:07.400
it has a separate component which we can recycle later on without any issues of whatsoever.

04:07.400 --> 04:14.190
Now let me just go ahead and explain another thing here which I really want to.

04:14.570 --> 04:23.600
So you have a counseling stack and we have created this tag in order to be able to insert the code from

04:23.600 --> 04:33.260
the accounts list component that HDMI so that we are able to insert this entire HD M-L code there.

04:33.480 --> 04:44.260
In order for us to achieve that we needed to go to the we need to go to the app component RTX and enable

04:44.280 --> 04:51.220
accounts directives accounts lists so we do that in order for us to be able to achieve that and we need

04:51.220 --> 04:51.770
to set.

04:51.810 --> 04:56.030
We needed to set a selector here which is accounts list.

04:56.130 --> 05:04.140
Once those two jobs have been done and complete we can successfully use the tags within the DML form

05:04.530 --> 05:07.910
in order to plug in the entirety of our original code.

05:08.220 --> 05:16.290
And it's much better this way because you have these tags and this entire code can be placed in the

05:16.290 --> 05:16.830
center.

05:16.890 --> 05:20.910
If you have a huge HDMI file like we're going to have it's going to be rather big.

05:20.910 --> 05:21.710
You don't want it.

05:21.750 --> 05:25.380
You don't want your entire HD Malco to be in a single file.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.550
It's very bad.

05:26.760 --> 05:31.290
You're not going to be able to go through that fast that it's going to be very difficult for you to

05:31.290 --> 05:33.400
troubleshoot or debug anything.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.630
So have these things have these tags.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.570
I've shown you how to create them how to plug them in and what it is that you need to do in order to

05:39.570 --> 05:40.790
make them functional.

05:41.740 --> 05:49.000
So place them here and set separate the HD Malko to see I have one HDMI file here which contains some

05:49.000 --> 05:53.620
of the HDMI code that is in direct relation to the accounts list.

05:53.620 --> 06:01.690
So that is going to be in the computer in the consulate component but down below I have my main main

06:01.720 --> 06:09.340
H.A. file where I'm just plugging in things that I have previously separated making the making my code

06:09.400 --> 06:13.650
a lot more readable and more convenient to go over anyway.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.340
That would be basically it.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.800
We don't have a lot else to do here.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.610
We have managed to conduct a successful separation.

06:20.860 --> 06:28.630
So in the fall of the two aerials we're going to be dealing with some input output and we will see we

06:28.630 --> 06:31.240
will build on.

06:31.330 --> 06:37.000
We will build on this further on the separation so we will continue going along this way so that we

06:37.000 --> 06:39.910
can have neat components one next to another.

06:39.910 --> 06:48.080
Each one is in charge of doing of performing its own set of functionalities with its own logic.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.180
So bid you farewell.
