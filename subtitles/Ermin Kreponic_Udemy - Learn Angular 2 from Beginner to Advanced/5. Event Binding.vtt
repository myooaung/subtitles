WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:02.780
OK so welcome back.

00:02.790 --> 00:07.800
This is going to be a pretty fast one so we're not going to do a lot of things here but we'll do something

00:07.800 --> 00:09.240
fairly cool and interesting.

00:09.240 --> 00:15.750
I would say in any case once again you will be able to find code either under the lectures or somewhere

00:15.750 --> 00:17.250
else you will be given instructions.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.710
In any case in the.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.970
Just go back to the instructions in the introduction and there I will state where you can actually find

00:24.030 --> 00:26.170
the code anyway.

00:26.550 --> 00:33.000
So once again we are in our component RTX So we're still doing some basic things but fairly soon we

00:33.000 --> 00:36.960
will actually start building our application before we go there.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.740
I wish to go over these things.

00:38.940 --> 00:47.400
So we have effectively trimmed down our app that can put in Dot TS and create user has remained the

00:47.400 --> 00:54.090
same hide email has remained the same interface user pretty much everything is the same except the basic

00:54.090 --> 00:57.290
one is the same but we have implemented this method here.

00:57.300 --> 01:05.390
It says private to go and it says start Heidi mail equals negate email hide e-mail.

01:05.460 --> 01:10.800
So whatever the current version of whatever the current value of Heidy meal is negated.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.010
So if it's true put it to false if it's false but it's true.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.670
So we're just negating it whatever it is re-integrating.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.030
That's what the exclamation mark here is for.

01:22.140 --> 01:28.170
Now that's all we need to do here just create this one small simple method and then we can go back to

01:28.170 --> 01:35.210
our HDL code which has also been trimmed down to a great extent as opposed to the previous versions.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.020
So we still have this part here.

01:38.040 --> 01:41.030
We are going to leave that as it is that has been explained previously.

01:41.040 --> 01:49.970
But down below we have button and we will add a button and we will perform event binding here.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.580
We will bind a click event to Tuggle method.

01:53.790 --> 02:02.400
So we have the toggle method in the component or TS which basically just sets the status of hide email

02:02.400 --> 02:05.910
save hide email is true and this phunk once this method is called.

02:05.910 --> 02:09.490
It will become false or if it's false it will become true.

02:09.510 --> 02:11.800
Once this method is called.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.590
So this is just the button.

02:13.680 --> 02:19.190
And we have an event which is click and we are binding it to this method here.

02:22.340 --> 02:26.860
When the Basically when the click event occurs we're going to call that function.

02:26.870 --> 02:31.860
But unlike property binding we will use parentheses here.

02:32.270 --> 02:35.680
So as you can see here you have to have blocks.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.750
And here you have parentheses.

02:38.420 --> 02:46.060
So entier the binding always goes from event to component.

02:46.070 --> 02:47.050
So from event.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.160
So from this event.

02:49.220 --> 02:59.200
Sorry not button but from this event here to the component so from left to right in our case here and

02:59.290 --> 03:03.720
once we click the button this is going to be called but down below we have this pretty much the same

03:03.730 --> 03:05.570
the two of these are pretty much the same.

03:05.860 --> 03:07.660
But this is basically Mousley.

03:07.660 --> 03:14.080
So when we go over this button and once the mouse leaves the button area this event will be called and

03:14.080 --> 03:20.310
hence this dysfunction this method will be called as well.

03:20.670 --> 03:27.820
So as we can bind any event in the email that is in existence in this fashion.

03:27.850 --> 03:34.340
And same goes for property binding if you wish to see the list of all the HD M-L events.

03:34.340 --> 03:39.020
Just just type in HDMI elements list and go onto the net and you will find a listing.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.190
I assure you.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.980
So let's see how this actually works.

03:43.030 --> 03:43.930
Let's see it in action.

03:43.930 --> 03:48.530
So just save both files before anything happens and make sure the server is running.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.370
So when I click on this you'll see it will hide it.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.560
And when I click again it will.

03:54.580 --> 03:54.890
OK.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.520
So the mouse sleeve is asking me up a little bit.

03:59.200 --> 03:59.540
OK.

03:59.550 --> 04:02.970
So now let's let's let's go over to go Mousley.

04:02.990 --> 04:06.560
So we are at the moment looking at what this line does.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.680
And whatever this line does will be reflected on to this line because this

04:14.690 --> 04:22.260
and this this property will actually is actually bound to hide email Boullion.

04:22.400 --> 04:28.520
And since this method actually changes the value of hide email Boullion this will in turn change as

04:28.520 --> 04:28.760
well.

04:28.760 --> 04:34.640
So whether this what their Heidi mail is true or false that has put this element will be dependent on

04:34.700 --> 04:37.610
that is whether it will be displayed or not.

04:37.610 --> 04:44.760
So if I go over Mousley and then my mouse actually leaves this area you will see the function is called.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.140
And then this is printed up.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.250
This is shown on the screen.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.790
If I do that again it goes away.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.910
Same goes for clicking if I click it shows if I click again it disappears.

04:54.030 --> 04:54.400
But

04:57.200 --> 04:58.540
OK.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.340
Oh my God.

05:03.440 --> 05:07.590
OK I can click fast enough because then the mouse happens as well.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.010
But let's go ahead and do this.

05:13.550 --> 05:16.950
And make this disappear just for a second.

05:20.290 --> 05:20.930
OK.

05:21.240 --> 05:21.490
OK.

05:21.490 --> 05:25.900
So if I click it shows if I click again it disappears.

05:25.900 --> 05:29.160
I'm sure that you've seen this on sites a lot of times.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.150
And by the way these are.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.720
These are HD M-O comments.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.150
This is how you would create a common block.

05:34.690 --> 05:36.480
So this is all that I want to show you here.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.820
And before I'm done I want you to play around with this.

05:38.830 --> 05:42.610
I want you to create all sorts of buttons that perform all sorts of actions.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.410
Go nuts.

05:43.420 --> 05:48.540
Do whatever you can to learn and have have fun doing it.

05:48.700 --> 05:53.980
But I think this is a pretty cool feature so I wanted to show it to you and I want to explain event

05:54.020 --> 05:55.410
binding through it.

05:55.450 --> 05:58.130
It's a bid you farewell and hope to see you in the follow up.
