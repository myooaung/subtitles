WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:01.900
Welcome back all.

00:01.920 --> 00:09.150
So I have added a few lines of code etc. as before you'll be able to find the code below the lectures

00:09.150 --> 00:11.220
or and get help or somewhere else.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.610
Just go back to the very first intro and dare I have listed it.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.710
I've explained that anyway.

00:18.720 --> 00:25.250
The Firfir I'm going to open up these files and edit them in the order of execution.

00:25.290 --> 00:30.300
So the very first thing that we need to take a look at is app component got HDMI out.

00:30.690 --> 00:35.440
This year is the only line which has been added to this file.

00:35.460 --> 00:41.910
Now this line will define how we would like to use the child component which is the account form as

00:41.910 --> 00:47.430
specified here as well you have the account form how we would like to use this trial component from

00:47.520 --> 00:49.140
the parent component.

00:49.140 --> 00:54.720
That sound because Linux updates informing me that I should update the system God knows how many I have

00:56.420 --> 01:06.850
anyway here created is an event and will and we will perform event binding when this event occurs.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.140
This method here.

01:08.150 --> 01:15.560
Create a calendar create A.S.C. is called in the parent component so the app component dot D.S.

01:19.040 --> 01:27.670
and we will pass the new account that was created as an event to this method.

01:28.830 --> 01:30.340
So that's how it goes.

01:30.390 --> 01:38.430
But since here it says Account form we will need to go to the account form God component at HD out.

01:38.970 --> 01:44.650
So here there is a button here for the Create up there is the create button.

01:44.900 --> 01:50.780
So when this create button is pressed because keep in mind even though this is app component not HD

01:50.810 --> 01:58.730
M-L you have a foreign tags here which means that the HD Malcomb HMO code from here will be inserted

01:58.730 --> 02:00.010
and executed there.

02:00.260 --> 02:09.440
So when a user clicks the create button here you will have the create a CC method that is going to be

02:09.800 --> 02:17.450
called now they create A.S.C. here and create A.S.C. here.

02:17.550 --> 02:20.060
They are not the same methods.

02:20.060 --> 02:25.100
They just have the same names can be confusing but there you have deliberately I have left the names

02:25.220 --> 02:27.810
same in a deliberate deliberately.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.270
Here's why.

02:29.420 --> 02:34.610
If you go into the account form that component you will see a lot of code here all explain it.

02:34.610 --> 02:36.690
But for now just take a look at this method here.

02:36.760 --> 02:44.260
It says create A.S.C. And if you go into the app component RTX you know.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.630
Yep there we go again Crecy create A.S.C..

02:47.690 --> 02:53.060
Now these two methods they have little to nothing with one another.

02:53.570 --> 03:01.430
So you don't have to really be concerned about that because you can have as many as many methods as

03:01.430 --> 03:05.600
you want and they can all have the same names in different components.

03:05.630 --> 03:08.800
They will not interfere with one another.

03:09.040 --> 03:09.460
OK.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.810
So we have went into the here.

03:14.820 --> 03:21.580
We've clicked the button and now we're going to go into the account form that component.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.810
P.S. Hopefully you have managed to write it partially.

03:27.010 --> 03:28.290
If yes that's great.

03:28.300 --> 03:32.440
If not oh well just take a look and see what happens.

03:32.440 --> 03:38.080
So first of all we have important component and we needed output and we needed a vent emitter.

03:38.080 --> 03:46.170
So same things as before with the account list and we have imported count as well from account datt

03:46.270 --> 03:49.760
model account model.

03:49.870 --> 03:50.670
You have it here.

03:50.710 --> 03:56.760
So you have the class account we have imported that as well as we would need to utilize this.

03:56.770 --> 04:05.830
We will need it going back now we have begun creating our components so the selector is accounted for.

04:05.930 --> 04:10.700
The selector is in direct relation with this tier.

04:10.750 --> 04:21.920
So the which we're getting a little bit last year so you have the selector account form here.

04:21.940 --> 04:25.190
So we need to go into account.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.210
A male and to account for.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.250
Yep there we go.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.470
So we have count forne selector here.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.110
For some strange reason I read accomplice that I got a little bit confused there.

04:37.190 --> 04:44.090
Anyway so one more time you have the selector which says account for that selector account for him is

04:44.180 --> 04:48.520
in direct relation with the HMO code here where it says accounted for.

04:48.530 --> 04:54.020
So we know what we are referring to let's go back to the Ts.

04:54.070 --> 04:59.900
So the template you are well that's basically an account and account for component out HD.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.700
So we are effectively utilizing the HD AML which we have created for this component styles.

05:05.740 --> 05:11.950
Again same thing we're using to see assess which we have previously created and now we would like to

05:11.980 --> 05:16.810
export A-class account for what the next four year class means.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.380
That's been explained at least two times by now.

05:19.370 --> 05:26.220
So I'm just going to go ahead and skip that and then we come to the output decorator.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.730
Now the decorators have next.

05:27.790 --> 05:35.810
We have had a separate chapter for decorator's but basically its purpose here is to provide logic's

05:36.020 --> 05:43.900
so that the parent component could perform event binding to the created and then it's basically the

05:43.900 --> 05:44.950
same as before.

05:44.980 --> 05:56.140
We are simply instantiating a new event emitter that we'll be able to emit data of a type account and

05:56.140 --> 05:58.990
says Here at output and then it says created here.

05:58.990 --> 06:06.130
And if you remember from before we used to type something stype in something like this here but there

06:06.130 --> 06:07.720
was no need.

06:07.720 --> 06:15.610
If you don't want any special names by default this name will be taken for the decorator and it says

06:15.630 --> 06:22.680
create it so it will be like created was written here and you have created here as well so they're fine.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.880
They're all interconnected intertwined.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.950
Utilizing one another.

06:28.020 --> 06:36.730
OK so now we come into the private method create accounts or create A.S.C..

06:36.930 --> 06:42.800
This is the create as you see this basically this method is in this component.

06:42.810 --> 06:45.090
It has nothing to do with the app component.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.790
That does create A.S.C. method.

06:47.820 --> 06:54.000
It's not to be confused as it is not the same it only has the same name as and as I have stated you

06:54.000 --> 06:54.830
are entitled.

06:54.870 --> 06:58.680
You are allowed to have the same names across different components.

07:00.790 --> 07:08.790
Keep in mind that this method create A.S.C. will be called from account underlined form data component

07:08.870 --> 07:09.930
that Egidia mail.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.670
So it will be called from here and here is the call.

07:13.690 --> 07:18.850
So create A.S.C. right here on click.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.450
It will be called.

07:21.470 --> 07:30.510
Now this method and its arguments are pretty much the same before the method receives DML.

07:30.540 --> 07:37.560
In patrolman's for title description and balance as you can see here.

07:37.610 --> 07:43.730
OK so let's go ahead and take a look at it a little bit more.

07:43.750 --> 07:49.840
So this account that first of all you have something here which might look a little bit strange It says

07:49.930 --> 07:53.990
var a new account and then semi-colon account.

07:54.010 --> 08:03.040
So this variable we are initializing to a new account that we are making first of all this it says var.

08:03.040 --> 08:13.010
So variable This is a account variable of type in new account and we're stating like equal and then

08:13.070 --> 08:16.730
we're create We're basically just

08:21.220 --> 08:25.730
we're taking we're taking the values from the DML elements.

08:25.810 --> 08:33.130
So it says like new account and then it says like title element and then value description L and then

08:33.610 --> 08:39.340
that value and then balance element in the dot value.

08:39.380 --> 08:48.790
So we are creating a new instance of it and we are taking these values from the DML elements and notice

08:48.910 --> 08:55.330
that we are fixing the ID number to the zero which is the first argument.

08:55.330 --> 08:59.570
This is very much different from before we're fixating on the ID to zero.

08:59.590 --> 09:00.570
Why are we doing this.

09:00.610 --> 09:07.480
Well we're doing this because the ID assignment is something that is supposed to be done on the server.

09:07.480 --> 09:13.810
In our case and we would not and we would not like this component to be involved in this process at

09:13.810 --> 09:14.680
all.

09:14.770 --> 09:19.960
We would not like it to be able to assign IDs so we're going to leave that for the parent component

09:19.960 --> 09:25.080
and we're just going to state zero here later on the parent component as the process continues.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.750
This will be changed.

09:28.030 --> 09:35.200
And down below it says this stuff created dot Amet We are basically emitting a variable new account

09:36.460 --> 09:40.120
as an event to all those that are subscribed.

09:40.150 --> 09:43.120
In our case the parent component is subscribed

09:46.040 --> 09:51.440
after that is done after we have admitted that we are resetting the field values.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.280
I apologize here.

09:52.280 --> 09:57.860
This is the variable new account of type accounts not the other way around.

09:57.860 --> 09:58.870
My sincere apologies for that.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.840
I don't know why I just wrote it rotated them around for some strange reason.

10:04.130 --> 10:04.450
Anyway.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.240
So you have a new account which has been.

10:08.240 --> 10:13.160
So you have a new account here and we have just specified the type of the new account.

10:13.340 --> 10:20.900
And then we have initialized the variable new account to these values.

10:20.910 --> 10:24.360
Now since we have initialized it to those values it contains those values.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.300
And now it is being emitted as an event to all those who are subscribed.

10:28.440 --> 10:33.490
They will receive these values and then we will simply reset field values.

10:33.690 --> 10:42.420
And now since our app since our parent component is actually subscribed as you can see Tessier are created

10:42.750 --> 10:45.760
and you have a list and you have a decorator which is also created.

10:45.850 --> 10:49.450
Therefore this parent component is actually subscribed.

10:49.590 --> 10:57.740
It will receive that event it will receive that event and that event will be passed to create a CC method

10:57.740 --> 10:58.330
here.

10:58.370 --> 11:02.810
So you see it receives an event and then once it receives an event.

11:02.850 --> 11:09.290
Now we are going to go ahead and call the Create the A.S.C. method which is in the app component Dottie's

11:09.640 --> 11:11.780
and you have it right here.

11:12.930 --> 11:15.330
So some other thing has been eliminated.

11:15.330 --> 11:17.720
We're no longer going to need this.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.690
So we can just go ahead and delete it.

11:21.290 --> 11:25.890
But then again you will have the source code available without any problems.

11:27.630 --> 11:32.050
My throat is bothering me a little bit so no big deal there anyway.

11:32.100 --> 11:41.890
So I have a private method here create HCC which will basically be called and it will start receiving.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.480
So there are a few more before.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.700
Well actually that explain it and then I'll explain the rest of the things that we've actually changed

11:47.700 --> 11:48.370
here.

11:48.390 --> 11:53.820
So this is the method which we are binding to the created event and will be called when the trial component

11:53.820 --> 12:02.500
basically emits a new event and the parent component will basically be assigning the new ID here.

12:02.840 --> 12:08.980
It says New Account ID equals this dot and then underline next ID plus but so we were iterating the

12:08.980 --> 12:21.460
text ID by one incrementing and the final thing that remains is that we need to basically push this

12:21.460 --> 12:27.490
new account into our array where accounts are stored up above.

12:27.490 --> 12:31.010
So you have underline counts.

12:31.150 --> 12:37.060
So we just need to basically push it to see underline accounts or we're going to go ahead and store

12:37.060 --> 12:43.840
it there for safekeeping later on we're going to have an actual database so it will be more realistic

12:43.850 --> 12:45.080
so to say.

12:45.860 --> 12:46.270
OK.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.310
So that's basically it.

12:48.340 --> 12:55.430
Nothing in terms of these are my chapters from the Linux server from where I'm pulling them.

12:56.240 --> 13:01.260
Source code and nothing on the side has changed.

13:01.260 --> 13:05.090
I can actually reload the site and there you go.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.490
It's still exactly the same site.

13:07.530 --> 13:13.110
Nothing has changed we have just configured the way that the files are separated.

13:13.110 --> 13:17.760
The way that the components are separated and we have assigned roles to components so you will be in

13:17.760 --> 13:19.940
charge of splaying account forms.

13:19.970 --> 13:25.500
Will be in charge of displaying the accounts you will be in charge of storing the account information

13:25.530 --> 13:26.320
etc..

13:26.490 --> 13:28.110
This is a good programming.

13:28.800 --> 13:34.830
This is a good programming principle for pretty much any any any productive work in terms of programming

13:34.860 --> 13:36.340
of what so ever.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.200
OK.

13:37.440 --> 13:42.620
So I imagine that you're going to have some questions that some things might remain unclear.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.750
So please feel free to ask.

13:45.750 --> 13:52.320
We will be more than happy to reply and help you out in any way that we can with any amount of additional

13:52.320 --> 13:53.610
clarification.

13:54.700 --> 13:59.920
OK so going back to the top of this file there are a few things which we need to import.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.060
So it says import account for.

14:02.090 --> 14:07.820
So we need to import a account form and then we need to specify where it is located the account form

14:07.820 --> 14:16.770
component down below and into the directives we had to include account for so account form is a directive

14:17.070 --> 14:20.720
and this is our new component that we are listing.

14:20.850 --> 14:26.670
We're listing it here sort of sort of the parent component would be would it actually even go looking

14:26.820 --> 14:31.540
for it as it is imported above as well.

14:31.540 --> 14:37.680
So if you want to learn more about the directives we've talked about it and some of the previous chapters

14:37.770 --> 14:38.620
as well.

14:38.820 --> 14:46.200
So I bid you farewell here and hope to see you in the follow up or actually in the next phase of the

14:46.260 --> 14:47.930
account form separation.
