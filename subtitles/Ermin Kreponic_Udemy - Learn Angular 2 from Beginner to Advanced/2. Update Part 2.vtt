00:00.170 --> 00:00.690
OK.

00:00.750 --> 00:03.450
So there is a very simple fix to this.

00:03.450 --> 00:07.000
I went out onto the net and looked it up.

00:07.110 --> 00:09.330
So all you need is this command.

00:09.390 --> 00:11.960
So go ahead and copy it.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.090
I got it from the good people.

00:14.210 --> 00:16.880
Get up and gular QuickStart.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.540
So there's instruction set here.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.680
You will need this command to fix this issue and you will need to delete this folder.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.200
So just go ahead and deleted

00:31.060 --> 00:31.760
OK.

00:31.990 --> 00:38.860
Now go back to the command prompt and just paste this command you paste it with right click and windows

00:40.240 --> 00:42.710
press center and wait for it.

00:46.610 --> 00:47.140
OK.

00:47.280 --> 00:55.150
And now we can type in and PM install one more time just to be silly.

00:59.120 --> 01:10.580
And a third of it has I should improve my singing so I can provide music during these hours during these

01:10.580 --> 01:16.130
moments of silence not compatible with your operating system or architecture.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.420
Something isn't compatible but it's fun.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.750
I think it should be fine.

01:20.140 --> 01:29.250
And then start.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.160
There you go.

01:32.220 --> 01:36.320
It starts so we have fixed there anyway.

01:36.480 --> 01:44.340
As I said before when you perform updates you are likely to encounter problems but hey you need to update

01:44.340 --> 01:47.200
things and you need to solve those problems.

01:47.340 --> 01:52.260
Anyway I'm going to go ahead and bid you farewell here and we're going to go ahead and continue with

01:52.260 --> 01:53.150
the course.
