WEBVTT

00:00.340 --> 00:01.910
Welcome back will.

00:01.920 --> 00:06.950
So today we're going to go ahead and perform a separation.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.240
We will separate our.

00:08.280 --> 00:12.250
We will begin separating our application into subcomponents.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.440
Why would we do this.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.990
Why are we doing this.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.440
Well the code will be a lot more readable to begin with.

00:18.600 --> 00:26.300
Maybe you cannot see it just yet because we have like very few things here and there are rather basic.

00:26.520 --> 00:33.670
But as the code grows and our bigger project this is a very useful and important thing to do.

00:33.690 --> 00:39.680
And above all this is a proper way of coding in most programming languages pretty much anything.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.880
So we are effectively making our subcomponents that we are going to create.

00:46.050 --> 00:52.620
They're going to be reusable and we can use them in other places within the project so we do not need

00:52.620 --> 00:54.000
to retype the code.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.560
The less you have to repeat yourself within within any code the better.

00:58.560 --> 01:04.770
So the very first thing that we need to do is create another folder within the app folder.

01:04.780 --> 01:10.050
So we're going to go ahead and right click on it and we're going to see a new folder.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.650
So the name of this new folder will be counted.

01:14.730 --> 01:18.020
We're going to press enter and that's going to be our folder.

01:18.140 --> 01:22.380
But just in case it is not clear what exactly is it that we are separating.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.240
Kim go ahead and take a look at the site.

01:26.530 --> 01:27.550
Just wait for it to load.

01:27.550 --> 01:36.570
The computer has been like the VM has been really slow today I don't know why but it's not going to

01:36.840 --> 01:37.540
load.

01:37.620 --> 01:41.980
I don't know why I would just reload the site

01:46.300 --> 01:51.650
if any to control save since I didn't do it from the previous one.

01:52.970 --> 01:54.870
I mean just go ahead and control save all of them.

01:58.650 --> 01:59.070
OK

02:01.710 --> 02:02.650
try again.

02:05.610 --> 02:06.100
No

02:09.940 --> 02:14.700
can't we just do the NPM start to see if this is going to help me out a little bit.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.460
It's been running for quite awhile.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.840
And there we go.

02:24.010 --> 02:31.140
So we did load sorry for the confusion and the delay but I said the VM is working really slow today.

02:31.420 --> 02:34.040
So anyway this is these are counted.

02:34.040 --> 02:39.400
So this is one account and this is the other account and we would like to separate this portion of the

02:39.400 --> 02:42.910
code that is in charge of displaying this onto the screen.

02:42.940 --> 02:48.960
And the logic behind it into a separate component which we will be able to reuse So this is the this

02:48.970 --> 02:51.060
is the part ops.

02:51.460 --> 02:53.710
This is the part that we are attempting.

02:53.710 --> 02:59.500
So these two fields that turn into green when we select them these two fields we are actually trying

02:59.500 --> 03:04.600
to not these two fields but the way the accounts are being displayed and pulled.

03:04.720 --> 03:09.760
That is what we are trying to separate into a separate component.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.270
And let's go back into Adam.

03:12.310 --> 03:18.190
So the first thing is we did is create an account that is create a folder called account and we will

03:18.190 --> 03:24.400
take account doffed model dot TS and you will simply click on it hold a mouse and we're going to drag

03:24.400 --> 03:32.490
it over to a folder account release the mouse and you will see that it is now that the account or account

03:32.510 --> 03:35.580
of model Ts is there.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.780
Though we don't actually need to change anything here in terms of code.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.890
We just need to move it to a different location.

03:42.910 --> 03:45.390
That is quite literally it.

03:46.060 --> 03:53.970
Now since we have moved this how we all do will require a few other things here.

03:54.190 --> 03:57.340
So let's go ahead and create the folders that we're going to need.

03:57.340 --> 04:02.530
I have actually written down the names for myself here so we will need accounts underline list subcomponent

04:02.640 --> 04:03.320
at CSSA.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.730
We would like some styling to go here.

04:05.740 --> 04:11.620
We will pull the styling from the old C Ss and of course the bootstrap is still enabled.

04:11.770 --> 04:19.090
We will create its own separate HD M-L which will plug into the main HD M-L We'll see how this is done

04:19.090 --> 04:24.070
as well and we will of course need the TS file as well.

04:24.070 --> 04:26.940
So these three these three files we will need to create.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.260
So let's just go ahead and create them.

04:29.410 --> 04:33.440
I'm just going to go ahead and copy paste this you can type them in its accounts underlined list of

04:33.460 --> 04:37.330
component parts see us nothing too terrible to type in.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.210
So right click on account.

04:39.210 --> 04:42.650
We are creating these files within the folder account.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.080
Right click on our account create.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.270
Click on your file.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.520
You will see it here and then type in the name here.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.690
They will be empty for now.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.590
We will populate them with code very soon.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.900
We just need three names.

04:56.930 --> 05:02.720
We're just doing some basic preparation for the code that we are about to basically migrate.

05:03.110 --> 05:10.690
So to say and we're going to need you now for the third one so we'll need.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.800
We will require the D.S.

05:17.070 --> 05:17.570
as well.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.090
Excellent.

05:18.090 --> 05:25.800
So now we have this the simplest one of these to complete is actually CSSA but from the account sci

05:25.800 --> 05:29.270
fi open up the account I will have success.

05:29.310 --> 05:37.470
So it is empty at the moment and we will what we would want to do is tear this C-s us out of here take

05:37.470 --> 05:39.560
it out of here and put it over there.

05:39.830 --> 05:45.360
I placed small taglines for myself to know which part of the code to actually pool from which from which

05:45.360 --> 05:47.280
file you don't need them.

05:47.430 --> 05:56.280
So control X to copy this code and then go into the newly created CSX file and all you need to do is

05:56.400 --> 05:58.040
just paste it here.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.780
That is quite literally it.

06:00.810 --> 06:05.730
Now we can go into the DML file and it's empty of course.

06:05.790 --> 06:11.940
So we need to go to the Apter component or HDMI file and we're going to pour a portion of the code from

06:11.940 --> 06:13.330
here as well.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.140
So I'll explain what this is.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.850
We are about to plug this in.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.360
But first you need to basically capitis.

06:19.500 --> 06:29.060
So begin from here you have a helper to your accounts begin right down below from just the ups and Keepon

06:29.130 --> 06:36.780
scrolling down to the end of this to the end of the end of Mannat to the end of everything but keep

06:36.780 --> 06:42.580
on scrolling down until you see class row call M.D 6.

06:42.870 --> 06:48.330
So you can see you can see how far have I when you can see where I began selecting and where I ended

06:48.660 --> 06:49.290
the selection.

06:49.290 --> 06:53.880
Just counted divs from the top and counted it was from the bottom and you will be able to make the same

06:53.940 --> 06:54.850
selection.

06:55.140 --> 07:04.940
So control X again just tear it out of there and go into the go into here and paste it OK that's all

07:04.940 --> 07:06.960
you really need to do there.

07:06.980 --> 07:11.580
Now you can go back to the HDMI file from which we actually pulled it.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.370
These are just tags for me.

07:14.670 --> 07:22.050
And we are going to removed the quote remove the comment lines here.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.980
So this is a very special line here.

07:25.010 --> 07:30.510
This is something that we are going to use in order to plug this DML in.

07:30.530 --> 07:39.790
So all of this angular will know to poort basically between these two tacks how we shall achieve this.

07:39.920 --> 07:46.010
I will come back to this in the follow up tutorial but for the time being you need these two tags and

07:46.010 --> 07:53.400
you need to copy DHC a male and CSSA SS code and place it in the L and CSSA folder in the next tutorial.

07:53.420 --> 08:01.070
We will move onto the Ts and here you will actually see how angular we'll know to actually plug the

08:01.070 --> 08:04.980
HMO code between our custom tax year.

08:05.100 --> 08:12.120
So the integrity the integrity of accounts underlying list that component of HDMI file the entirety

08:12.120 --> 08:15.570
of that code will be placed between these two tags.

08:15.630 --> 08:17.430
Not by us but by angular.

08:17.430 --> 08:24.090
When the site is actually loaded so we need to create some sort of logic for that to happen.

08:24.090 --> 08:31.650
So please enact this preparation and in default Tauriel we will jump into the logic of the code in the

08:31.650 --> 08:35.800
account underlined Let's start component Yes in the account folder.
