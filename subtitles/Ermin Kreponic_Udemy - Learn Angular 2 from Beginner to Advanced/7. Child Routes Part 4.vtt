00:00.390 --> 00:10.070
OK so this will be the final stage of the child routes and I've done a few more modifications to d h

00:10.070 --> 00:13.230
d l component to the HDMI files.

00:13.500 --> 00:21.690
So the first the first changes have been conducted to the home component of each DML you have this line

00:21.810 --> 00:23.850
which has been added.

00:24.120 --> 00:30.980
So we're basically creating a link which is routed to accounts.

00:31.140 --> 00:35.860
And this is being done in the home in the home component.

00:37.330 --> 00:45.220
Now if we go into the account data component Datti that HD about this is just an example of how not

00:45.220 --> 00:45.630
to do it.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.390
And this is an example of how to do it.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.440
Why is this how not to do it.

00:51.640 --> 00:58.720
Because we are we are creating a routed link with the slash accounts.

00:59.650 --> 01:03.920
And when you have this slash it begins looking at the route.

01:04.360 --> 01:10.010
This is not always a good idea because the this name accounts might be changed or something like that.

01:10.210 --> 01:18.880
But if we if you listed in a dynamic fashion like this that means that even if the account name changes

01:20.040 --> 01:24.780
and this will still this should still work.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.250
Let's go ahead and take a look at the site and see how this actually looks like.

01:30.700 --> 01:38.760
So if I just open up the default site OK again it says hey personal finance.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.800
Welcome to personal finance.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.650
This is the home component.

01:42.960 --> 01:49.240
And I can click on look at your accounts and I can go ahead and click on Create a new one.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.860
So let's go ahead and look at our accounts and our account.

01:52.950 --> 02:03.450
When I click on look at our accounts I get this so I can say all accounts agree or even go into the

02:03.450 --> 02:12.660
create a new account here where I could actually do it and if I just type in a slash account and press

02:12.660 --> 02:14.600
Enter this is going to take me to a listing.

02:15.060 --> 02:20.370
As you can see here this is this is what we have done in our code.

02:20.370 --> 02:23.560
We have configured this to be the default.

02:23.930 --> 02:24.610
OK.

02:24.900 --> 02:32.520
So we have done some separation again and our application is beginning to look more and more and more

02:32.970 --> 02:39.560
like something from the real world and not something from from the east.

02:39.600 --> 02:46.510
From a school demo so to say OK I'm going to go ahead and delete this part.

02:46.510 --> 02:52.530
By the way because I would like this to be more dynamic and I'm going to go ahead and save that it's

02:52.540 --> 02:54.250
just control us.

02:54.900 --> 02:55.430
OK.

02:55.630 --> 03:02.800
So bid you farewell and let's go ahead and jump into the next chapter.
