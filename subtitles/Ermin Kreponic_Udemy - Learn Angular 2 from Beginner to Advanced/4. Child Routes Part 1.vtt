WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:02.000
Welcome back all.

00:02.010 --> 00:12.030
So today we're going to go ahead and do a little bit more of the separation let me just go back here.

00:12.030 --> 00:14.280
So thus far we have this right.

00:14.340 --> 00:20.100
When you click click on a look at your accounts you get a listing of your accounts but you also get

00:20.160 --> 00:26.070
the ability to create a new account and this box is on the same page sort of.

00:26.070 --> 00:29.620
So we would like to separate these two.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.150
We would like to separate the listing and we would like to separate the creation process of the creation

00:36.150 --> 00:41.040
of the new account and that's what we are going to do so we won't have a lot of new code.

00:41.070 --> 00:44.260
Actually we'll have very little new code if if any at all.

00:44.280 --> 00:54.030
Most of the things that we'll be doing is just creating new files for the new subway routes and we will

00:54.090 --> 01:01.590
do a lot of copy pasting of the code actually just moving the code from from one place to another.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.640
OK.

01:03.210 --> 01:07.880
So the first thing that we need to do is create our cells for files.

01:08.160 --> 01:14.590
So you file open list and thought

01:19.300 --> 01:21.600
component.

01:22.180 --> 01:27.330
TS let me just go ahead and copy paste this

01:30.110 --> 01:31.530
list that I can put under.

01:31.570 --> 01:45.890
TS and this is going to be it should DML and now we're going to get a new file and this will be create

01:46.050 --> 01:46.710
dot

01:48.900 --> 01:52.190
component dot TS

01:57.120 --> 01:59.790
and you'll need DHT M-L for that as well.

01:59.790 --> 02:00.810
So

02:05.340 --> 02:06.150
the.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.140
There we go.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.420
So all four files have indeed been created.

02:11.690 --> 02:18.680
So the very first one that we will begin modifying the we will begin implementing actually is the oldest

02:18.740 --> 02:27.700
DOD component DOD D.S. and from the we're going to be pulling certain things from account data and put

02:27.700 --> 02:29.330
it out to us.

02:29.900 --> 02:34.620
But we'll have to actually type in some things ourselves.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.700
I mean it's kind of cool to pull it out from the center or something like that.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.940
Let's have a look.

02:39.950 --> 02:47.400
So let's go into the counterpart component outyears and from here the very first thing we're going to

02:47.400 --> 02:50.820
need is this.

02:51.610 --> 02:55.210
This one and we'll need the services Ah.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.990
Which is at the bottom.

02:57.420 --> 03:02.290
So let's just go ahead and just go at it one by one.

03:02.640 --> 03:08.010
Excellent So account services is next Actually actually you know what.

03:08.100 --> 03:14.170
Just let me just close these windows.

03:14.470 --> 03:15.400
Close the current one.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.900
It doesn't really matter.

03:30.310 --> 03:36.770
OK so what's the component t s and account component.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.320
Yes.

03:37.340 --> 03:42.780
So those are the two that I'm going to need so I will interchange between the two.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.290
The next thing we need is a counter service.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.000
So there's still a lot of things here.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.020
Let me just see if I can be lazy.

03:53.940 --> 03:56.180
And Cuppy just from two parts like this.

04:01.340 --> 04:08.790
And then I'm going to need the other part as well of course we will need to perform cleanup operations

04:09.360 --> 04:12.040
in order not to have any sort of duplicate sir.

04:12.060 --> 04:18.450
And no you're not have any sort of code which we do not actually which we will not actually require

04:18.730 --> 04:19.280
any more.

04:19.290 --> 04:24.390
I'm just going to go ahead and copy this entire thing and that I'm going to go ahead and cut out the

04:24.520 --> 04:30.030
non-important the non sections which are not actually needed.

04:30.030 --> 04:41.920
So anything other then the templates and directives we are not going to actually require.

04:42.710 --> 04:46.680
And of course we need to just change this.

04:47.050 --> 04:50.510
So the it's going to be less now.

04:50.640 --> 04:59.000
That we have managed to recycle a portion of the code.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.170
I do indeed.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.140
I do I do this like this.

05:02.780 --> 05:07.240
It's control us since to be an error somewhere.

05:08.870 --> 05:12.080
And took up my notes.

05:12.130 --> 05:12.450
Right.

05:12.470 --> 05:12.750
OK.

05:12.770 --> 05:17.990
Our problem is we need to basically import the component as well.

05:19.660 --> 05:25.120
Really should be typing this but my laziness knows no bounds.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.260
And now we're going to go ahead and do this.

05:34.430 --> 05:37.350
This is good practice to see how precise I am.

05:39.060 --> 05:48.710
We're still missing so component account account service and we all need the account list as well.

05:50.130 --> 05:54.730
But let's go ahead and first export a class.

05:54.810 --> 06:05.820
Actually you know what let me just type this an export class this opponent that I'm going to go and

06:05.820 --> 06:06.570
open up this

06:12.530 --> 06:17.620
am so happy when I place markers like this for myself.

06:17.620 --> 06:25.410
That's like the best feeling in the world when you know that the labor does not need to be done get

06:26.020 --> 06:30.760
a bit of messy a bit of messy code but that can be fixed.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.990
We need the account list.

06:33.030 --> 06:38.260
Now we need to actually import that as well.

06:46.180 --> 06:46.870
OK.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.210
So that one's fine.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.090
That one's fine.

06:50.090 --> 06:53.690
These are sort of fine

07:00.410 --> 07:01.050
OK.

07:01.120 --> 07:01.860
Now it should be.

07:01.870 --> 07:04.170
Now it should all be fine and dandy.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.980
Don't actually need these.

07:08.030 --> 07:09.680
These should be gone.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.970
And that is that is it.

07:11.020 --> 07:14.700
That is all that we need to do with this file in order to implement it.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.770
So as you saw the reason we didn't do anything new.

07:17.770 --> 07:24.880
The only piece of credit we've changed is the list Dodd component now price control as to save this

07:25.210 --> 07:29.970
we'll be doing cleanup work on this but not just yet.

07:30.250 --> 07:37.620
We need to implement the three other files and then we're going to go ahead and perform the cleanup.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.710
So can component that HDMI out.

07:41.030 --> 07:45.940
OK so these two there isn't really that much to do.

07:46.510 --> 07:56.260
You a small marker for myself here what copy just control X and control there you go that's it just

07:56.260 --> 08:00.710
control us and me go ahead and delete this as well.

08:02.280 --> 08:08.670
And control us that's it as far as that HDMI is concerned so we don't actually need to do anything else

08:08.760 --> 08:09.750
there.

08:11.640 --> 08:18.600
Not next we need to go into the Create component RTX which is going to be our little bit larger.

08:18.610 --> 08:22.440
And we again need to pool from a count component.

08:22.510 --> 08:23.220
Yes.

08:23.500 --> 08:33.860
So again we need to be actually pooling from this file in order to be able to create in order to be

08:33.860 --> 08:37.090
able to actually implement the Create component.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.010
Yes.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.110
So first of all we have some imports.

08:42.110 --> 08:43.010
Let's see.

08:43.010 --> 08:48.960
We will need you child and we will need a component and we won't need the injector

08:52.540 --> 08:53.550
and touched

08:58.500 --> 09:03.330
k we'll need the count as well.

09:03.330 --> 09:05.760
So we're going to go ahead and just pulled out

09:08.500 --> 09:14.280
and account service hate the two parts.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.820
We'll just do it like this.

09:15.850 --> 09:16.840
And the all deleted

09:20.970 --> 09:21.450
Okay

09:24.710 --> 09:31.810
go and just press and just keep in mind I'm pressing control save as I go.

09:32.720 --> 09:38.400
And for work and need for it as well.

09:38.930 --> 09:44.320
So everything that I am doing here is actually saved.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.980
OK so come ups

09:53.110 --> 09:59.490
opponent to fight tipis right up component.

09:59.630 --> 10:12.320
So go ahead and type in our template you are also complete your are no slouch accounts slash create

10:12.320 --> 10:13.240
slash.

10:13.250 --> 10:19.030
And now it's actually create a component component.

10:19.150 --> 10:29.130
H d h d m l and I have an extra read here just a typo.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.220
And we're going to need that directive down below.

10:33.470 --> 10:36.810
So let's go ahead and type in let's go ahead and create our directive

10:44.040 --> 10:45.320
account for

10:48.130 --> 10:49.430
it.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.340
Right.

10:53.150 --> 10:55.450
Just made an error there but it's fine.

10:55.580 --> 10:58.770
No big deal to us just spelling errors anyway.

10:59.750 --> 11:03.640
Export clerks create

11:06.350 --> 11:09.880
export class create component.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.720
And now.

11:11.990 --> 11:17.320
Let me just see if I can make use of this part here.

11:26.030 --> 11:33.110
I'm not going to need the upper one so.

11:33.590 --> 11:35.710
And let's put it like this.

11:40.690 --> 11:43.890
It's going to be this.

11:44.030 --> 11:52.530
And let's just do a little bit of a little bit of a garbage disposal so to say a very cruel word in

11:52.560 --> 11:57.920
this particular scenario but oh well now we're going to need

12:01.140 --> 12:14.690
private carry string and we'll need the private create account and remove account and view child.

12:14.890 --> 12:15.730
OK.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.830
Right now I need to go

12:32.040 --> 12:39.830
on the constructor and just paste this in and let's see what all the errors are about

12:43.380 --> 12:45.180
exp class.

12:45.190 --> 12:48.790
OK so this let me just I mean just do a short checkup.

12:49.210 --> 12:51.750
So these are closed here.

12:51.880 --> 12:56.800
All is fine and dandy control S and that's it.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.780
So that's it.

12:57.790 --> 13:03.120
We don't actually need to do anything else in the D.S. file.

13:03.190 --> 13:10.480
Now we need to go ahead and mess around with the component d'arte HD M-O so create component abart HD

13:10.530 --> 13:19.080
amount and this one also it kind of needs things to be placed in here.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.500
So let's just go ahead and write this

13:30.470 --> 13:31.280
actually.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.950
You know what I'm going to just copy it from here.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.890
Excellent save.

13:40.900 --> 13:49.150
So that is literally all that we need to do afterwards in the rest Tauriel we'll just perform cleanup

13:49.150 --> 13:57.130
operations on D account that can put it out email an account and point and Dot TS because now they have

13:57.250 --> 14:04.920
a lot of redundant code which needs to be basically removed and they will be significantly downsized.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.120
But your farewell and hope to see you in the follow up.
