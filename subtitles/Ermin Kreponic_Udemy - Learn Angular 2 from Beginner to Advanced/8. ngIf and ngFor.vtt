00:00.300 --> 00:01.900
Welcome back all.

00:01.920 --> 00:09.690
So today I am going to go ahead and open up the talk about angular directives but we're going to primarily

00:09.690 --> 00:15.810
talk about energy and energy for as they are angular directives and we will in all likelihood be using

00:15.810 --> 00:17.240
them later on as well.

00:17.250 --> 00:25.410
But for now you need these two NGF in our case here will mean that if condition has been met it will

00:25.410 --> 00:30.020
display the element otherwise the element will not even exist.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.270
So I'm referring to this line here.

00:32.280 --> 00:38.370
So if this is false this line will not exist if this is true this line will exist.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.530
So not only being displayed or not being displayed but it exists or does not exist depending on the

00:43.530 --> 00:47.900
condition here the status of the condition here.

00:47.960 --> 01:00.800
Anyway this is very similar to hidden to the hidden element but it is different in the sense that with

01:00.810 --> 01:02.050
hidden.

01:02.050 --> 01:08.520
You remember when we used hidden here in the previous tutorials this paragraph is either displayed or

01:08.520 --> 01:13.350
not displayed with hidden but with Ngee if it exists or it does not exist.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.170
So if it doesn't exist Obviously it cannot be displayed as well.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.210
That is the difference between them.

01:18.250 --> 01:24.450
However whether we use hidden or NGF in our case it really doesn't make any difference in terms of the

01:24.450 --> 01:28.900
user viewing the actual page or the content being displayed there.

01:29.430 --> 01:36.400
So another thing that we need to know about another directive is really to be familiar with is the NGI

01:36.400 --> 01:44.870
for an entry for in essence is a loop or a way of looping through something or repeating the code.

01:44.970 --> 01:48.070
I will demonstrate it down below very soon.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.090
So we have my first thing to this.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.500
We know that this part has been explained extensively.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.630
And then we come to this part.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.240
So it says here.

01:58.260 --> 01:58.700
Right.

01:58.710 --> 02:02.660
So let's change it to true ups.

02:04.270 --> 02:06.770
The truth and say it.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.950
So now this paragraph is to be shown so there is nothing really new in this paragraph.

02:11.960 --> 02:17.090
I mean you have these E-M tags which means that the letters will be tilted to the right but that's about

02:17.090 --> 02:18.200
it.

02:18.200 --> 02:24.620
We've already talked about all the all the all the segments of this element of paragraph.

02:24.890 --> 02:33.160
But anyway the NGF here if it is true the element will exist and therefore it will be displayed.

02:33.740 --> 02:34.340
OK.

02:34.450 --> 02:38.030
So yup it's definitely there your email is.

02:38.030 --> 02:39.750
Test that test dot com.

02:39.750 --> 02:43.070
So your email is and then current user dot email.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.140
Excellent.

02:44.360 --> 02:54.860
But if you go back to the site and if you press F 12 and I have zoomed this in as much as I could probably

02:54.860 --> 02:57.450
a little bit more hopefully you can see everything now.

02:57.830 --> 03:05.600
If you go into body and then my app and then scroll down and go into the first day of and then scroll

03:05.600 --> 03:11.750
down you will see ups that were you will see that there is a paragraph here.

03:11.820 --> 03:17.730
You open up the paragraph and you see indeed that the that the paragraph itself doesn't exist.

03:17.730 --> 03:21.230
It says your email is and then test that test dot com.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.580
OK so it exists.

03:24.030 --> 03:36.460
But if we close this and go back to the atom and change this to false and if you save it and then go

03:36.460 --> 03:42.070
back to the site and wait for it to load you will see that the email is not written out at all so it

03:42.070 --> 03:50.290
doesn't it's it's not there it's supposed to say your email is except for five press of 12 again.

03:50.670 --> 03:59.670
If by open up the body and if I open up my app and if I go into the first live as before you will see

03:59.760 --> 04:03.300
the paragraph which we were looking for doesn't actually exist at all.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.470
It's not here it's non existent.

04:08.290 --> 04:13.400
So that's what I want to do with ngi for now for the time being.

04:14.680 --> 04:21.940
I want you to disregard the asterisks as that falls into a rather advanced subject that will be processed

04:21.940 --> 04:23.830
later on during the course.

04:23.890 --> 04:30.460
But as I said for now only need to know is that it needs to be placed in front of NGF and ngi force

04:30.460 --> 04:32.000
or this is the syntax.

04:32.270 --> 04:36.350
Energy and energy for with Asterix in front.

04:36.370 --> 04:41.400
I will explain later on when we get to the complex things that advanced things.

04:41.410 --> 04:45.760
But for the time being there just is no point of whatsoever for me to explain it as it would only serve

04:45.760 --> 04:48.900
the purpose of confusing a lot of people out there.

04:49.270 --> 04:55.060
And you can use this exact same syntax and just change false to true or true to false.

04:55.360 --> 05:00.780
You can use it pretty much anywhere in pretty much any element to display that element or not displayed

05:00.850 --> 05:03.940
for that element to exist or for that element not preexist.

05:04.150 --> 05:07.570
We will make this dynamic in a moment.

05:07.870 --> 05:14.380
So we are going to go back to our app component Altius and everything is the same.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.930
So we'll get to this part as well.

05:15.940 --> 05:21.000
But for the time being I just want you to take a look at the hide e-mail bullion that we have and we're

05:21.010 --> 05:25.360
going to utilize it in order to make this more flexible and more dynamic.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.240
So I'm just going to go ahead and do.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.630
Exclamation mark.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.950
Hide e-mail.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.040
OK.

05:32.290 --> 05:38.850
So you can play you can you can play around with variables or properties as they're called in angler

05:38.860 --> 05:39.430
too.

05:39.460 --> 05:43.310
So Heidi mail here and I'm going to go ahead and negate hide e-mail.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.920
So what does it mean to negate it.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.210
Well if it's false when negated it will become true.

05:49.040 --> 05:55.150
So this will be this will be this when this is evaluated this will actually be true.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.820
Therefore the Spirograph will exist.

05:58.010 --> 06:01.370
Why are we using this bullet here so that the button would actually work.

06:01.370 --> 06:04.970
Because for the time being it doesn't actually work it doesn't do anything.

06:04.970 --> 06:09.110
You see when I talk or click nothing happens it is not displayed.

06:09.950 --> 06:13.250
But when I put this in here I didn't save it yet.

06:13.520 --> 06:22.910
And down below I say unclick call method the goal and method to go basically uses the Boullion and then

06:23.300 --> 06:29.420
negates the Boullion and changes for false to true and true to false or depending on art depending on

06:29.420 --> 06:30.930
the number depending on the click.

06:30.930 --> 06:34.720
So if you click it it's going to change it and depending on the initial status.

06:34.910 --> 06:39.760
If I save this now and wait for it to load.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.310
See when I click it disappears but I click it it reappears.

06:43.330 --> 06:55.940
UPS UPS UPS UPS it pops in and out of existence so to say OK now we can move on down below the UL.

06:56.220 --> 06:59.700
We have basically we have a list of users who wish to display.

06:59.700 --> 07:06.280
So we will use the UL element as that is an element for an ordered list.

07:06.300 --> 07:16.590
So UL an ordered list and then we have the L I which is which is again an HD on an HD M-L element and

07:16.590 --> 07:19.250
it stands for list elements

07:22.030 --> 07:28.320
reward it basically is for list elements it's ally but it's less Dortmund's.

07:28.510 --> 07:34.510
Anyway we would like to add for every user one a list item.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.220
So Engy will do this for us.

07:37.220 --> 07:41.820
So what do we mean by adding a list item for every user.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.220
Well this is a list.

07:44.360 --> 07:52.040
I mean this is this is NHT an element for list elements and we would like this to happen what we have

07:52.040 --> 07:52.520
on our page.

07:52.520 --> 08:00.680
So you have like a list item for one analyst night of two and three and four and you have certain things

08:00.680 --> 08:03.030
that are printed out for every one of these.

08:03.190 --> 08:03.830
OK.

08:05.960 --> 08:12.920
So for that we need to use energy for order for us to use the energy for we need some sort of array.

08:12.950 --> 08:16.600
So we've created an array here India component company to.

08:16.790 --> 08:26.780
And this is a basically this is a property of type array whose elements are of type user.

08:26.780 --> 08:31.740
So once again this is a property called users.

08:31.760 --> 08:41.060
That's an arbitrary name of type array whose elements are of type user and interface user exists down

08:41.060 --> 08:44.860
below which we have created way way way way way back.

08:44.960 --> 08:51.310
So the contents of this cerate basically have user name user name user name user name are types or you

08:51.310 --> 08:54.900
get username here and user one is of type username.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.100
These are two of type user name and so on.

08:57.230 --> 09:04.490
Again email user 1 at example dot com type e-mail and so on for the rest of them.

09:04.940 --> 09:09.100
So we would like to display all of them on to the screen.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.780
We could of course access each one of these manually but that's like imagine if you had 200 elements

09:13.790 --> 09:19.940
are you seriously going to access every one every one of them manually that would that would be insane

09:19.940 --> 09:22.250
for the lack for the lack of a better word.

09:22.280 --> 09:27.890
That's why we use a loop to go through each one to go through each element and for the loop to do the

09:28.010 --> 09:30.430
painstakingly hard process for us.

09:30.680 --> 09:37.880
So to say anyway I'm going to go ahead and split the split down

09:40.680 --> 09:41.790
and get back to the array.

09:41.790 --> 09:46.350
Let me just resize it a little bit so that it's a little bit clearer so that we can correlate between

09:46.350 --> 09:47.480
the two.

09:48.210 --> 09:48.720
OK.

09:48.840 --> 09:56.950
So this loop here so esoterics and G-4 now hash user that's an arbitrary name.

09:56.950 --> 10:00.820
We could have typed in whatever we wanted if we could have typed in Thaller blah blah blah blah whatever

10:00.820 --> 10:04.400
or we could just smash the keyboard and then offi off.

10:04.410 --> 10:06.660
This is part of the syntax so this is mandatory.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.760
This is as it is so off.

10:08.910 --> 10:16.710
And then users which is referring to this array the property of type arrays so users.

10:16.710 --> 10:19.710
And this is something we're going to come to in a moment.

10:19.770 --> 10:29.950
So what we are doing here in essence is basically Engy for will loop through every user.

10:29.990 --> 10:42.080
So through every user here in a property of users of type array and it will make an ally element for

10:42.170 --> 10:43.590
each iteration.

10:43.610 --> 10:54.060
So for each user it will actually create NLI element what is going on so users is being pooled the values

10:54.060 --> 10:58.420
from it are being pooled and they're being placed into user.

10:58.560 --> 11:05.430
And then the user and then by using what's been put into user enlightenments will be created for each

11:05.430 --> 11:06.480
one of them.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.090
Now index that we have plays to here.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.360
So indexes a keyword.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.790
You can type in whatever you want.

11:14.390 --> 11:19.620
A place a hash and then a name of your iterator and then equal.

11:19.620 --> 11:26.050
And then here you need an index keyword and then down below where you will keep track of our iteration

11:26.070 --> 11:28.520
so that we know that this was the first that this was the second.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.750
This was the third that this was the fourth etc..

11:30.900 --> 11:37.020
Then you have user darte user name so you are pulling the username from the up above.

11:37.020 --> 11:40.360
So use it as user username.

11:40.370 --> 11:41.430
Sorry not far above

11:44.300 --> 11:45.640
you're pulling it from right here.

11:45.650 --> 11:46.170
My bad.

11:46.190 --> 11:51.630
So basically typing user and then Daut and then username.

11:51.860 --> 11:58.430
OK so whatever is the current iteration wherever it is it's right it's going to pool like user 1.

11:58.970 --> 12:02.070
So and then we have this minus sign.

12:02.070 --> 12:06.120
We're not really doing anything with it which is displaying a dash of the screen and then the tilted

12:06.120 --> 12:07.430
letters of the user.

12:07.530 --> 12:08.300
Email.

12:08.650 --> 12:09.120
OK.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.940
So I know it it's so confusing.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.420
And let's go through it one more time.

12:14.760 --> 12:19.150
This to make sure that you understand this because this is quite important and I know the first time

12:19.150 --> 12:23.620
I've learned about this it it took me took me like three or four explanations to actually figure it

12:23.620 --> 12:23.820
out.

12:23.830 --> 12:28.940
I know that you can rewind video but I like to make things easy for you anyway.

12:29.590 --> 12:35.930
You have this user which is an arbitrary name a reference and it says off.

12:36.040 --> 12:46.390
And then you have the name of the phrase so users users here and it will take this entire line and place.

12:46.400 --> 12:52.570
Users will take this entire line and then with will place it into user.

12:52.690 --> 13:01.210
And then when you print it out onto the screen it will say user dot username so user dot username which

13:01.210 --> 13:04.500
is referring to this username which is the first iteration.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.370
So what is the value of it.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.570
It's user 1.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.650
And then you have user dot e-mail.

13:12.070 --> 13:16.410
The value of email is user one at example dot com.

13:16.690 --> 13:20.740
And then it will create an ally and for each one of these.

13:20.740 --> 13:23.340
And it will play it on the screen.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.940
Simple as that.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.370
Now you why did you didn't understand it.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.590
And if you still need help.

13:28.600 --> 13:34.240
Well we're always to find your questions to be welcoming in the Q and A section so please feel free

13:34.660 --> 13:37.240
to post as many as you like.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.960
And we will do our best to actually explain it.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.940
Let's go ahead and inspect this page once again so just press 12 if your Firefox and windows

13:49.790 --> 13:57.480
and go into the body go into my app and go to.

13:57.650 --> 14:05.100
And as you can see make ups go go.

14:05.120 --> 14:05.510
There you go.

14:05.510 --> 14:10.260
So for each one of these Let me just a case of each one of these.

14:10.430 --> 14:14.950
You had an ally element that was created say a user.

14:15.860 --> 14:23.750
Forget it says here for Kate for Ally Allaman first of course but you can see it on the screen and then

14:23.750 --> 14:31.270
it says user for Dasch user for dash and then have user for example dot com.

14:31.490 --> 14:35.720
And it's an alignment and this process has been repeated for each one of these.

14:35.720 --> 14:41.870
Now imagine if you had like three 400 elements you would really want to loop through them.

14:41.870 --> 14:47.780
You really wouldn't want to create an alignment for each single individual element.

14:47.780 --> 14:55.430
I mean that would be for each each individual to like value or each individual line that would be horrible.

14:55.430 --> 14:57.640
I mean your code would look enormous.

14:57.710 --> 15:01.310
That is why we use loops here.

15:01.780 --> 15:02.290
Sort of.

15:02.420 --> 15:08.360
So it's ngi for which is basic basically in essence a loop like that with a grain of salt.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.200
OK.

15:09.240 --> 15:16.640
So bid you farewell and hope to see you in the follow tutorial where we will actually begin the construction

15:16.730 --> 15:25.010
of our application so front the next one in all likelihood we will begin constructing a real world application

15:25.100 --> 15:29.580
that you will begin begin building from scratch.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.050
You will see nothing.

15:31.310 --> 15:36.620
And then over the period of a certain period of time as you watch these courses and as you do what I

15:36.620 --> 15:41.810
do you will see your application come alive with your firewall.
