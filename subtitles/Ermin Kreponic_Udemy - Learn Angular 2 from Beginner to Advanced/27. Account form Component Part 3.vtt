00:00.300 --> 00:01.970
Welcome back all.

00:01.980 --> 00:07.370
So today we're going to continue building on what we have already created.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.280
But before we get into the code let me go ahead and explain what we are about to do.

00:12.530 --> 00:18.660
So I hope that you have a the server running with NPM start.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.030
And here is the cereal.

00:21.050 --> 00:26.690
And just be fresh and refresh the site OK.

00:26.920 --> 00:34.510
So imagine for a moment that in some parallel universe you have a limited amount of accounts that you

00:34.510 --> 00:36.240
can make on a certain server.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.880
So that's just one of the stupid errors that can happen.

00:39.280 --> 00:46.830
And in our case you could only create three accounts on the server because we are so generous and if

00:46.830 --> 00:56.100
I type in blah blah create and smash my keyboard in the most random of fashions you know every time

00:56.100 --> 01:01.570
I smacked my keyboard I keep thinking that it's random but these things keep on looking the same.

01:02.190 --> 01:06.860
And it says OK creating error only three accounts are allowed.

01:09.660 --> 01:16.390
OK but that's something that we've implemented.

01:16.900 --> 01:22.780
Basically the server tells you OK you can only create three accounts but this is probably not the best

01:22.780 --> 01:23.710
way to handle this.

01:23.710 --> 01:24.240
Why.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.830
Because you see I typed something in.

01:25.840 --> 01:33.070
I typed something in again and I click on Create and that gives me an error and it all basically disappears.

01:33.070 --> 01:35.170
Now this can be a different type of an error.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.450
You can have a field that is populated by something that it is not supposed to contain.

01:40.660 --> 01:47.250
And you can say improper values in the fields or something like that but what that error happens.

01:47.280 --> 01:55.020
You don't want the fields to be reset completely because you don't want the user to have to input everything

01:55.050 --> 02:00.120
over and over again until he gets the proper inputs.

02:00.150 --> 02:05.100
Rather instead he just wanted throw the error message and leave whatever the user has written in this

02:05.100 --> 02:14.090
field marking the fields in one way or another possibly which contain faulty information.

02:14.520 --> 02:19.500
So that's one of the that's one of possible error handlings because you need these error handlers you

02:19.500 --> 02:25.140
will need a good amount of them which will have some sort of procedures for this and for the possible

02:25.140 --> 02:27.550
scenarios which might happen.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.700
So we're just going to add to the account for today.

02:33.930 --> 02:39.990
We're just going to add more code to the files which we have created previously and implement this logic

02:40.000 --> 02:43.910
so that's all I really wanted to say here and now we're going to go ahead and jump into the code.
