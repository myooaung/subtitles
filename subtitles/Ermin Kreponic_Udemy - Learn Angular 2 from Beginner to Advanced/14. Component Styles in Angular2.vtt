WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:01.860
OK we'll come back.

00:01.860 --> 00:04.950
So today we're going to mess around with styles.

00:05.010 --> 00:14.490
I will show you how you can plug in CSX and how you can customize the appearance of your site.

00:14.490 --> 00:18.900
Of course this will be the bare minimum customization just to show you how it's done.

00:18.990 --> 00:26.730
As we progressed through the course we will implement more and more customization in terms of appearance

00:26.790 --> 00:31.170
so that our site actually begins to look like a real deal.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.500
So to say.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.980
So the very first thing that you need to do is to go into Apter components start TS and type in style

00:38.740 --> 00:42.390
Jor-El's colon and then type this in.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.290
Now we're plugging.

00:43.290 --> 00:48.970
Now we are specifying a path here to a file which at the moment is non-existent.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.380
So what do we need to do.

00:50.430 --> 00:53.620
Well I'll just go ahead and create the file.

00:53.650 --> 01:01.920
So right click on app new file and in the top center you will get a prompt where you will type B in

01:02.400 --> 01:19.590
a p p dot and dot C Ss So the slash component dot C Ss and that will be a path to our That will be the

01:19.590 --> 01:23.480
path to our file.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.540
My apologies here just need to rectify this.

01:26.550 --> 01:27.840
Excellent.

01:27.840 --> 01:28.130
There we go.

01:28.140 --> 01:36.150
So the backslash AP B.Com component that SS even though in the stylus you RL It's a slash.

01:36.180 --> 01:40.690
Because we are working on a Windows machine so keep that in mind.

01:41.550 --> 01:45.330
It's supposed to look like this on a Windows machine on a Mac or Linux.

01:45.330 --> 01:50.700
We just use slash and your path here would look exactly the same as the path here.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.780
Simple as that.

01:51.780 --> 01:52.600
No big deal.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.410
But on Windows it's a little bit different.

01:55.410 --> 02:04.860
So we need to keep that in mind so we thought that see us enter.

02:05.230 --> 02:05.640
OK.

02:05.650 --> 02:08.070
So we have created it and it's emptied out.

02:08.100 --> 02:13.870
I'm just going to take this code and paste it here.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.720
So don't worry you'll have the code under the lectures anyway.

02:16.730 --> 02:20.320
But as I said I advise you to always type it in your cells.

02:21.670 --> 02:28.530
It's this dot info and and there are some things which resemble English in English language as background

02:28.530 --> 02:31.050
padding margin color etc..

02:31.940 --> 02:32.860
What is this.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.850
Well if I press can I just think the press control is to save it.

02:36.870 --> 02:48.490
Well this is a reference to r d h d e mails so within the age D.M. we can take a look for a top.

02:48.580 --> 02:54.120
I have added a few things here so indiv it says class equals info.

02:54.270 --> 03:00.480
Ok so class equals info and that is how C Ss will know.

03:00.490 --> 03:08.040
So dot info is referring to that class and we're setting the background color for that so this background

03:08.040 --> 03:16.110
color is referring to the background color of the entire div So whatever whatever this div takes that

03:16.110 --> 03:21.690
will altered that will alter the background color that defeat will see how this works.

03:21.690 --> 03:24.030
Actually you can see it now.

03:24.060 --> 03:24.700
There you go.

03:24.750 --> 03:28.390
So you see this now has background Gray.

03:28.420 --> 03:37.280
This thing also has background gray and can play around with it to your heart's content but you are

03:37.280 --> 03:44.770
referring to a div through typing it basically by typing in class equals and then you type in something

03:44.780 --> 03:54.210
here some arbitrary name which you later on use in D.C. SS file and state DOT for class so info and

03:54.280 --> 03:54.860
specify.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.840
This is going to be the background color.

03:56.840 --> 04:02.690
This is a hexadecimal representation of the color and you can just go onto the net and type in C SSX

04:02.690 --> 04:08.870
the small presentation of colors and you can find each individual hexadecimal representation for each

04:08.870 --> 04:09.920
individual color.

04:11.050 --> 04:14.350
Though you will have you will have to do it that way.

04:14.720 --> 04:19.220
Now padding What is the padding referring to.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.230
It says 10 x and 24 x.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.560
So this is like 10 pixels and twenty four pixels.

04:27.950 --> 04:30.330
Let's go ahead and open this up.

04:31.290 --> 04:46.030
And you have it's referring to see it says dot dot info and HD M-L dot info.

04:46.050 --> 04:50.920
It's referring to the end of the day so you can see where the answer is yes.

04:51.610 --> 04:54.220
That's what you what we have typed in for info.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.880
It's not actually being yet displayed on the screen.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.760
That's why I got a little bit confused.

04:58.780 --> 05:01.620
We need to delete the accounts or delete delete.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.590
And there you go.

05:02.860 --> 05:05.220
So you don't have any accounts yet.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.180
Please.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.760
Just one more thing.

05:12.060 --> 05:19.590
So you don't need to do this but it is Google soft wrap so you can see everything in on one screen so

05:19.590 --> 05:21.750
I don't have to scroll left and right.

05:24.010 --> 05:30.170
Anyway you have this DIVX and we have a CSA style for this there.

05:32.450 --> 05:32.930
Right here.

05:32.930 --> 05:40.130
So it's blue and the margin padding which I've explained is the padding that refers to this text in

05:40.130 --> 05:43.350
regard to the div around it.

05:43.370 --> 05:47.480
So you see this is the deal which is colored blue.

05:47.480 --> 05:54.130
And my apologies this this is not this is not great this is actually blue.

05:54.150 --> 05:58.070
Down below we have down below we have actually gray.

05:58.350 --> 06:02.070
Apologies for that but it's kind of difficult to read hexadecimal numbers by heart and know exactly

06:02.070 --> 06:03.740
which color it is.

06:03.810 --> 06:08.160
But in any case it says 10 pixels and 24 think souls.

06:08.160 --> 06:17.800
So in terms of height and in terms of width height and width that is the padding.

06:17.800 --> 06:23.920
So we would like to move from the edge 10 pixels and we would like to move.

06:23.980 --> 06:30.850
We would like to move from the bottom 10 pixels and we would like to move from the edge 24 pixels.

06:30.940 --> 06:36.070
So basically just look at the cursor movement height width.

06:36.370 --> 06:42.530
So from left to right that would be with and from top to bottom that would be height.

06:42.750 --> 06:48.850
Actually we're moving from the top 10 pixels downwards as you can see this is not a lot this text here

06:48.850 --> 06:54.070
is you don't have any accounts yet please added This is not actually aligned to the center.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.860
If you observe it carefully you will see that it's not in the actual center it's it goes a little bit

06:59.860 --> 07:03.760
down it goes a little bit down more than it should.

07:03.970 --> 07:06.550
Just a little tiny bit as far as I can see.

07:06.940 --> 07:12.460
But don't worry I will show you will be shown how you can center things and how you can position position

07:12.460 --> 07:15.040
them the way you want them to be.

07:15.040 --> 07:21.200
Now the next thing is the margin no margin applies.

07:21.210 --> 07:21.720
UPS

07:24.870 --> 07:28.960
box no margin applies to around there.

07:28.980 --> 07:35.240
So this is the general margin from the top from the bottom from left and from right.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.440
How much distance they want to put between.

07:38.490 --> 07:45.740
This this blue background they have and everything else around it you can specify individually.

07:45.830 --> 07:53.580
Left right bottom top margins but we've just type in margins so one general one general distance from

07:53.670 --> 07:55.010
everything else.

07:56.580 --> 08:00.770
And color black that is referring to the text.

08:01.140 --> 08:11.200
So the texture will be of color black Next up we have dot A.S.C. class if we go back into the HD mount

08:14.230 --> 08:15.360
CC class.

08:15.380 --> 08:15.960
There we go.

08:16.040 --> 08:23.510
So the next wave is this one says class A.S.C. stands for count and we would like to create an individual

08:23.510 --> 08:28.720
CSSA for that as well and individual theosis ruling for that sort of say.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.680
So the background color once again of the div is specified here so this will be great.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.290
And then you have the padding.

08:36.320 --> 08:41.270
Same as before and that you have a margin and the color of the text.

08:41.270 --> 08:50.600
Let me just go ahead and reload the site so you can see the Pattee the inner padding has been done and

08:50.630 --> 08:55.260
you have the color that is gray around there.

08:55.340 --> 09:00.260
And the text is explicitly black as we have specified it to be black.

09:00.470 --> 09:04.140
And then you have another margin which basically separates these two.

09:04.170 --> 09:13.380
I mean just go ahead and margin 8 pixels Marjorie and I can actually just do this control.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.140
Cut it up on that one sorted them on.

09:16.170 --> 09:23.910
Below I can just do this control X and save and then let it reload.

09:23.920 --> 09:29.980
You see then there is no spacing between these two which is a problem we would like for since we would

09:29.980 --> 09:32.060
like to allow for some space there.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.880
Kill it at load X on.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.040
Now you can see that there is space between the two digits.

09:41.450 --> 09:47.690
I would like you to play around with this a little bit change it alter it and see what actually happens

09:47.870 --> 09:50.570
what changes can you enact on the site.

09:50.600 --> 09:56.720
The way I would recommend you do or I would recommend it is try to change something and try to figure

09:56.720 --> 10:01.550
out what will happen before it actually happens on the site and then go onto the site and see if you're

10:01.550 --> 10:04.730
right wrong and see what actually happened.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.410
That's one of the best ways to learn.

10:06.410 --> 10:07.350
In my opinion anyway

10:10.430 --> 10:13.450
down below we have a dot A.S.C..

10:14.130 --> 10:21.390
And then you have a greater than sign and a wildcard character here basically an asterix.

10:21.780 --> 10:22.770
What does it mean.

10:22.980 --> 10:32.800
Well the greater than sign means the children of the children of this class and then we've stated all

10:32.810 --> 10:33.390
the children.

10:33.390 --> 10:43.350
So apply the margin of 4 pixels to all the children if we just go back to each DML says A.S.C..

10:43.380 --> 10:51.840
So all of these are children but we have said OK please apply Marjan to everybody.

10:51.930 --> 10:58.830
Don't just not do this one in particular not this one in particular but apply the margin to all the

10:58.830 --> 11:00.880
children down below.

11:02.610 --> 11:03.360
And there you go.

11:03.420 --> 11:06.510
So we have the margins and it works flawlessly.

11:06.510 --> 11:16.480
Now this has been basic services plugging in or specifying custom styles we thin angular to but later

11:16.480 --> 11:20.770
on as I said we will go into far more complex things.

11:20.770 --> 11:23.830
One key note is that there is a Z.

11:24.010 --> 11:27.680
There is some sort of a bootstrap running in the background angular too.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.420
So it already looks relatively.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.890
I mean it's still ugly.

11:32.890 --> 11:33.670
Don't get me wrong.

11:33.700 --> 11:39.880
But he looks relatively good as opposed to just typing in text in HDMI and displaying it on the screen

11:39.880 --> 11:41.300
which would be even uglier.

11:41.320 --> 11:49.000
But don't worry we shall ensure that our application resembles Atli resembles a real life real world

11:49.060 --> 11:54.890
application that looks attractive and modern to an extent of course.

11:54.920 --> 11:59.780
So once again please please please play around with the CSSA file.

11:59.810 --> 12:01.880
Try altering things.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.150
Try putting in different colors.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.140
Try putting in different things.

12:06.140 --> 12:09.470
Try left right margin find the syntax on the net.

12:09.470 --> 12:10.820
I strongly encourage you to do so.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.530
It would be very easy for me to write.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.180
Left right bottom margins here and show them to you how they work.

12:16.190 --> 12:18.670
But I really want you to basically just try it out.

12:18.770 --> 12:19.710
It's not that difficult.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.860
It's really easy.

12:21.860 --> 12:26.510
Just type it in and see what happens.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.210
Try to change the padding and see what happens.

12:29.210 --> 12:31.420
Just try try changing these numbers.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.920
Try changing the munged number.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.900
Try changing the background color and see what sort of V.

12:38.090 --> 12:42.430
See how the changes will be reflected on the site itself.

12:42.440 --> 12:50.320
So anyway I'm going to bid you farewell here and I will see you in the follow up tutorial.
