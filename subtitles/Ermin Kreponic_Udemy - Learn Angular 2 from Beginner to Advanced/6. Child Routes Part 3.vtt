WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.800
Welcome back all.

00:01.800 --> 00:09.970
So now that we have prepared all the components that we will need we can deal with the child around

00:10.030 --> 00:16.160
us before we basically configured all the routes in the apparatus.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.850
DART Yes.

00:19.410 --> 00:27.390
And this is fine for some general configuration and we indeed can register all of our routes there but

00:27.450 --> 00:38.730
our mom our module account would not really be reusable because the configuration for its routes is

00:38.880 --> 00:41.010
outside somewhere.

00:41.220 --> 00:49.380
So we will if we were to use it anywhere else we would basically be missing a vital part of the accounts.

00:49.500 --> 00:57.150
So we will instead create a file inside of the account folder where we shall define all the routes for

00:57.150 --> 01:05.780
this module and then we shall simply import them into apt our routes and then we can use them there

01:05.790 --> 01:08.840
and play around with them and so on and so forth.

01:09.090 --> 01:13.270
So let's go ahead and create account that route start ups

01:17.500 --> 01:28.910
county road type D s and that's going to go ahead and create this file for us.

01:28.910 --> 01:32.480
Now we need to go ahead and implemented

01:35.630 --> 01:39.040
first into import.

01:39.230 --> 01:44.840
And I'm really stupid for actually not having a file from which to capitis are going to have to type

01:44.840 --> 01:49.050
it in router config.

01:52.260 --> 01:54.000
From ups

01:59.320 --> 02:03.920
and killers router.

02:07.010 --> 02:07.710
There we go.

02:07.970 --> 02:20.240
So this is basically an array of routes and every route is an object that describes one of the routing

02:20.390 --> 02:21.380
routes.

02:21.380 --> 02:29.510
So to say I use it I have explained this before and you'll see down below how it actually looks like

02:30.190 --> 02:35.530
once you see the shape of it it becomes a lot clearer than the actual explanation.

02:35.630 --> 02:38.420
So import this is nothing new.

02:38.570 --> 02:56.890
So count Peronne and we have imported this plenty of times from and this is going to be a counter component

02:57.880 --> 03:03.880
and Double-O will actually utilize some of our newly created files.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.740
So these will be Moul

03:13.610 --> 03:17.690
list list component.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.640
And then it's going to be from

03:23.660 --> 03:28.380
that list of component

03:35.060 --> 03:35.720
OK.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.330
And we're going to import the Create component as well so

03:41.840 --> 03:42.770
import

03:47.710 --> 03:50.230
components from

03:53.780 --> 03:57.340
create dead component.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.510
OK.

04:00.770 --> 04:01.450
There we go.

04:02.610 --> 04:10.380
Next up we're going to go ahead and export a we're going to create a constant array and then we're going

04:10.380 --> 04:11.970
to go ahead and export it.

04:11.970 --> 04:12.960
Why Konst.

04:13.200 --> 04:23.580
Well because we don't want it to be changed at all ever by anyone else for commerce routes

04:26.040 --> 04:30.360
router config Cool's

04:34.180 --> 04:41.690
and now we're going to get the spelling is right.

04:41.740 --> 04:54.280
So the first part is very similar to before code so Coomber this is basically D U R L for the route

04:54.900 --> 05:00.090
to slash or call it when you type it on the website like Slash accounts like before that demo that I

05:00.090 --> 05:03.590
did for you you will be ending up here.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.220
And we need to specify the component which marks we need.

05:07.360 --> 05:12.400
Basically this line will mark the component which will be shown

05:16.350 --> 05:24.840
just specify the code component here but the account component will be displayed within the app component.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.140
So it's kind of a nested thing.

05:29.500 --> 05:38.200
Component count component displays a comma here and now we're going to do something.

05:38.410 --> 05:42.410
Oh whoa.

05:44.610 --> 05:45.570
Need this.

05:45.620 --> 05:46.290
Excellent.

05:46.550 --> 05:47.960
And now we're going to do something new.

05:47.960 --> 05:56.210
So we're going to specify children here and these children will be basically the sub sub routes of this

05:56.270 --> 05:57.290
route.

06:00.750 --> 06:01.790
So children

06:09.190 --> 06:10.180
should be

06:14.740 --> 06:15.210
set

06:23.810 --> 06:24.330
component.

06:24.360 --> 06:24.620
OK.

06:24.630 --> 06:35.130
So one will be for the list of accounts and the other one will be to create an account of Perth

06:41.830 --> 06:42.290
the

06:50.080 --> 07:00.910
component a Cobar here and what we see over here and now we need a third one and the third one will

07:00.940 --> 07:06.590
be the default one when you basically type in the slash accounts.

07:06.820 --> 07:10.810
So where will the redirect occur.

07:10.810 --> 07:14.020
So it needs to go somewhere or it can't go nowhere.

07:14.530 --> 07:26.280
So we're just going to place like this empty can redirect to the default one I'm going to see that that's

07:26.280 --> 07:34.270
going to be list K so I'm still getting a red flag for some strange reason.

07:34.290 --> 07:37.940
I mean just go ahead and fix that quick real fast.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.020
There we go.

07:39.530 --> 07:42.330
So that's the that's the thing that we need to do.

07:42.680 --> 07:50.800
And look when you list in combination with the cons basically it looks like this.

07:50.840 --> 07:59.320
So account slash list when this is typed into the onto the screen.

07:59.610 --> 08:02.700
That's what accounts slash list.

08:02.720 --> 08:08.820
When this is typed into the RL address bar along with the Along with the rest of the address before

08:08.820 --> 08:12.980
this which is basically the address the domain of the site.

08:13.010 --> 08:17.840
You will go to the list when you do slash create you go to create.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.860
And when you UPS

08:23.780 --> 08:30.430
when you just do desk accounts then you go to the list you're automatically redirected.

08:32.550 --> 08:40.310
I am behaving in a very strange way today with these random keyboard strikes.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.620
OK so that would be it as far as this file is concerned.

08:44.630 --> 08:52.900
It just needs a semi-colon at the end and a to press control less to actually save it.

08:52.910 --> 08:57.140
Now this has become far more portable.

08:57.140 --> 09:04.600
And the next thing we all need to do is readjust our app dot routes dot ts.

09:05.030 --> 09:11.380
So where is it data.

09:11.480 --> 09:11.710
Yes.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.940
OK there we go.

09:15.030 --> 09:20.760
This is the file which we will need to modify a little but so nothing.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.410
Nothing too drastic.

09:22.410 --> 09:28.340
So this line will basically need to go.

09:28.900 --> 09:35.260
Well actually I'm going to rather instead just modified Prout's as

09:39.680 --> 09:41.380
outs and from

09:45.120 --> 09:45.640
canim

09:48.300 --> 09:49.300
routes.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.080
OK.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.260
So this should be correct.

09:54.890 --> 10:04.430
Next up we're going to need to go ahead and delete this because this is a go away and this is no longer

10:04.520 --> 10:07.580
being defined here in this fashion.

10:09.390 --> 10:12.930
And prouder providers of stays the same.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.340
Now there is only one thing of importance here.

10:17.340 --> 10:24.560
One key thing that looks that will look a little bit weird counter-protests.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.350
So what did I just do here.

10:27.540 --> 10:35.030
First of all I have a some sort of variable route's here and I have some sort of variable route's here

10:35.040 --> 10:39.730
so they both have the same names and I would like to use this one.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.120
The contents of this one.

10:41.120 --> 10:47.290
Here how can I do that when there will be conflict between the names of the variables.

10:47.370 --> 10:52.810
Will they simply import routes as something else under a different name.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.660
You import it under a different name.

10:54.810 --> 10:59.670
So I have imported it under the name of account routes and there you go.

10:59.700 --> 11:06.980
Sure enough I have used that here but I have also specified the three dots since route's here is a type

11:06.980 --> 11:13.560
product config and it's an array and the same applies for this one here.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.220
This is base.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.900
This is an array.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.590
I don't want to import an array into an array.

11:19.590 --> 11:28.890
I want to take the elements of this array which are its routes and I want to take those routes and put

11:28.890 --> 11:33.510
them here into the into this into this array.

11:33.510 --> 11:39.690
So in order to do that and you type in three dots the name of the variable and this will pool the elements

11:39.690 --> 11:41.730
of the array and place them into here.

11:41.730 --> 11:47.850
It won't actually pull the array itself as an array rather instead it will pool the elements of the

11:47.850 --> 11:52.360
array and place them here so I get a listing of routes.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.220
This is I didn't there was no need for me to do it this way.

11:55.290 --> 12:00.570
But I believe it is something of importance that you should know that you can import variables under

12:00.570 --> 12:03.270
different names as on bigger projects.

12:03.270 --> 12:09.860
It is inevitable that the names of the variables will be will come to be in a state of collision or

12:09.860 --> 12:15.300
they will overlap one another and no you won't be able to change them in the other file because the

12:15.300 --> 12:23.070
other file is managed by a different person and you don't have rights to modify it but you do depend

12:23.070 --> 12:23.430
on it.

12:23.430 --> 12:32.250
So you need to manage with these small tricks anyway going to bid you farewell and hope to see you in

12:32.250 --> 12:33.270
the follow up.
