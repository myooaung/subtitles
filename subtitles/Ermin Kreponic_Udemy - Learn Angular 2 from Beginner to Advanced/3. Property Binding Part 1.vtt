00:00.480 --> 00:09.450
OK so once again you have this code in front of you that I've typed out and your mail is also up.

00:09.450 --> 00:18.390
So after component outage the amount and update component dot ts ts and HD and now you will have this

00:18.390 --> 00:24.750
code either right under the electors in the download section or you will have it on guitar or somewhere

00:24.750 --> 00:25.020
else.

00:25.020 --> 00:28.780
I will of course you will be notified of that.

00:28.860 --> 00:34.250
But in any case it's easy to copy paste the code the finished code and run it yourselves.

00:34.260 --> 00:37.450
That is the worst thing that you can do for yourselves.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.490
So not for me that is the worst thing that you can do for yourself.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.330
Why.

00:41.670 --> 00:44.880
Well because you will learn very little to nothing.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.460
The best thing that you can do is write the code as you go.

00:48.480 --> 00:56.480
As I explain things and alter it so alter it and see how it behave or how it behaves when modified.

00:56.910 --> 00:59.570
So that is the very best thing that you can do for yourselves.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.650
So don't even do it you will have the code.

01:01.650 --> 01:07.290
Please don't just copy paste that as I said not for me but for yourself for your own sake so that you

01:07.290 --> 01:08.760
would learn more.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.020
Because if you copy paste it and if you think that you understand that and if you didn't try it or modified

01:13.020 --> 01:15.180
it or take that in your cells.

01:15.210 --> 01:19.800
Trust me no matter what you think you will have learned very little yet.

01:19.950 --> 01:26.240
And since you're already watching the story Ole's at least make the best use out of them that you can.

01:26.940 --> 01:33.420
So that being said the app that can put a dot TS is pretty much the same.

01:33.450 --> 01:37.080
A few things have been altered and added some things have been deleted.

01:37.200 --> 01:42.370
So I will just go over the changes so as not to repeat myself over and over again.

01:42.690 --> 01:46.530
So we will begin from this line as this is the very first new thing that we have added.

01:46.530 --> 01:51.580
So this is pretty much the same as including templates one line up above.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.780
It is also possible to include it.

01:54.030 --> 01:57.190
You are well but we will talk about that later.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.100
What we did here

02:02.280 --> 02:12.760
we basically stated that the element with class Balue dash B.G. will have blue background color.

02:12.810 --> 02:21.300
So this is just for style which we will be able to use later on along our merry way so we won't actually

02:21.390 --> 02:23.740
be using this here.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.410
We will be using this in the DML file.

02:27.420 --> 02:36.230
So as you can see down below so the element input will have us blue dash B.G. and element input.

02:36.270 --> 02:42.080
Again another element input will have specified background color but this is not related.

02:42.150 --> 02:49.250
The is here so blue B.G. will have it and therefore it will be capable of becoming blue.

02:50.430 --> 02:56.080
But whether or not it will be blue that that is something that we will configure here in the TS file.

02:56.400 --> 03:02.150
So let's go down below into the class app component.

03:02.490 --> 03:06.220
And this has remained the same so no changes have been done in this line.

03:06.330 --> 03:10.860
But if we go down below we have a nother property here.

03:11.100 --> 03:17.580
So it says Hide email of type Boolean equals by default to true.

03:17.580 --> 03:21.050
So it is initialized to true straight away.

03:21.090 --> 03:27.930
Now this will either hide the email so test that test dot com or not.

03:27.930 --> 03:29.760
So if it's true it will hide it.

03:29.760 --> 03:36.210
If it's false it will not hide it or vice versa depending on the logic that we create down below and

03:36.210 --> 03:38.460
in DML code as well.

03:40.180 --> 03:44.390
Not logic NHT of LHD I will just set it how we want it to be displayed.

03:44.410 --> 03:46.080
But the logic itself is always great.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.010
It will be created here.

03:48.390 --> 03:53.130
Another boolean will be disabled input so will create a boolean.

03:53.140 --> 03:59.260
We will be able to utilize which which we will be able to state whether the input has been enabled or

03:59.320 --> 03:59.930
disabled.

03:59.950 --> 04:07.300
Bolinas are types which can basically be true or false down below.

04:07.320 --> 04:14.730
We have a method called is is disabled which again takes no arguments and it has a return type Boolean.

04:14.880 --> 04:21.730
So this will actual This method will turn the disabled input value.

04:22.020 --> 04:29.160
So the value of the disabled input so in this case it will actually be false so it will return false.

04:29.180 --> 04:37.890
Now is blue so this will determine whether the color will the color of the element will be blue or not.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.270
And this year is actually a screen which we will pass stading which color we would like the element

04:44.270 --> 04:46.830
to be so red blue green.

04:47.030 --> 04:47.860
I don't know how many.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.950
How many colors can you actually use when they are hard coded in terms of names.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.440
But it doesn't matter I mean you have a list that somebody can find it.

04:56.450 --> 04:59.120
In our case we will use a red anyway.

04:59.690 --> 05:03.200
This is maybe not used that often anyway.

05:03.500 --> 05:09.170
And down below we have our interface which we have defined previously.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.140
So I've only went over the new things here.

05:13.310 --> 05:19.420
Now let's go to the app component dot HD M-L and see what on earth is going on here.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.510
So there are quite a bit of new things here and we're going to go over them.

05:23.510 --> 05:29.200
Let me just separate this with this.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.950
Would it enter these entries that I'm typing in.

05:31.970 --> 05:35.410
They have no effect on the code of whatsoever.

05:35.420 --> 05:39.750
This is purely for our convenience so that we can see things better.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.810
They do not matter to the machine at all.

05:41.810 --> 05:43.500
It doesn't speed at all.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.950
They are completely irrelevant.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.920
So first off we can begin from Dave.

05:47.940 --> 05:55.100
Now Dave is an HDMI element which is used for separating other elements from other elements.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.370
So to see it generally used for separation.

05:59.630 --> 06:06.890
So you have this part here which is separated from this part here so you can specify certain properties

06:06.890 --> 06:13.970
for this part separately and then you can create another div for this part down below which will have

06:14.060 --> 06:15.350
different properties.

06:15.380 --> 06:20.780
For example they can use different See assessors or is acting different CSSA files or something like

06:20.780 --> 06:20.990
that.

06:21.020 --> 06:25.570
Different style different styles or something similar.

06:25.580 --> 06:30.670
Anyway this line is the same so this has already been explained but here you have something new here

06:30.680 --> 06:41.470
we will perform property binding this part here is property binding we will bind the property hidden.

06:41.520 --> 06:47.310
So you have a property hidden the of the element which is the paragraph element.

06:47.310 --> 06:48.660
So it begins.

06:48.690 --> 06:52.300
It begins here and it ends here.

06:53.400 --> 07:04.680
And this element will have has a property hidden and then we will use hide email to basically bind the

07:04.680 --> 07:09.090
property of to basically perform property binding here.

07:09.090 --> 07:12.410
So let me just go over what that actually means.

07:14.750 --> 07:22.790
So you have hide email from app component atya So it's somewhere around here.

07:22.820 --> 07:23.710
Yep there we go.

07:24.050 --> 07:28.920
And at the moment it's configured to true its value is configured to true.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.110
So if we go back here when will be equal to crew.

07:34.520 --> 07:42.230
So we will want the email to be actually hidden and that is what we are doing here.

07:42.230 --> 07:46.900
So if if Heidy mail is equal to true then we will not see the settlement.

07:46.910 --> 07:53.480
This entire element so this entire paragraph will not be visible but if it is false then we will be

07:53.480 --> 07:54.590
able to see it.

07:54.590 --> 08:01.760
So whether the Heidy mail in the component is true or false on that on that the display of this paragraph

08:01.760 --> 08:09.430
will depend whether this paragraph is actually hidden or not down below we have input.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.240
So whether we want the input to be disabled or not.

08:12.240 --> 08:17.700
So you right in the Cur-Lee in the block and the block brackets I believe they're called like that are

08:17.700 --> 08:25.560
just brackets you but you bind it to disabled input and you state where the disabled input is true or

08:25.560 --> 08:26.550
false.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.720
So if it is true Imparcial be disabled.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.240
And if it is false a put in parts shall not be disabled.

08:33.510 --> 08:39.690
So you have some sort of an input field where you can type in some text and the placeholder the initial

08:39.690 --> 08:40.520
value will be.

08:40.540 --> 08:41.790
Enter your text.

08:41.790 --> 08:46.740
So whether or not you can actually enter the text here will depend on the state of this boolean value

08:47.020 --> 08:51.030
in the component so disabled input boolean.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.740
Currently it's equal to false meaning that we can actually input the text.

08:55.740 --> 09:01.290
So if the Seybold is equal to true then we can't input text and if disabled is equal to false then we

09:01.290 --> 09:05.610
actually can and will go over these things in all likelihood one more time when I show them how they

09:05.610 --> 09:10.540
actually look like on the site itself down below it immediately.

09:10.890 --> 09:14.050
You have again input the table.

09:14.070 --> 09:18.870
This is the same as before except here we're using the return value of the method.

09:18.870 --> 09:23.980
Now what we're doing when we are performing property binding like this whatever it is.

09:23.980 --> 09:31.320
But between these quote marks shall be evaluated meaning that this function will be called and its return

09:31.320 --> 09:35.660
value will be taken its return value is basically a boolean.

09:36.150 --> 09:38.010
So is disabled.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.380
And that's the function.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.240
That's the method.

09:41.370 --> 09:45.250
And then it will return disabled input which is a boolean.

09:45.330 --> 09:46.390
Right above it.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.290
Meaning that it will return the value false.

09:49.980 --> 09:55.050
So these two statements are practically identical except one is using a boolean directly.

09:55.050 --> 09:58.750
Another one is using the return value of this method.

10:00.050 --> 10:08.440
And down below I just put these lines and Flunder practically identical.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.100
But you can also set the value.

10:11.660 --> 10:17.540
So you have a value and then you have a placeholder how that works is best was literally the best thing

10:17.540 --> 10:18.410
to do I can.

10:18.650 --> 10:25.740
Best thing I can do is demonstrate it to you because you have the value and you have the placeholder.

10:25.940 --> 10:31.480
So when you when you see it on the site you will see how that works in a in a moment.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.320
So let's just let's just leave this part for now.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.520
I will explain it when we actually see it on the site down below.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.590
Immediately you have another input field.

10:39.590 --> 10:48.470
It says class dot blue dash Biji and then it is equal to is blue B.G. so is blue Biji is yet another

10:48.640 --> 10:50.020
Boullion we have here.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.240
I just find it there we go.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.850
So is blue Biji.

10:54.870 --> 10:56.570
Currently it's equal to true.

10:56.790 --> 11:07.940
So there with this element will actually have a color blue Sozzi you just scroll in my notes a little

11:07.940 --> 11:09.010
bit.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.700
So the stuff for the type.

11:12.710 --> 11:17.770
Anyway we can set the Vout.

11:18.550 --> 11:19.990
We can set the value here.

11:20.020 --> 11:25.510
Yes but I'm just looking for this plan in case I committed to actually state something.

11:25.510 --> 11:33.280
So anyway if it's blue B.G. the Boullion indie component if it's true the element input will have this

11:33.280 --> 11:40.240
class blue Bluebeard's so it will actually have this class in it and it will be blue if this is set

11:40.240 --> 11:41.000
to false.

11:41.020 --> 11:44.340
It will not have this class and it will not be blue.

11:44.350 --> 11:45.430
What will it be I have.

11:45.430 --> 11:49.540
It doesn't really matter but it won't be blue in any case because we didn't configure it to be blue

11:49.540 --> 11:52.870
through our bullion in our code.

11:52.900 --> 12:01.570
Now down below the final line of the code of the HD M-L code is basically this is similar as before

12:01.960 --> 12:03.870
but this is four styles.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.360
So we just add colors to a string in the component so this is what we are.

12:08.410 --> 12:16.810
This is where we're going to be utilizing the string B.G. color currently set to red.

12:16.930 --> 12:20.200
So it says basically B.G. color and this is red.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.430
So the background color will be set to red.

12:24.760 --> 12:31.970
OK so now let's go ahead and minimize this and open up our site so this is how it should look like anyway.

12:32.830 --> 12:40.130
And you can send kinda send down let me just see where we are.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.800
OK.

12:40.910 --> 12:44.500
I also forgot to explain these E-M tags.

12:45.660 --> 12:49.860
That's something I have actually missed and didn't actually stated it.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.270
Probably something that you all ready.

12:53.290 --> 12:56.820
No but it's not really I mean that important.

12:56.850 --> 13:05.930
E-M are the M-L tags which marked Italic letters so the letters will be like tilted to the right.

13:05.970 --> 13:08.950
So to say where should be anyway.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.010
OK.

13:11.030 --> 13:13.470
So the first thing that we have is paragraph Hello.

13:13.490 --> 13:15.620
And then it Pooles the current user.

13:15.710 --> 13:16.310
That's fine.

13:16.310 --> 13:18.070
Hello test.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.830
And then this paragraph here.

13:21.010 --> 13:21.610
Hmm.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.660
Do you see it on the screen.

13:23.660 --> 13:26.030
No you do not see it on the screen.

13:26.200 --> 13:33.210
So Heidi Heidi male Boullion is actually equal to true therefore hidden is equal to true.

13:33.230 --> 13:37.080
Therefore this element is actually not visible.

13:37.090 --> 13:39.790
But here let's go ahead and make an alteration.

13:40.000 --> 13:48.380
So if I just change this true to false and save it to press control as to save it and it's going to

13:48.680 --> 13:53.420
go ahead and load it just give it a little bit of time probably is going to be faster for you because

13:53.420 --> 13:55.220
you're in the physical machine.

13:55.310 --> 14:02.890
So it says your email is test at test dot com as you can see from the e-mail code.

14:02.990 --> 14:08.540
Your email is and then current user dot e-mail it pulls it and says stop at test dot com so you can

14:08.540 --> 14:10.580
see that the letters are tilted to the right.

14:10.580 --> 14:15.610
So taluk letters or something like it taluk perhaps not a tower but something like italics or they're

14:15.620 --> 14:20.990
just there was just a slight tilt to the right when you want to emphasize something like bolding the

14:20.990 --> 14:25.010
letters are doing something similar to that.

14:25.300 --> 14:25.810
OK.

14:25.840 --> 14:32.520
Now this is where we're going to call the Tauriel and then I will go over deith and show them once more

14:32.530 --> 14:37.060
and I will actually show them on the site to actually demonstrate how they function and what sort of

14:37.060 --> 14:42.500
changes are once you conduct some changes here how they are reflected on the site and what each of them

14:42.520 --> 14:46.870
will actually show what each one of these lines does to the display of the site.

14:46.870 --> 14:49.810
But since I'm running a little bit short on time I'm going to do this in part to.
