WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:01.830
OK we'll come back.

00:01.950 --> 00:08.770
So today we're going to go ahead and dwell on the subject of routing and navigation.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.510
So what is routeing.

00:10.590 --> 00:18.720
Well you're basically tying certain contents of our side to certain rails and navigation Well basic

00:18.720 --> 00:24.660
site navigation I mean movement within the site for example you click on a button and it takes you somewhere

00:24.660 --> 00:25.170
else.

00:25.170 --> 00:30.180
Click on a link on the site and it takes you somewhere else on that particular site or just moving from

00:30.180 --> 00:32.550
one place to the other on the site.

00:32.940 --> 00:38.850
So now what we shall do is split the home page and the account page.

00:38.850 --> 00:43.920
So thus far we have this account page but we would like to have a landing page which would be a home

00:43.920 --> 00:48.780
page and then we will have the account page separately.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.940
What will we need to achieve this.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.750
Well first off we will require a home component.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.140
This will be the component that will be shown on the default route.

00:58.140 --> 01:05.160
So when you just open up this site with the basic address of the site that will load and then we need

01:05.160 --> 01:10.470
the account component which will be separate from this that will show the accounts as they are now as

01:10.470 --> 01:11.700
you can see them on the site.

01:11.700 --> 01:19.290
Now you probably have a link or something like that that leads to the account page and the app component

01:19.380 --> 01:26.730
will basically display the base content and within it routed and we Tennet basically router will be

01:26.730 --> 01:29.340
inserting content on demand.

01:29.340 --> 01:35.230
So I don't know you have some sort of static content on every site like the nav bar and the footer.

01:35.430 --> 01:39.010
Those usually remain throughout all the sites that get loaded.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.040
And that's something that we will leave here as well to be the app component.

01:46.260 --> 01:55.280
And then in the end then but then within the app component site content will be uploaded via the router.

01:55.280 --> 02:01.570
OK so let's go ahead and do it and hopefully things will become clearer then.

02:01.620 --> 02:05.540
First off we're going to go ahead and move the app component.

02:05.570 --> 02:08.970
CSSA the M-L and D.S..

02:09.360 --> 02:15.920
So we're going to go ahead and cut this and go into the account and then paste it here

02:18.720 --> 02:20.650
case count.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.090
There we go.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.040
So we have pasted all three of them.

02:24.030 --> 02:27.150
Now let's go ahead and rename them

02:31.280 --> 02:43.310
rename and this will become a cow just substitute app with accounts sort of count and this one

02:50.140 --> 02:59.700
count and the final one.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.050
There we go.

03:01.370 --> 03:05.430
So that's all you need to do in terms of renaming and moving.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.540
Now we need to modify them to an extent.

03:09.620 --> 03:13.970
Now we need to go ahead and write

03:16.610 --> 03:20.060
one more.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.040
Sorry about that.

03:22.040 --> 03:31.380
Now we need to go ahead and just modify them we need to modify the DML and t s Ok.

03:31.470 --> 03:46.300
So the HD M-L we just need to delete certain things like come on from here like just go ahead and delete

03:46.360 --> 03:55.190
this and then down below we will just go ahead and delete this or just do a little bit of formatting.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.040
We can leave it like this.

03:59.420 --> 04:00.110
OK.

04:00.140 --> 04:06.590
Next up what we need to modify is the app component that D.S. And of course keep on saving the changes

04:08.690 --> 04:11.140
and app component.

04:11.170 --> 04:11.520
Yes.

04:11.540 --> 04:18.620
OK so you can see that the Pats have become in a valid case so let's just do some deleting.

04:18.710 --> 04:22.140
That's all that we need to really do here.

04:22.910 --> 04:28.450
And the paths will become valid again since we have been moving files around and renaming them

04:33.370 --> 04:40.790
k now just save it and let's go ahead and continue downwards.

04:40.900 --> 04:49.950
So here under selector this is not strictly mandatory but let's just type it in any way counts.

04:50.270 --> 04:52.750
And we're going to leave that there.

04:52.780 --> 04:59.500
So just go ahead and fix the path here so it's app app not here sorry.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.820
Template you are l.

05:01.030 --> 05:06.650
So app slash account slash

05:10.630 --> 05:19.320
account dot component that etched your metal and down below again pretty much the same thing.

05:21.210 --> 05:24.150
Can slash count.

05:24.470 --> 05:28.590
OK so we're just modifying the paths.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.830
And here we're going to just go ahead and we named this as well

05:35.830 --> 05:37.150
count.

05:37.430 --> 05:37.970
Excellent.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.550
So that would be it in terms of changes here.

05:41.590 --> 05:42.900
That's all we need to modify there.

05:42.910 --> 05:48.460
Now we need to go ahead and create a home folder inside the app folder.

05:48.470 --> 05:58.730
So inside the Apfel folder just go ahead and create a new folder and go ahead and name at home.

06:02.670 --> 06:11.890
And within the home folder we're going to need to create things for files.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.760
Or two files doesn't really matter.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.470
I'll just check my notes for that.

06:17.540 --> 06:23.090
And let's go ahead and type in home dot ups.

06:25.570 --> 06:36.900
Component dot D s and we're going to go ahead and create the new file which will be a whole dot

06:43.420 --> 06:46.740
component and HDMI.

06:47.140 --> 06:47.470
OK.

06:47.480 --> 06:55.630
And now we need to go ahead and create the app component TS and app component dot HD or else since we

06:55.630 --> 06:56.710
have moved from

07:00.840 --> 07:08.010
dog TS and we're going to go ahead and create a new file here which will be

07:10.910 --> 07:16.340
pertinent dot h t m l.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.060
There we go.

07:17.130 --> 07:26.010
So we have recreated this one and this one which we have moved and renamed and we have created these

07:26.010 --> 07:28.680
two new files as well.

07:28.680 --> 07:34.590
So we need to basically populate them with some sort of content and that is something that we can go

07:34.590 --> 07:36.660
ahead and proceed to do.

07:37.020 --> 07:44.850
Now the home component that HD email see this one come on.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.570
Yep.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.890
So this is fairly short you just type.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.140
I'm just going to go ahead and type it and I'm not going to take it from my notes.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.740
I'm just going to tape here.

07:53.020 --> 07:54.010
Well

07:56.410 --> 08:13.800
welcome to personal finance and this is going to be one and down below typing in three this is.

08:14.460 --> 08:19.960
This is the home component's.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.680
Poland just put a dot there shall we.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.120
Three.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.330
And there you go.

08:27.330 --> 08:30.630
So that's all we really need to do there now.

08:30.670 --> 08:39.270
The TS is slightly more complex so we'll need to add a few more things here so import will just need

08:39.270 --> 08:41.980
to conduct our standard imports.

08:42.900 --> 08:48.470
So this is nothing new that we haven't done before.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.800
Basically So these are all the things that we have done before.

08:56.420 --> 09:02.740
New keyboards hate changing keyboards angular slash core.

09:02.750 --> 09:07.880
Do you remember Angella core from before one we've actually conducted the updates.

09:12.640 --> 09:19.760
From K and now we're going to go ahead and type in app component

09:22.710 --> 09:31.050
so we need a simpler selector and we're going to do it at home.

09:32.350 --> 09:37.310
And template you are also played or l

09:40.220 --> 09:41.460
be kind.

09:41.650 --> 09:49.120
Let's maintain consistency with our coding style slash Home

09:52.840 --> 09:55.670
Rule just a bit of a spelling mistake there.

09:56.290 --> 10:01.040
Bomb dot component at each DML

10:03.950 --> 10:04.840
and that's it.

10:04.870 --> 10:15.830
They're just going to go ahead and export class home component and we're going to leave it empty like

10:15.830 --> 10:16.460
this.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.050
Later on we will be populated with additional things.

10:23.750 --> 10:30.830
OK so now we have app component that we have our component of TS.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.160
Let's go ahead and recycle some of the code from here.

10:35.160 --> 10:39.800
Let's go ahead and capitis and go into the app component.

10:39.890 --> 10:40.260
Yes.

10:40.260 --> 10:49.130
Save us a little bit of typing so selector shall be changed to my dash app template.

10:49.140 --> 10:56.470
You are shall be changed to app that component out HDMI.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.490
And we all need to add the tile your el

11:04.740 --> 11:07.490
or else.

11:07.560 --> 11:23.340
So here it's going to be up slash up to component part C S S K and export Class AB components which

11:23.340 --> 11:26.330
just need to rename.

11:26.550 --> 11:34.540
Now you just need to read agent to app component there we go.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.870
So just save it.

11:35.910 --> 11:38.390
And this one needs to be saved.

11:38.410 --> 11:39.440
Well I couldn't save it.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.740
My apologies for that.

11:40.870 --> 11:43.080
And I think that should be it.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.750
Have we modified this one.

11:45.750 --> 11:49.100
So let me just go ahead and check my notes.

11:49.100 --> 11:52.140
Yep we need to modify this one as well.

11:52.140 --> 11:55.200
So what we need to do is delete this.

11:55.440 --> 12:01.500
Well maybe that can basically leave it let's just delete this part that I've tagged for myself but I

12:01.500 --> 12:05.130
don't think it should have any problems either way.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.680
So control less save.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.560
And that's it.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.960
So these are older modifications that you need to do in preparation for the separation of the home page

12:13.440 --> 12:19.020
from the account page going to go ahead and bid you farewell here and we shall see each other in the

12:19.080 --> 12:20.340
follow up story or hopefully.
