WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:00.660
OK.

00:00.690 --> 00:01.750
Welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:08.290
Now for all the Linux users out there I'm going to go ahead and show you how to create the same set

00:08.290 --> 00:10.060
up on Linux.

00:10.140 --> 00:17.690
So I have one virtual machine of windows here where we've finished the configuration and I have another

00:17.700 --> 00:19.840
virtual machine of Linux.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.690
Here again it's a fresh install.

00:22.710 --> 00:27.150
So I'm just going to go out and expand it across the screen and we're going to do pretty much the same

00:27.150 --> 00:27.590
thing.

00:27.630 --> 00:33.810
Now if you are not using Linux obviously you can skip the story as I'm doing set up videos for all three

00:33.810 --> 00:35.930
operating systems in all likelihood.

00:35.940 --> 00:41.340
So just watch the ones that you need so if you're a Windows user watch the ones for windows linux user

00:41.400 --> 00:42.480
watch the ones for Linux.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.980
If you're a Mac user watch the ones for Mac.

00:45.030 --> 00:45.770
Simple as that.

00:45.780 --> 00:46.980
No big deal.

00:47.100 --> 00:52.680
You don't need to watch all three of them it's really rather pointless as the set up procedure is pretty

00:52.680 --> 00:55.300
much the same I will be doing pretty much the same things.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.630
So go ahead and open up your web browser.

00:57.630 --> 01:03.870
I am using Fedora Linux distribution so it might be different if using a Debian based distribution but

01:03.960 --> 01:05.040
I am a fedora user.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.750
My main operating system is Fedora.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.190
So I figured I would show you.

01:08.340 --> 01:12.840
If you're wondering why am I using your virtual machine if my main operating system is Fedora.

01:13.140 --> 01:19.080
Well I'm not going to install these packages on my main machine as I'm not going to be doing development.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.600
My main machine and I don't really feel like cleaning them up later on

01:26.210 --> 01:29.630
as you can see this should work.

01:29.630 --> 01:30.350
Yep there you go.

01:30.350 --> 01:33.460
As you can see this is my Linux desktop.

01:34.190 --> 01:42.320
It's just switching between them so one machine can go on one desktop and another machine can go on

01:42.320 --> 01:47.650
a different desktop and then you can just roll them over with say.

01:47.650 --> 01:52.390
Move this to desktop too and leave this here.

01:54.290 --> 02:05.210
Case let just do this and then I can just go ahead and roll over to Fedora like this.

02:05.390 --> 02:06.740
That's really convenient.

02:06.740 --> 02:12.740
This is a really nice Linux feature where you can split your desktop apart and have multiple desktops

02:12.740 --> 02:16.140
and spin them around as the sides of a cube.

02:16.190 --> 02:18.730
But anyway that's completely besides the point.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.720
I'm just going to go ahead and expand this virtual machine across the screen here.

02:21.730 --> 02:24.910
Just a cool feature that I want to show you.

02:24.920 --> 02:33.980
And now I have successfully managed to lose my notes on the other screen had me just let me just go

02:33.980 --> 02:36.580
ahead and bring them back quickly.

02:40.150 --> 02:42.780
This to talk to please as well.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.110
Axon.

02:47.120 --> 02:47.700
There we go.

02:49.320 --> 02:55.560
My desktop switch on all screens so I need to move my notes desktop to on my other screen the one you

02:55.560 --> 02:56.920
cannot see at the moment.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.440
OK so let's go ahead and expand this across.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.810
We need to go to the Adam sites or just type in Adam favorite search engine.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.170
As before.

03:07.170 --> 03:12.770
Go ahead and open it up here and it says download does that for Debian users.

03:12.770 --> 03:18.930
If you're a debian user and if you're using a Debian based distro or Debian go ahead and download this

03:18.930 --> 03:19.200
one.

03:19.200 --> 03:28.930
If using the Redhat based distro like Fedora is go ahead and download this one and just go ahead and

03:28.930 --> 03:31.470
click on Save file.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.460
It shouldn't take long it's fairly fast.

03:34.460 --> 03:37.680
You will also be needing node Aegeus.

03:37.710 --> 03:41.610
Now you have no JS and the official repositories but it's a little bit of an older version so we're

03:41.610 --> 03:43.770
not going to be using that one now.

03:43.770 --> 03:44.700
There is a difference here.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.120
Need to go into Downloads.

03:47.770 --> 03:55.000
And then scroll down and installing no js via packet manager.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.460
So go ahead and click on that and now you have instructions for various Linux distributions.

04:00.460 --> 04:05.380
Mine is Fedora again so I'm just going to go ahead and click on that one and there will if yours is

04:05.380 --> 04:05.810
different.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.260
Go ahead and click on a different one.

04:08.530 --> 04:11.980
And now I can go ahead and download it from here.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.990
You have no geus version 6.

04:14.020 --> 04:20.300
No I want the stable version so I'm going to go ahead and go for Forte just copy this command control

04:20.310 --> 04:23.420
See open up a terminal

04:33.080 --> 04:34.230
OK.

04:36.140 --> 04:37.180
Let me just do this.

04:37.220 --> 04:37.950
OK.

04:37.970 --> 04:44.360
So control control shift me is to paste into terminal and control shift C is to copy in the terminal

04:44.920 --> 04:48.480
press enter and it should install it.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.350
Ah ok ok ok ok.

04:53.370 --> 04:53.890
I'm sorry.

04:53.910 --> 04:58.220
You need to become root so just type in SU and then type in your password here.

04:58.350 --> 05:01.220
You won't see any password being typed out.

05:01.230 --> 05:02.970
That's just that's just the Unix way.

05:02.970 --> 05:09.140
So that's somebody looking behind you will not be able to see the password control shift we press enter

05:11.300 --> 05:12.240
and let it run.

05:12.250 --> 05:18.130
Now OK I seem to me seem to be missing the GCC.

05:18.140 --> 05:22.240
No big deal it's telling me it's.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.010
Yeah.

05:23.060 --> 05:26.860
Just go ahead and install it.

05:27.100 --> 05:27.830
No big deal.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.440
Just run this and one down below.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.730
Copy.

05:32.880 --> 05:38.340
Go ahead control shift the DNF.

05:38.680 --> 05:48.660
And I'm also going to be needing this control shift see control shift the these are some additional

05:48.660 --> 05:50.480
packages that are required.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.600
So just go ahead install them as well.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.170
It shouldn't take too long.

05:57.230 --> 06:00.220
The installation from the repo's is fairly fast.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.890
I can tell you that much.

06:01.910 --> 06:03.540
Now go to your Downloads folder.

06:05.450 --> 06:12.610
Wherever it might be on your machine and you will see it says Adam that 686 64 RPM if you're using a

06:12.620 --> 06:14.690
32 bit machine that's also fine.

06:14.780 --> 06:16.080
Just double click on it.

06:17.380 --> 06:23.230
There's also a way of doing this by the terminal but I figured it'd be simpler to you to do it faggery.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.760
So just just wait for it.

06:25.920 --> 06:32.770
The apair might be a bit slow because it's waiting for this to finish.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.640
You you generally can't install two packages at the same time by the package manager so that's kind.

06:39.670 --> 06:42.180
That's a bit of a bummer.

06:42.210 --> 06:50.870
So just go ahead and click on install here provide the root to your root password plus click on authenticate

06:52.530 --> 06:53.590
shouldn't take too long.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.350
Or it might.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.040
I don't know it took a lot of time in windows.

06:59.060 --> 07:04.160
Keep in mind that these two virtual machines of Windows and Linux they have they have been allocated

07:04.190 --> 07:09.720
exactly the same amount of resources on the very same hardware.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.750
So they're both running on the same hardware.

07:13.880 --> 07:18.770
While this is going on just let it run let it install and while that is happening go back to Firefox

07:19.980 --> 07:24.510
and Dirigo it has been installed while it's way faster here.

07:25.350 --> 07:29.220
Go ahead and type in get hub because we need to go over to get help

07:34.310 --> 07:39.540
type in angular slash.

07:39.820 --> 07:44.980
Quick Start so angular slash QuickStart.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.450
The first one.

07:46.450 --> 07:49.070
Click on it download zip.

07:49.100 --> 07:55.100
Click on that don't open with just save file and click on OK.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.340
It is the QuickStart.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.600
Adam you need to go ahead and click on.

08:03.300 --> 08:07.340
Well you need QuickStart the is already being installed.

08:09.480 --> 08:15.100
But we can go ahead and click on Kickstarter as well just so that you can see it need it sees zip zip

08:15.100 --> 08:15.490
file.

08:15.490 --> 08:23.740
We need to actually extract up and I'm going to go ahead and extract it to an arrow.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.580
Let's let's ask let's extract it to document.

08:26.710 --> 08:34.680
Let's let's have some continuity let's don't let's extract it to desktop as before extraction completed

08:34.690 --> 08:35.540
successfully.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.680
I'm going to go ahead and click on QUEST.

08:37.690 --> 08:40.330
No need to do anything else there.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.950
Now go ahead and start Adam

08:45.500 --> 08:48.980
because it won't start in an automated fashion here like it will in Windows.

08:49.100 --> 08:49.680
Wow.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.540
This is a lot faster.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.610
Actually you know what.

08:54.650 --> 09:00.260
Go ahead and see both instructional videos for Windows and for Linux just to compare the speed at which

09:00.650 --> 09:02.180
everything is happening.

09:02.180 --> 09:07.730
Both machines are running on exactly the same hardware and both virtual machines have been exact allotted

09:08.150 --> 09:11.600
exactly the same amount of resources.

09:11.660 --> 09:16.380
So go ahead and click on open project and then on open project here as well.

09:17.320 --> 09:25.280
And then go to desktop QuickStart and click select it and then quick click on OK.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.600
And there you go it's actually opened up.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.070
It's loaded ready to go.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.950
No no big deal there.

09:35.960 --> 09:44.150
Now the next thing that we need to do is go back to our terminal and here we're going to go ahead and

09:44.240 --> 09:46.350
enter.

09:46.940 --> 09:50.640
We're going to CD over two desk top of the current user.

09:50.750 --> 10:01.730
So home if you're wondering how I'm typing fast I'm just like H then press tab and the user is AUPs

10:02.090 --> 10:10.410
the user is test and then desk and then tab again and it's going to be like QuickStart master.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.030
OK I'm here.

10:12.270 --> 10:20.620
And don't you need to be in the QuickStart folder the need to type in NPM install purely doubt that

10:20.620 --> 10:21.660
it's going to work without root.

10:21.670 --> 10:24.840
But let's just have a look and see shall we.

10:25.210 --> 10:30.900
Guess we get a warning we get a warning Don't worry about those as long as it's not an error.

10:31.000 --> 10:31.900
Good to go

10:35.480 --> 10:38.460
oh my god this is like so much faster here.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.860
Just do.

10:42.030 --> 10:43.550
Out of curiosity just check.

10:43.560 --> 10:49.920
Check out the windows setup videos and compare the speed at which everything happened.

10:49.920 --> 10:55.630
I really want you to see I mean there's no technical reason why you should see but I would just like

10:55.630 --> 10:57.360
you to do it anyway.

10:57.610 --> 10:57.870
OK.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.680
I don't see any errors.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.040
None that my eye can detect anyway.

11:02.170 --> 11:07.300
And now when it's typed in and P NPM start

11:12.040 --> 11:13.830
loading loading.

11:13.990 --> 11:14.840
There you go.

11:15.340 --> 11:15.930
It's done.

11:15.940 --> 11:16.580
It's set.

11:16.600 --> 11:20.800
It says localhost which is the address and then colon which is.

11:20.840 --> 11:26.500
And then effort to call when you type in the port of.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.730
And then after the colon you just type in the port the port is three thousand.

11:30.730 --> 11:33.870
Now this is only accessible from this machine locally.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.100
This is not for outside access so don't worry you're not like opening up your machine to.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.480
God knows what.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.710
This is a local development server.

11:46.550 --> 11:52.730
Unless I don't know you have some other different settings with the router and the machine except right

11:52.720 --> 11:56.730
should be a local development server period.

11:57.320 --> 11:57.770
OK.

11:57.770 --> 12:04.640
Now that all of that is done we're going to go ahead and go back to Adam and we will need to install

12:04.730 --> 12:06.260
an add on.

12:06.260 --> 12:09.180
Go ahead and click on package's.

12:09.420 --> 12:15.400
Scroll down to settings view managed packages.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.820
Just give it to us.

12:16.910 --> 12:20.320
But find package by name and type in.

12:20.520 --> 12:29.480
Adam sorry not here where it says packages scroll down to install and then type in here

12:32.210 --> 12:40.940
add a dash type script click on package and let the search happen.

12:40.950 --> 12:42.960
It says here Adam typescript.

12:43.290 --> 12:47.500
The first one at the very first one and click on install.

12:47.610 --> 12:55.350
Now depending on the load on the server and all the other things that are in the process this might

12:55.470 --> 12:56.360
take a while.

12:56.370 --> 12:58.180
I can tell you that now.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.630
So this has nothing to do with your machine.

13:00.630 --> 13:03.840
It doesn't matter how fast or slow your machine is.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.720
I mean in some context I guess it does.

13:05.730 --> 13:08.460
But for a file of this size I guess it doesn't.

13:08.520 --> 13:13.710
The problem is that the server on the other side is either loaded or there's something going on.

13:13.740 --> 13:21.360
So and the time at which I am actually casting the store is probably the peak at the peak in terms of

13:21.450 --> 13:23.500
how many people are downloading it.

13:23.520 --> 13:29.700
So this might take a while on a Windows machine when I downloaded it like 15 20 minutes ago.

13:29.700 --> 13:35.730
It took maybe seven or eight minutes for the download to begin and wants to download began.

13:35.730 --> 13:40.870
Everything happened really fast but here apparently it happens straight away.

13:41.290 --> 13:46.560
Now it's installed now it's actually installing it and it's installed which is amazing.

13:47.050 --> 13:50.590
I'm like totally go and check out the windows to talk.

13:52.670 --> 13:53.250
OK.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.700
So that is all you really need to do.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.650
That is the entirety of the setup video for Linux.

13:59.790 --> 14:03.960
And we have our environments set up ready to go.

14:03.970 --> 14:07.750
Leave leave this running in the background.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.380
The developments are readers.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.540
We might do some.

14:12.600 --> 14:18.420
We might do some tuning and tweaking later on in terms of the layout of the development environment

14:18.840 --> 14:24.060
because we want to change either the font size or we want to do something like that to tweak it to our

14:24.060 --> 14:24.540
own needs.

14:24.540 --> 14:25.170
You can do that.

14:25.170 --> 14:26.790
Do some cosmetic changes.

14:26.820 --> 14:32.580
I will show you later on how you can do that and we will have an round up of this development environment

14:32.580 --> 14:41.280
I will show you where where what is how the environment works where the locations of various files where

14:41.280 --> 14:47.930
you can tune and tweak what things except Truslow in terms of cosmetics do whatever you want to not

14:47.930 --> 14:48.810
to your liking.

14:48.810 --> 14:55.410
I personally will increase the font sizes so that you can actually see things a lot better than in case

14:55.830 --> 15:00.190
I am going to go ahead and bid you farewell here and Im going to.

15:00.190 --> 15:00.730
And if you.

15:00.780 --> 15:07.050
And if you're a Linux user I would strongly recommend that you check out the windows tutorials as well.

15:07.080 --> 15:12.480
Not for any technical reasons as I said but just to see how much time it took for this to finish there

15:12.510 --> 15:15.460
and how much time it took for this to finish here.

15:15.990 --> 15:23.280
The procedure is pretty much exactly the same and the resources allocated to the both machines are pretty

15:23.280 --> 15:24.420
much exactly the same.

15:24.420 --> 15:29.680
Actually they are exactly the same and they are all running and they're both running on the same hardware.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.140
So bid you farewell.
