WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:02.010
Will come back.

00:02.010 --> 00:04.480
So we're going to start.

00:04.470 --> 00:10.400
We're going to slowly start talking about these files here that you see in the treeview.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.860
We'll see what they are for.

00:11.870 --> 00:12.460
What do you do.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.160
What is their purpose and what is the code within them.

00:17.190 --> 00:21.420
A lot of these files we will not use and for a very good reason.

00:21.420 --> 00:27.850
One of the prime examples of the fire of of a file that we are not going to use is the docker file.

00:27.860 --> 00:28.520
Why.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.300
Well because we don't really need to create containers if you know what doctor is great for you.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.970
If not feel free to look it up on the net.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.140
It's a very interesting new technology.

00:38.250 --> 00:43.620
But in any case we do not need to create actually docker files here at all.

00:43.620 --> 00:51.810
Doctors are like containers where you can contain a single application on your system but that's not

00:51.810 --> 00:53.200
the subject of today.

00:53.970 --> 00:58.680
Anyway as I said a lot of these files we won't be looking at because they don't really make sense for

00:58.680 --> 00:59.400
us now.

00:59.430 --> 01:06.480
Logical sense that is one of the files that doesn't make sense is package D'Argenton should be around

01:06.480 --> 01:07.000
here somewhere.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.120
Yep there we go.

01:08.430 --> 01:15.720
And this is the file that we are going to take a look at and that we're going to explain.

01:15.720 --> 01:22.890
So first of all you have let me just do this so that you can see it a little bit better.

01:22.890 --> 01:24.570
There you go.

01:24.570 --> 01:34.190
So over here you have packaged Our Jason and this is the NPM and no package manager file.

01:34.320 --> 01:39.060
This file contains the meta data about our project.

01:39.060 --> 01:47.970
Here you can find project name or name version and probably the most important thing of it all dependencies.

01:47.970 --> 01:54.920
You can also find dev dependencies that are all that are needed for the development of the project.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.240
Anyway the dependencies are down below.

01:59.280 --> 02:07.090
You can see them here and up there a pop up above you can see our scripts.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.220
So you have the start script.

02:09.380 --> 02:12.120
Do you remember when we typed in NPM start.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.730
Well this is what is being executed.

02:14.730 --> 02:21.690
You have the DSC typescript compiler and you have this one it's Basken currently.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.650
So what does it mean.

02:22.650 --> 02:25.410
What does what does this line stand for.

02:25.620 --> 02:33.960
Well the textbook compiler is started and then the you want to state that these two will be concurrent.

02:34.140 --> 02:40.150
So you will have the typescript compiler again which will watch for any changes and will recompile for

02:40.200 --> 02:49.750
those changes which will be taken by the light server and represented on the screen so to speak and

02:49.750 --> 02:52.330
down below you also have again other script.

02:52.350 --> 02:55.510
You could just as easily type in NPM doc or build.

02:55.530 --> 02:57.150
But we don't really need that.

02:57.150 --> 03:00.730
Now it is not important to us at all.

03:00.750 --> 03:07.120
I'm just saying that these are the scripts which you can start with the node package manager or MP M

03:08.690 --> 03:16.200
So you can open up the CMG as before as you can see I've already done some testing here.

03:16.230 --> 03:22.450
Go ahead and clear the screen with the command C-L as going CD.

03:22.990 --> 03:25.990
May just go ahead and do this sequence.

03:26.090 --> 03:33.100
So we need to navigate over to the QuickStart and mine is on the desktop.

03:33.410 --> 03:38.780
So I'm just going to go ahead and navigate over to the desktop and type in QuickStart pastor and enter

03:39.380 --> 03:46.090
and from here I will be able to invoke NPM.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.500
You can see that older files are in fact there.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.240
I sincerely hope that you two have actually downloaded this to a desktop or it doesn't matter if you

03:54.240 --> 03:59.370
didn't you could have downloaded wherever you wanted it to be but as long as you can navigate in the

03:59.370 --> 04:04.710
C M D to that folder to the QuickStart master folder anyway.

04:06.410 --> 04:15.050
In order to basically install the dependencies all we need to do is type in n p m install and this will

04:15.110 --> 04:18.830
actually install the dependencies needed.

04:18.920 --> 04:24.300
If I press enter it will just going to take a while but it will happen.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.720
There you go it's happening slowly one by one.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.150
It's going OK.

04:31.190 --> 04:31.840
There we go.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.240
It's done so no big deal.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.410
I mean it is a virtual machine.

04:35.410 --> 04:40.430
It is a little bit slower and I have done this like 100 times prior to this because I had some sound

04:40.430 --> 04:41.510
issues.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.480
So if you or if your output is a bit different.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.150
No big deal as long as you don't get any errors.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.980
So just type in NPM install to install the dependencies.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.860
Also we can see the properties of the scripts.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.310
These are scripts that we call with NPM.

04:58.550 --> 05:02.390
We are basically the start.

05:02.390 --> 05:12.790
You do actually invoke the start with NPM you type in NPM start and this will actually start the script

05:12.970 --> 05:15.400
start to commence embedded in there.

05:15.400 --> 05:21.170
So look let me just show you what I mean by it NPM start press enter.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.080
And there you go.

05:22.090 --> 05:28.380
It says TSC and concurrently and then you have the A C dash W and local server.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.050
And there you go.

05:29.050 --> 05:37.120
It's actually loading but you have the same things written out here as you can see DSC you can currently

05:37.120 --> 05:41.320
TSC the W little server so you can see it all there.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.610
What is going to happen.

05:42.820 --> 05:49.180
So you can look at the properties of the scripts that you are invoking with the MPAA which is a very

05:49.180 --> 05:53.210
useful you can know in advance what is going to happen.

05:54.330 --> 06:04.430
OK so the next for the next file that we're going to play around with is the TS config dot Jason.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.110
OK.

06:05.190 --> 06:08.670
So we can leave all of this as it is no big deal.

06:08.670 --> 06:11.400
Actually let's just not.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.350
I mean we could but I'm just going to press control seats terminated because we don't actually need

06:16.350 --> 06:18.100
it running now.

06:18.270 --> 06:21.290
We will need it running later but no big deal there.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.850
I'll just go back to the ID and look for the TS config.

06:26.850 --> 06:31.680
Jason let me use my expert skills in file finding.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.740
There we go.

06:32.970 --> 06:41.190
Open it up and we will need to actually go ahead and alter this file a little bit in order to make it

06:41.190 --> 06:43.640
suitable for our needs.

06:45.290 --> 06:51.500
So the first thing that we will do is actually create a new folder sorry and that new folder will be

06:51.500 --> 06:57.200
called the M P so t m p.

06:57.260 --> 06:57.800
There we go.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.750
So this is our new folder TMB.

06:59.750 --> 07:05.300
And as you can see it is completely empty as I'm clicking on the air and nothing is popping it down

07:05.420 --> 07:07.190
below.

07:07.570 --> 07:13.880
So under compiler options here we need to go down to the bottom place a coma here.

07:13.900 --> 07:22.540
Press enter and then open up the quote marks and add the following line.

07:22.810 --> 07:30.580
So out dear go outside of the quotation marks colon.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.190
And here we're going to type here.

07:33.220 --> 07:42.380
We're just going to go ahead and open up the quotation marks and type in the m p slash app so when d

07:42.500 --> 07:53.030
ts C typescript compiler compiles it will compile into t slash app folder so that the compiled files

07:53.090 --> 07:55.220
wouldn't actually bother us elsewhere.

07:55.250 --> 07:58.370
It will be very useful anyway.

07:58.400 --> 08:03.870
The next thing that we need to do is go to System dot config dot.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.110
J.S..

08:05.210 --> 08:09.630
So let me just go ahead and find it should be.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.740
There we go.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.280
That was like hit and miss.

08:14.870 --> 08:19.230
And here we are going to make some alterations as well so.

08:19.280 --> 08:26.190
Under var map here will need to just make some make very few changes.

08:26.270 --> 08:31.370
So where it says here and where it says we have Cloudmark app..

08:31.370 --> 08:35.550
Quote Mark colon and then we're just going to have a single quote mark.

08:35.550 --> 08:39.800
Again type in MP slash app

08:41.890 --> 08:43.210
and

08:45.480 --> 08:51.630
so when this begins looking for files from the app folder it needs to

08:58.160 --> 09:00.350
I seem to have made an error here.

09:00.390 --> 09:01.910
Such a wonderful error.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.550
C'mon I need to delete all of this.

09:10.050 --> 09:19.590
And OK so under var map all you need to do is type in the empy slash app.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.890
But pretty much it.

09:22.350 --> 09:31.320
You're basically stating when when it is looking for files from the app folder that it should look instead.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.260
In DMP slash app that's quite literally it.

09:36.270 --> 09:40.860
So now we're just going to go ahead and press control as the save.

09:40.980 --> 09:53.040
And then we're going to go ahead and just save and control this save for all three files and then show

09:53.970 --> 09:55.070
just take a look one more time.

09:55.110 --> 09:56.470
It DMP is empty.

09:56.490 --> 10:05.640
So now we shall go ahead and type in and p m s thart and press enter.

10:05.810 --> 10:06.650
Wait for it.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.380
Gates running the script.

10:09.390 --> 10:14.150
Excellent you can see that the MP is being populated.

10:14.330 --> 10:18.070
It's loading it's loading it's loading up on.

10:18.080 --> 10:25.370
OK my first dangler to app and where it says appere you can see that the components have been placed

10:25.370 --> 10:25.700
here.

10:25.730 --> 10:32.750
Amongst other things and the DMP folder has indeed been populated without any problems.

10:32.750 --> 10:40.580
OK so in the fall of tutorial we will continue explaining some of these other files before we actually

10:40.640 --> 10:42.580
start coding.

10:42.650 --> 10:46.590
I will bid you farewell here and I'll see you shortly in the follow up tutorial.
