WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.210
OK we'll come back will.

00:02.250 --> 00:08.000
So now if we have all three files downloaded here just go ahead and minimize Firefox.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.660
That's all you need to do there.

00:09.990 --> 00:18.240
Now open up your file manager in windows go into Downloads folder and in the Downloads folder find file

00:18.240 --> 00:19.880
called Adam set.

00:19.890 --> 00:22.300
It will have a green icon.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.420
Just go ahead and double click on it to start it.

00:25.530 --> 00:30.010
Click on run and wait for it.

00:30.010 --> 00:36.350
Adam is not the fastest one out there I can tell you that much in terms of development environments.

00:36.670 --> 00:40.840
I think even the eclipse starts faster but it's not really a big deal.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.840
Once you it's really well adjusted for our needs it's free.

00:46.330 --> 00:52.570
And if if the installation takes a while just let it run just let it go.

00:52.930 --> 00:55.780
Go make a cup of coffee or something.

00:55.810 --> 00:56.760
It should be fine.

00:56.770 --> 01:03.790
This is the virtual machine so it's a little bit slower but it's running on a PCI based SSD and that

01:03.790 --> 01:06.280
should help me out a little bit.

01:06.280 --> 01:12.450
If you're running it on HDD it might be a little bit slower for you but no worries there whatsoever.

01:12.460 --> 01:20.060
Just let it run as you can see it will finish there and then it needs to auto start after it finishes.

01:20.050 --> 01:26.740
Just wait a while for it to auto start the first steps are a little bit painstakingly.

01:26.800 --> 01:32.560
Well not a little bit there actually painstakingly slow but no big deal there.

01:32.620 --> 01:37.340
Don't go about clicking around thinking that there is something wrong.

01:37.390 --> 01:37.990
There isn't.

01:38.020 --> 01:41.230
It's just it's just the start up procedure.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.990
So you need you need to wait for it a little bit.

01:44.170 --> 01:51.340
We will need to actually install node just as well and then we will need to load the project into the

01:51.460 --> 02:00.820
Adam ID and after that we also need to actually do a few things in the QuickStart master as well as

02:00.820 --> 02:05.050
he can see that spinning the blue thing is spinning next to my mouse so something is still happening

02:05.050 --> 02:05.950
in the back.

02:05.950 --> 02:10.870
Don't go about opening things while this is happening just wait for it to start for the first time.

02:10.960 --> 02:16.990
It's still loading putting some things together even though you don't actually see much of it happening

02:17.200 --> 02:19.310
on the screen itself.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.480
It could have actually made the video shorter.

02:22.530 --> 02:26.800
We could have just double clicked on the installation went through the installation and then cut out

02:26.890 --> 02:27.890
this bit.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.670
This long wait.

02:29.680 --> 02:36.010
But I wanted to leave it in primarily due to the fact that in all likelihood you will face the same

02:36.010 --> 02:38.270
thing when you conduct your installation.

02:38.290 --> 02:46.450
And I don't want you to think that something went wrong because it really didn't and I'm just waiting

02:46.450 --> 02:47.170
for it to start.

02:47.170 --> 02:47.860
There we go.

02:48.160 --> 02:55.210
So it did take a while but after a while it did load and start later on it will be faster while you

02:55.300 --> 02:56.590
actually work in it.

02:56.590 --> 03:01.520
But for the time being the first startup is painstakingly slow.

03:01.690 --> 03:07.330
OK now that this is done we can go ahead and install KNode.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.010
J.S..

03:08.020 --> 03:12.830
So there will be a file called node and then there will be a version number next to it.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.660
Just go ahead and double click on it and click on run again.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.790
It should be faster so just go ahead and click on.

03:17.790 --> 03:23.250
Next accept the license agreement and sign your life away in all likelihood.

03:23.680 --> 03:31.580
Then click on next and next again next install Yes.

03:31.810 --> 03:36.150
This process should be fairly fast you shouldn't encounter any difficulties here.

03:38.470 --> 03:40.270
Should finish relatively it should.

03:40.270 --> 03:46.140
It should even finish faster for you and go ahead and click on finish.

03:46.170 --> 03:46.620
Excellent.

03:46.630 --> 03:54.090
Now the data is noted that is done we need to go back to Adam and click on open project.

03:54.130 --> 03:59.270
Now if you've done this before and something went wrong and you're doing it again you might have some

03:59.270 --> 04:05.200
metadata remaining and you might get the same screen as me so you can also click on file and

04:08.710 --> 04:15.820
then you will have ADD project folder so you can also click on that and then look for the project here.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.730
But we're not going to do that now.

04:17.860 --> 04:22.990
We're going to go ahead and click on open project and then we're going to click on Open Project here

04:23.080 --> 04:24.240
again.

04:24.610 --> 04:32.120
This might be a little bit slow but I don't know it was slow for me once but if it's slow for you the

04:32.120 --> 04:33.040
first time around.

04:33.050 --> 04:34.670
Just relax don't go clicking around.

04:34.670 --> 04:39.610
Don't click on Open Project 100 times just click on it once and wait for it to finish.

04:40.010 --> 04:43.490
So you need to go again on the monitor again.

04:43.490 --> 04:49.070
You need to go to desktops or this PC and then desktop where we have downloaded QuickStart select the

04:49.070 --> 04:49.830
folder.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.500
Open it up and that's it.

04:51.510 --> 05:00.770
So it will say this PC desktop QuickStart master click on select folder and you will get and this will

05:00.800 --> 05:06.650
load for you all these files so if I click on them they will they will open up on the right side where

05:06.650 --> 05:09.050
you will have all these things here.

05:09.260 --> 05:11.230
So no big deal there.

05:11.240 --> 05:18.180
The next thing it will do is open up ACMD So go to this search bar here and type in C. m d.

05:18.290 --> 05:23.090
Press enter and the default location wants to see him the is open.

05:23.090 --> 05:31.130
In most scenarios is basically your user your user folders so it will say see users and then your user

05:31.220 --> 05:31.630
name.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.670
My username on this particular machine is test.

05:34.730 --> 05:41.450
I have created it like that because I'm only going to use this machine in order to create this course.

05:41.450 --> 05:56.990
So go ahead and type in CD space desktop backslash QuickStart press enter and then type in and p m space

05:58.270 --> 05:59.020
install.

05:59.030 --> 06:01.440
That's all you need to type in and then press enter.

06:02.390 --> 06:05.820
Wait for it now NPM install my.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.440
Might take a while but also it might.

06:08.510 --> 06:15.680
You might get an error unrecognized command if you have actually started this up prior to actually installing.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.020
No genius you need to install no JS and then open C and D.

06:20.270 --> 06:25.400
Otherwise it won't actually work the way you expected it to work and you need to be in the QuickStart

06:25.400 --> 06:29.080
Dasch master folder in order to run this command.

06:29.120 --> 06:38.300
So this is running and it is going to run as long as it needs to in order to actually obtain everything

06:38.390 --> 06:41.640
that it needs.

06:41.650 --> 06:44.910
So there are some failures with dependencies but it's going to.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.530
These are warnings not errors.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.770
As long as it's a warning it's going to go through.

06:48.910 --> 06:52.480
Everything else can be fixed later as we go along.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.000
Our mayor as we proceed along our merry way

06:57.740 --> 07:06.530
again don't freak out if this takes a while if this spinning thing here is making you dizzy feel free

07:06.530 --> 07:10.880
to just minimize the terminal or something.

07:10.910 --> 07:17.390
Whatever doesn't really matter it's just going to take a while for it to finish.

07:18.780 --> 07:23.180
So it's just up there you go.

07:23.220 --> 07:29.320
Just space or something and it's going to continue on spinning on and I'm a little bit disoriented when

07:29.320 --> 07:35.280
they see d in Windows generally used to dealing with a Linux terminal which is far superior to this

07:36.460 --> 07:37.980
but no big deal.

07:37.990 --> 07:45.220
The commands in terms of and PM are exec are pretty much the same so you won't have any problems there

07:45.880 --> 07:48.090
for as long as you don't get any errors.

07:48.090 --> 07:49.870
Your you are good to go.

07:49.900 --> 07:50.770
It's a warning.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.810
Once again it's fine.

07:52.810 --> 07:54.450
This can be fixed later.

07:54.460 --> 08:00.460
As you can see the some package has been depreciated and discontinued in favor of another.

08:00.460 --> 08:05.960
This is not a big deal for us at this point in time.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.120
Ah the spinning the spinning backslash.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.740
Will it ever finish.

08:11.740 --> 08:13.430
Hopefully it will.

08:13.730 --> 08:19.220
Oh yeah make sure while you're doing this that you are connected to the net.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.210
So just verify that you are.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.070
You can either ping something or do something similar like that.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.370
No big deal.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.730
I know that I'm connected I can see it here.

08:30.690 --> 08:33.940
I says connected but I always check with a ping but doesn't really matter.

08:33.940 --> 08:39.300
I'm pretty sure that you will be connected to the net while you are doing this anyway.

08:39.380 --> 08:44.210
Because obviously I'll be watching it online so you'll be able to see it.

08:44.240 --> 08:44.900
Excellent.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.780
This is all done.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.430
It's all fine and dandy.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.020
We didn't get any errors.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.900
None that I can see anyway.

08:52.100 --> 09:00.070
The next command you need to type in is and the and space start.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.390
So this is going to start and there we go.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.680
Almost happening.

09:08.070 --> 09:09.570
OK allow access.

09:09.570 --> 09:11.550
It's important that you click on allow access.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.890
Otherwise it won't work and there you go.

09:14.900 --> 09:25.910
It's a localhost Colan 3000 local host is the address and then Colan 3000 is the port and it says my

09:25.910 --> 09:28.070
first angular to app.

09:28.220 --> 09:31.520
So the development web server is running.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.760
All is fine and dandy there.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.230
No big deal.

09:35.240 --> 09:39.590
Now we need to go back to Adam and we need to go to.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.400
We need to we need a we need something for.

09:42.650 --> 09:47.600
Well this is not a strict requirement but it would be very nice to have it.

09:47.600 --> 09:55.310
We're going to go ahead and click on packages and we're going to go to settings view and then down below.

09:55.320 --> 10:00.440
We're going to go ahead and click on manage packages a finer mistaken

10:03.490 --> 10:07.500
it like a justice and we just go up there we go.

10:07.500 --> 10:14.080
Let me just move this and then from package's move downwards go to install and then search for a package

10:14.150 --> 10:22.130
package that you need to search for is Adam Dasch type type script.

10:22.130 --> 10:24.170
My apologies for my phone.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.870
It's just Adam typescript.

10:25.900 --> 10:31.790
And go ahead and click on packages and it says searching for packages.

10:31.790 --> 10:37.820
The very first one that comes along it says Adam typescript the only typescript plugin you will ever

10:37.910 --> 10:38.860
need.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.760
I don't believe a word of that.

10:40.790 --> 10:41.460
OK.

10:41.630 --> 10:47.420
Just go ahead and click on install and the installation should go through eventually.

10:47.570 --> 10:50.360
Yesterday I think that the server was down.

10:50.360 --> 10:58.790
We were unable to perform the installation but hopefully today the installation should go through just

10:58.790 --> 10:59.170
fine.

10:59.180 --> 11:05.820
Again one of those painstakingly long procedures just let it run if it doesn't.

11:05.840 --> 11:11.580
If it doesn't happen to you at the time of the installation just add an old truck.

11:11.590 --> 11:12.510
Try it.

11:12.530 --> 11:16.130
Try it a little bit later or something like that.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.610
Why I really can't help you with this.

11:18.670 --> 11:23.590
It's up to the server on the other end that's all that there is to it.

11:23.630 --> 11:29.750
It's not really up to me it's up to the good graces of the service provider

11:32.840 --> 11:36.930
installation procedure is it.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.130
No I've clicked on it.

11:39.340 --> 11:42.350
Install come on my good man today please.

11:45.220 --> 11:49.980
I'm just going to let it hang there for a while and then I'm going to come back to you.

11:49.990 --> 11:52.050
I will tell you for how long to die.

11:52.090 --> 11:53.060
Let it hang.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.860
Ok sorry for the delay.

11:54.880 --> 12:01.120
I was just checking my task manager whether I actually had any network traffic of whatsoever.

12:01.120 --> 12:09.070
I have waited for 7 minutes for this to install now the installation is not long but there was a limit

12:09.070 --> 12:15.220
in terms of traffic and I imagine that at the time when I was doing this during the night a lot of people

12:15.220 --> 12:20.310
were pulling at the same time so I'm just going to go ahead and close the task manager.

12:20.350 --> 12:24.450
But it's installed now just in case.

12:24.550 --> 12:26.470
This is running a bit long for you.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.090
That's nothing unusual.

12:28.090 --> 12:34.450
A lot of people are pulling it you can while this is happening while it says Install and that bar is

12:34.450 --> 12:34.890
spinning.

12:34.890 --> 12:43.170
You can go ahead and type in Task Manager and open it up though.

12:43.410 --> 12:44.840
Yes I did.

12:45.150 --> 12:49.650
So it's your task manager if you're opening it up for the first time it's going to look like this.

12:49.650 --> 12:55.580
Just go ahead and click on more details then go to performance and then go to Ethernet.

12:55.620 --> 13:01.440
And here you will see network traffic happening so if there is a lot of network traffic obviously it's

13:01.440 --> 13:05.580
attempting to download it if you don't have any other websites open or anything like that.

13:05.670 --> 13:07.970
If there isn't then might be a problem.

13:07.980 --> 13:13.630
But as I said I waited for the whole 7 minutes to get in line to be able to download it.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.250
So don't worry about it.

13:15.360 --> 13:20.210
Just click on install and have a cup of coffee or something like that.

13:20.220 --> 13:21.320
Now that is done.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.180
Our environment is set up to the fullest extent.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.490
We have the development server.

13:26.520 --> 13:34.770
We have our I.D. the Quick's angular QuickStart is loaded up and no JS is installed.

13:34.770 --> 13:38.080
Everything is set up configured and as it should be.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.260
From this point on.

13:39.300 --> 13:45.270
Along our merry way we will most likely do some cosmetic things.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.440
I will.

13:46.780 --> 13:49.980
You will tune it to your liking and I will tune it to mine.

13:49.980 --> 13:52.050
I will set the font size for myself.

13:52.050 --> 13:54.500
You will set the font sizes for you.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.810
I will show you of course how to do this.

13:56.880 --> 14:04.140
We will have an introduction video where I will explain the features of Adam I id and where is what

14:04.290 --> 14:06.370
an orientation of a sort if you will.

14:06.390 --> 14:13.440
But what you need to know now is that our environment is fully set up and good to go as it is everything

14:13.440 --> 14:15.200
it will do with environment.

14:15.240 --> 14:20.640
In the fall of the story or something like that will mostly be cosmetic changes and also of course along

14:20.640 --> 14:29.370
the way as we code and create our project we might do some other changes and I will show them in great

14:29.370 --> 14:31.730
detail to you so you won't miss out on anything.

14:31.730 --> 14:39.180
I won't do anything without actually showing it to you and showing it how you can do it your selves.

14:39.430 --> 14:47.010
OK so I'm going to go ahead and bid you farewell here and hopefully we shall see each other in the follow

14:47.010 --> 14:48.080
up tutorial.
