00:00.450 --> 00:07.670
Ok so today we're going to talk a little bit about N-G class directive and we'll see what it does.

00:07.740 --> 00:12.830
So let's have the code already written out here you'll be able to.

00:12.870 --> 00:13.510
I will.

00:13.590 --> 00:14.810
I will go through it.

00:15.090 --> 00:18.570
But let's just go to the site and see what's going on here.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.870
See I was doing some testing.

00:21.300 --> 00:28.920
So I've added a button select and when I click on that button select the background changes color to

00:28.960 --> 00:32.510
does horrifically I see.

00:32.820 --> 00:35.790
Well it's painful for green.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.720
That's painful for the eyes.

00:37.740 --> 00:38.850
Let's put it like that.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.280
If I click the select it is the color changes to a pleasant Gray.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.480
Select the select see what is happening.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.410
So how do we go about implementing this logic.

00:51.750 --> 00:56.650
Well the very first thing you need to do is go into the sea.

00:56.850 --> 01:03.300
SS Well that's not the first thing that you can do but I'm just explaining it in that order.

01:03.330 --> 01:11.860
You'll put dot selected and you will put the background color to this horrific Gray.

01:11.870 --> 01:19.020
Now we're going to go ahead and enter the app component.

01:19.090 --> 01:19.450
Yes.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.360
And here there are a few things that we need to do.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.470
So let's begin from the top.

01:27.580 --> 01:31.630
The first thing that we're going to need to do is basically just see where it is.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.530
OK.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.770
So create this array.

01:34.790 --> 01:43.560
This is basically a private property of type array whose elements will be of type Boolean.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.980
And we have already initialized two of them.

01:46.990 --> 01:53.200
We have stated we have populated two of them so this falls falls and we would like the initial status

01:53.290 --> 01:59.270
of our first two accounts to be non selected non selected.

01:59.670 --> 02:07.300
You can see the the constructor has been removed and I have simply added this to initialize to do two

02:07.300 --> 02:11.040
initializations in the same way without the constructor.

02:12.450 --> 02:19.310
Anyway so disarray it immediately sets the initial status for both of them for both counts to be false

02:19.320 --> 02:19.740
false.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.980
So they are not selected.

02:23.430 --> 02:31.320
And down below we have a function we have a method which basically determines whether something has

02:31.320 --> 02:41.440
been selected or not so it says this dot underlines selected and index some index which is basically

02:41.440 --> 02:42.340
passed to the function.

02:42.340 --> 02:50.690
So we're determining which ID we would which element of which ID we would like to be selected or de-selected.

02:50.950 --> 02:56.650
And then we're just negating the status of the element of disarray.

02:56.650 --> 03:02.380
So it says selected and then it says 0 1 2 3 4 5.

03:02.380 --> 03:10.780
So go to Element 5 take the value of Element 5 so the start cycle will take the element of value 5 and

03:10.780 --> 03:14.320
let's say that that value is false.

03:14.320 --> 03:23.720
It will equal to false being negated because this and this will produce the same value.

03:23.740 --> 03:27.310
But since we have an exclamation mark this will be negated.

03:27.310 --> 03:30.910
This year will be negated so false will become true and true will become false.

03:30.910 --> 03:35.780
We're basically just reversing whether a certain element of the array is false or true.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.030
If it was false it will become true if it was true.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.540
It will become false.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.580
Simple as that.

03:42.090 --> 03:50.730
Now during the creation of the new account we would also like to add the status of the new account which

03:50.730 --> 03:56.670
will be false so this underlined selected Bush as you can see this is no different from adding a new

03:56.670 --> 04:05.250
account except we are populating the other array as well which records the status of what is something

04:05.380 --> 04:11.220
of weather for that particular account is the selected option.

04:11.220 --> 04:19.410
False or true and we of course have the deletion here set as well so when we remove the account we would

04:19.410 --> 04:25.960
also like to remove it state it's selected status with the selected status is false or true.

04:25.950 --> 04:33.690
I would also like to delete that so you can basically say that this boolean array here is matching the

04:33.780 --> 04:42.000
account's array so one and two one is matching the other in terms of how many elements it has and its

04:42.000 --> 04:44.340
positions.

04:44.380 --> 04:50.640
So for each account for each element of the account for each element of the.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.160
How did I name it.

04:54.650 --> 05:04.860
Selected array so I creative accounts or is the accounts where have I placed it.

05:05.210 --> 05:05.940
OK.

05:06.330 --> 05:16.730
So for each element of the array of the array accounts please have a status recorded in a different

05:16.730 --> 05:22.220
array which is basically selected underline selected that is its name.

05:22.230 --> 05:34.130
So each one of those in fact let me just go ahead and do this control X and place it for my comments.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.240
OK.

05:38.090 --> 05:39.320
Let's just place it here.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.480
So you see each one of these elements.

05:42.830 --> 05:48.920
This could have been done probably a different way you could have placed you could have placed an additional

05:48.950 --> 05:50.850
field here but doesn't really matter.

05:51.200 --> 05:56.330
So anyway you have I wanted to highlighted.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.050
OK.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.310
Well you can put a semi colon.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.760
There we go and put a semi-colon.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.240
Then the highlighting will work.

06:05.710 --> 06:13.620
Anyway as I was saying each element of the selected array will match elements of the account's array.

06:13.710 --> 06:19.170
So each element of the account's array will have its status designated as false or true.

06:19.230 --> 06:27.290
The initial status for this account and this account is basically false and false.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.060
And this will be the default.

06:29.080 --> 06:35.340
I've left a comment here a small one and this will be the default state of each new created account

06:35.460 --> 06:39.080
as as you can see when an account is created.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.960
A false or true value is added to our selected array.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.100
So we're immediately adding false.

06:46.110 --> 06:50.640
In this case we're not going to be adding true because we want the initial status of all new accounts

06:50.640 --> 06:57.410
to be unselected only in the case that the user selects it will it become true.

06:57.420 --> 07:03.780
Now let's go to the HD and all and there is just one thing that has been treating the entirety of the

07:03.790 --> 07:12.730
HD M-L and that is the engg class directive which has been added and in addition to that we also created

07:12.730 --> 07:14.620
a select or de-select button.

07:14.620 --> 07:22.560
So let's go over those two so you have in your class directive which is equal to something here something

07:22.560 --> 07:23.680
strange.

07:23.760 --> 07:31.910
Basically the syntax is the same as with property bindings so we will need the curly braces.

07:32.580 --> 07:36.310
And this is what you see this what you see here.

07:36.330 --> 07:40.890
This is an object.

07:40.890 --> 07:50.200
This here selected this is the property and to write this underline selected is the value of the property.

07:50.670 --> 07:58.050
So you have selected and then you have underlined selected and the element of the array is specified

07:58.050 --> 08:03.810
that element of the array is specified through the index which we have used in the end G-4

08:07.140 --> 08:10.260
this will in effect.

08:10.410 --> 08:17.340
Basically if the value pooled from the array is true the source code for this will look something like

08:17.340 --> 08:17.780
this.

08:17.780 --> 08:25.320
So A.S.C. underline selected if the value of underlined selected if the value pool from this array is

08:25.320 --> 08:30.670
false the code will look like this.

08:30.680 --> 08:37.220
So that's what the NGI class does here basically determines whether this is true or not and whether

08:37.290 --> 08:41.150
this will be included in the class or not.

08:41.150 --> 08:49.710
We will see that in the source code of site when we get a little bit and see the output down below.

08:49.710 --> 08:56.280
We have a button and so on click we would like to call a method select and pass an index and pass and

08:56.490 --> 08:58.970
pass the best index to it.

08:59.130 --> 09:00.460
Then you have nothing.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.780
Nothing really new here but you have a bit of a logic here.

09:03.780 --> 09:10.020
So this is basically a simpler way or a shorter way of writing an if statement.

09:10.260 --> 09:15.190
So this will pool of value from the selected array and if that value depending on what the the value

09:15.190 --> 09:16.440
is false or true.

09:16.590 --> 09:22.140
So if it's true you will have de-select that will be the name of the button.

09:22.140 --> 09:28.390
If it's false you will have select in the name of the button.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.740
So let's go ahead and see how this actually works.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.150
I press select.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.030
This happens when I press the select.

09:36.110 --> 09:36.880
This happens.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.650
OK let's press F 12

09:41.500 --> 09:45.400
and Q So I just find it.

09:45.430 --> 09:46.120
My app

09:51.380 --> 09:54.490
OK just clicked on a couple of times.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.170
OK.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.300
So you see here since it's not like that it says div class equals a c c.

10:03.410 --> 10:03.760
OK.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.250
So nothing strange there.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.230
Nothing new.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.500
That's fine.

10:07.680 --> 10:18.730
But if I click on select you see it says A.S.C. selected and since it says your selected we have our

10:18.820 --> 10:20.710
good old fashioned CSSA.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.880
It says Dotts selected and this is the background for it.

10:25.060 --> 10:30.190
So if the SS sees this starts selected that is

10:32.740 --> 10:39.280
implemented here A.S.C. underline selected it will of course change the background color to this particular

10:39.310 --> 10:40.770
color here.

10:42.070 --> 10:45.840
I know it's a little bit I know it's a lot to take in just like this.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.860
Believe me it is very simple.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.800
If you have any questions feel free to pose them.

10:49.800 --> 10:56.580
We will gladly answer them without any problems whatsoever and we will gladly offer further explanation

10:56.640 --> 10:58.980
and insight as needed.

10:59.610 --> 11:05.210
But for the time being I bid you farewell and we shall continue onwards.
