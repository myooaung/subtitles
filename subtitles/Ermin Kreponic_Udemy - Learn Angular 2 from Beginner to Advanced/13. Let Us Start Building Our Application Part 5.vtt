OK so let's let's have a look and see how this actually works.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.440
What's minima what's ahead write this.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.050
So the code is still here.

00:14.050 --> 00:20.160
Make sure that it is saved so that so so that it would be loaded.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.760
And let's go back to the site.

00:25.090 --> 00:32.500
So it says this is my main bank account and the balance is such and such but and I don't know there

00:32.500 --> 00:33.450
is some other work.

00:33.460 --> 00:39.950
There was another one which we have also initialized it says bank A.S.C. a the bank Ex-White cert and

00:40.050 --> 00:40.620
this.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.220
So this is the title.

00:42.220 --> 00:49.880
This is in this iteration or IT index and the description this is the balance.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.080
And the same goes for the next account.

00:52.090 --> 00:57.250
So if I click on delete it will disappear and if I click on delete again it will disappear.

00:57.250 --> 01:00.720
And both of them will disappear and I will say you do not have any accounts yet.

01:00.730 --> 01:02.930
Please add it or add.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.910
Damn I should have written that but it doesn't matter.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.430
However this is not being saved to a database or anything like that.

01:08.620 --> 01:15.930
So that might be a little problematic for us because as you can see if I refresh the site press control

01:15.930 --> 01:24.870
our UPS renationalisation will occur and I will have the beginning status basically from where we began

01:24.890 --> 01:27.090
their reshow and up.

01:27.630 --> 01:34.140
That's why later on we will implement a database so that we can have permanent changes on our site that

01:34.170 --> 01:38.330
we can actually store things from our site store the information from our site.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.970
And of course this will start looking a lot prettier.

01:40.980 --> 01:47.120
I mean there is there is a version of the bootstrap that is running now with angular too.

01:47.140 --> 01:51.860
But I will show you how you can actually customize things on your own.

01:52.010 --> 01:59.040
Anyway let's go ahead and create a title here so bang.

02:00.610 --> 02:06.660
The description I am broke.

02:08.410 --> 02:09.360
Amount of money.

02:09.410 --> 02:15.390
Well a lot of Neyens create and there you go.

02:15.390 --> 02:16.650
It indeed created.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.430
But if I refresh the site

02:21.250 --> 02:22.170
it disappears.

02:22.210 --> 02:26.970
So that's the current logic of the current state of things and how it actually works.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.700
Because we're not saving anything anywhere.

02:29.740 --> 02:33.090
The initial code is just being reloaded anyway.

02:33.400 --> 02:39.400
That's how it works going to be for a while here and in the follow up chapter we will move on to styles

02:39.760 --> 02:46.750
so we don't necessarily make our site pretty but I will show you how you can actually change things

02:46.840 --> 02:51.610
how you can change the the way things look and display on your site.

02:51.610 --> 02:58.060
Don't worry eventually as we move onwards with our application this will start to take shape.

02:58.740 --> 03:06.140
And it will look better and better and better until it actually starts looking like a real world application.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.110
So farewell.
