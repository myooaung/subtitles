00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.070
It's fine for this project is going to be pretty straightforward.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.160
We're just going to create a background color and then add

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.085
some colors to our buttons along with some responsive layout.

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.075
Since the styling is pretty straightforward,

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:19.530
I'm going to just start this over the top of our index page.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.930
Just inside of the head section,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.555
we can create the style section,

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:30.115
and if you want to keep this separate and places into a separate style sheet.

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:37.350
The html is going to be used to set the base font size of 10 pixels.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.815
The body section, all we're going to do here is to set a background color,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:46.525
and then we're going to create our responsive layout.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.005
We're going to use the flexbox.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.905
Then on the smaller screens,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:55.340
we'll set our sidebar and our main section to be the display type of column.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.420
Then we'll change this on the larger screens to be the type of row.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.530
First of all, the background-color,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.635
which I'm going to be using as a rgb value.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:12.635
The red color is going to be 48 and 47 for the green value,

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.290
and the same for the blue.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.750
The display type is going to be

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.460
the flexbox and we can change the flex direction to be column.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.500
We don't see much of a difference at the minute bulb.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.740
We're go to separate these two sections by making

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.210
the main section three times as wide as the sidebar.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.550
Let's make this a little wider.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.675
Can again take advantage of the flexbox and

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:51.440
set the main section to have a flex value of three.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.205
To make this work, we also need to set the side section.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:58.590
This is going to have a flex value of one.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.465
For reload, we don't see any effect on the page.

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:06.220
This is occurring because we have the flex direction set to column.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.430
To make this work more on the larger screens,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.455
we need to add a media query to change the flex direction to be back to row.

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:17.130
Let's add @media.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.140
Where we can set our minimum width to be a value of our choice.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.160
I'm going to go for a value which is going to be 1,000 pixels.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.180
The only thing we need to do inside here is to target our body section,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.000
and then change the flex direction to be row or to the browser.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.660
Now if make this a little larger,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.420
we see the flex value of three.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.050
For our main section,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.675
only sidebar has a flex value of one,

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:50.125
meaning it's one-third of the size.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:54.420
Reducing this down to 1,000 pixels or below will

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.810
return our flex directions to be back to column for our smaller screen.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.070
For the sidebar on the larger view,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.380
we're also going to add just a little margin on

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.490
the left-hand side to give us some space from our image.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.100
The sides section, we can set the margin on the left of 0.5rems.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.540
Then we're going to get to work with these buttons.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.120
The buttons are for all of our effects and also the clear and the download buttons.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:36.405
The background is going to be an rgb value of 21, 20 and 20.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:39.235
Let's make these a little larger with some Padding.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.825
So 1.6rems on the top,

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:46.760
zero on the right will keep this consistent with the top and at

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.040
1.6rems on the bottom and then add 2rems on the left-hand side,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.835
which is going to give us some spacing from the left of bottom.

00:03:55.835 --> 00:04:01.040
The font size of 1.6rems,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.715
which is 16 pixels.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:07.185
The cursor is going to be set to be a pointer,

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:10.525
when the user hovers over any of these buttons.

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:13.620
The color so we can see the text.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.080
This is going to be an rgb value.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.435
The red is 212,

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:20.850
210 for the green,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.595
and the blue value of 210.

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:26.150
Given our text a lighter colors,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.785
so it stands out more.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:34.995
We can also remove this default border by setting this to a value of none.

00:04:34.995 --> 00:04:37.220
Then we can use our own border on

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.035
the very bottom to give us a white line between each one of these buttons.

00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:46.580
This white line is going to be one pixel wide and a solid color.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.245
Next we're going to add a hover effect to our buttons.

00:04:50.245 --> 00:04:53.225
We do this with the hover state.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:57.610
All we need to do here is to give his background color a slight change.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.610
The value I'm going to go for is a rgb value of 50,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.130
47 and 47. Let's give this a try.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.105
That's all good. Now we're going to put all these buttons onto their own lines.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:19.595
This is relatively straightforward all we need to do is to target our effects class,

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:24.495
which is the div wrapper for all of these buttons down in our HTML.

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.875
Let's target our effects.

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:31.625
We need to set the display type to be flex.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:33.380
Then to make these vertical,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.260
we can set the flex direction to be column.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.310
Down to our controls, which is the Clear and the Download button.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.210
We are going to make sure each one of these buttons takes up

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.125
half the width of the available space.

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:54.155
Again, we're going to make use of the display type of flex,

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:57.230
and then we can target each one of our buttons,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.170
which are nested inside of this control section.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.530
If we set the flex to be a value of one,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.300
this is going to make sure that each one of our buttons inside of

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.530
the section is going to take open equal amounts of space.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.540
We still have a board on the very bottom so we can remove this with border-bottom none.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.075
If we scroll up, the next thing we're going to do is to move all of the texts,

00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:29.430
these buttons to be over on the left.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.930
We can do this by setting the text align to be left.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.320
Then for our two buttons on the bottom,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.370
we can reinstate this by setting this to be a text-align and to be center.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.385
We can also remove the padding values for this Clear and Download button. The padding.

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:55.105
Let's go for 1.6rems on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right,

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:59.115
which will then pull our text into the center of our buttons.

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:04.555
Back up to the top we have this section which has a label and also a input.

00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:07.470
Let's begin with our label.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.685
Set the font size to be a little larger.

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:12.920
So 1.8rems.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.175
If we also stretch the browser to be a wider size.

00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:19.190
When these two elements are alongside each other.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.680
We also need some padding on the right of this label.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.190
I want to add 1.6rems.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:33.545
Both this label and also the input was surrounded in a div called input wrapper.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:38.970
Now we're going to use this and add some padding and also a background color.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.740
This was the class, so we use the dot.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.710
The background wants to give this a simple color of

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:53.890
gray and also a padding value of 1.6rems.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.980
Then to finish this CSS section off,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.605
we're going to select our canvas section,

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.365
which is over on the left-hand side in the main section,

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:08.160
and then set this to be 100 percent of the available space.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.625
That's all we're going to do. We can go ahead and make some more changes.

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:20.105
What someone's keep the style of this project reasonably simple,

00:08:20.105 --> 00:08:21.500
and then in the next video,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.570
I'll move on to drawing to the Canvas.
