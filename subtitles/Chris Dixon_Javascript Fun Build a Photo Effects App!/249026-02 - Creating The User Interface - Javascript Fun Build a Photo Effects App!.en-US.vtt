00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome to our next project,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.685
which is the photo effects application.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.405
The user interface is going to be relatively straightforward,

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:12.690
especially in comparison to some of the other projects.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.055
All we're going to do is to create a sidebar over on the right-hand side.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.980
This is going to have a series of buttons which are going to create

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.775
an effect on a photo which is being uploaded.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.345
We can go ahead and select the file,

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:32.860
choose an image, and then this will display this inside the browser.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.180
Then have a series of effects.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.565
We can make this a grayscale effect.

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:39.785
We can clear these effects.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:44.065
We have invert, we have the sepia effect,

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:46.630
and then we have a series of buttons,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.235
which is going to switch around our red,

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.990
green, and blue values.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.130
This is going to give us some different effects such as this.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.745
This is going to give us a more red shade.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:03.850
An effect that this has is going to be pretty different on each image.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.415
To do this, we're going to swap around all the pixels

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:10.730
on the image to give us these nice looking effects.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.970
We also have the facility to download this image.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.350
We can click on this button.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.370
This will then download the image for us to use.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.700
As with any of the projects on this course,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.460
you can use an image of your choice.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.085
Or if you want to use the same image that I've used for this project,

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.635
head over to the GitHub repository,

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.130
and then you can go into the Photo Effects application,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.340
where you will see not only the sample code once this is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.660
uploaded but also the image which I'm using during this course.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.765
To get started, I'm going to download this.

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:51.540
Click on the image name, click on "Download".

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.960
We can then right-click, "Save" our image.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.805
I'm going to save this on the desktop.

00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:02.340
We also need a project folder.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.965
Let's head back to our desktop,

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:11.770
New Folder, which is going to be the photo effects.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.000
Drag this over into

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.550
our Visual Studio Code and then let's make sure

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.355
our image is available inside of our project folder.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:27.360
Let's drag this over and drop this into our project folder.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.430
Step one is going to be to create a new file,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.290
which is for our index page.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.155
This is going to be the index.html.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:39.060
We can then open this up in the browser,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.750
copy the path to this,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.070
paste this in, and we are good to go.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.825
Let's begin with our HTML structure.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:55.445
As ever, I'm going to use the html:5 command,

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:58.525
which is built into Visual Studio Code.

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.720
The document title is the Photo Effects App.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.280
Then inside the body, we are going to surround all of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.400
the photo area inside of the main element.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.610
We'll then have the aside section,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.110
which is going to be our sidebar.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.560
This is for all of our buttons and the image upload.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.765
The main section is going to be pretty straightforward.

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:30.700
This is simply the area which is going to display our image inside the browser.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.050
The way we're going to do this is by creating a canvas element.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.495
A canvas is a HTML element which we'll be using to draw our images to.

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:44.800
It can be used to draw almost any type of graphics from lines and shapes,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.660
photos, ripe fruits, complex, 3D objects,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.149
although in this course we will only access the 2D features,

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.970
more specifically the 2D context and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.445
we'll take a look at this in more detail in the JavaScript.

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:05.775
We need to create a canvas element and then an ID which is going to be canvas too.

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.545
This is just so we can select this element in our JavaScript,

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.070
and then we can draw our images.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.240
Next up the aside section,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.440
which is going to contain our uploader and our buttons.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.480
The first section is going to be a div with the class of input-wrapper.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.980
This is going to be the section which is going to have

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.460
our label and also the file uploader.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.020
The label for this input will have an ID of uploader and then the text of select file.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.950
After this, a input,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.340
and the input type for this is going to be file with the ID of uploader.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.640
We can then use this inside of our JavaScript and this also matches our label just above.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.200
Next, after our input wrapper,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.260
we can create a second div.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.155
This div is going to have the class of effects.

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:12.350
This is going to be the area where we select all of the effects using these buttons.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.620
The first button, this is going to trigger the grayscale effect.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.950
The second button, this is for the sepia effect.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.150
The third one is going to be for invert.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.490
The fourth one, this is going to be the start of the four buttons,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.740
which we are going to switch around our red,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.680
green, and blue values.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.930
The first one is going to convert the red, green,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.950
and blue to be red, blue, and green.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.850
Let's duplicate this to create four buttons.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.575
We're always going to start with the RGB color.

00:06:01.575 --> 00:06:04.220
The left-hand side will always be the same.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.410
However, for the second button,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.840
this is going to be switched to be blue, green, and red.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.750
The next one is going to be green, blue then red.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.720
The fourth combination we're going to use is green,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.520
red, and then blue.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.640
If this color combination I'm switching around

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.920
doesn't make sense at the moment, that's fine.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.040
This will all become more clear when we take a look at pixels in the JavaScript section.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.270
After our effects section,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.505
we're going to create a new div.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:37.940
This div is going to have the class of

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.550
controls and this is going to have our clear and also our download buttons.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:53.445
The first one of clear and the second one is so our user can download this image.

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:57.705
Give this a save or we could even open this up with our live server

00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:02.015
if you've chose to use this during this project. Let's open this up.

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:04.625
Go to View and the Command Palette,

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.020
where we can take a look for

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.610
our live server and we can open this up with our live server extension.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.530
Now inside the browser, we have a pretty terrible looking application,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.540
but all of the content is in place.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.180
Let's style it in the next video.
