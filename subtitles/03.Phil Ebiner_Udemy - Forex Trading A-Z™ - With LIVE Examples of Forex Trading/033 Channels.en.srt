1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,450
This talk about channels for a minute.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:10,320
Huber got an upward trend and as we discussed previously we can draw a support line which represents

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,370
a diagonal which is kind of guiding the price and the price keeps bouncing off it in its journey to

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,520
the top.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,860
Now what are we going to do.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,240
We're going to take this diagonal and we're going to copy it and we're going to put it above the price

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,430
.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,970
So there it is.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,230
It's got the same angle as the first one and it's sitting on one of the highs of the process.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,880
So once again as you can see here the price is also bouncing off this diagonal as well and bouncing

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,760
downwards.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,230
The price is kind of moving in a channel or Korder.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,380
Now what are we anticipating from the price of four.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,720
Well right now we are probably expecting for the price to bounce off the top border and then to go back

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,240
up.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,920
This is where we would enter into by order or so once the price has bounced off we would wait for it

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,960
to hit the bottom of the channel and to buy order.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,510
And if the price goes in our direction once it hits the top border again thats when we would close our

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,060
trade.

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:26,220
So its important don't hear that in an upward channel you it is recommended to trade only by orders

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,530
.

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,550
And why is that.

23
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,800
Well let's step back take a few steps back for a second.

24
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,590
At this stage we are anticipating for the price to go down.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,610
So we could technically conduct the sell or.

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,370
But its not advisable for two reasons.

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,810
First of all we'd be trading against the trend and that's something we said we shouldn't do.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,320
We should always trade with the trend and second as you can see here the downward movement is actually

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,260
smaller than the upward movement.

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:00,840
So in an upward channel if you create sell orders you will always earn less than if you create by orders

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,110
.

32
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,530
So that's another reason why in an upward channel you should only trade by.

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,620
Next we're going to look at a downward channel.

34
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,340
So here we've got a downward trend.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,200
We can draw a resistance line if we copy that line.

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,660
We can see that very often the price will also follow the copied line so it won't break through it will

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,320
bounce off that line and channels of very common on the 4 X market and you'll see that from our live

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,360
trading on the real account.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,190
Further down in this force.

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,980
So here we're expecting the price to go pop there will conduct to sell order and we'll close our order

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,250
.

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,810
Once the price reaches the opposite side of the channel.

43
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,990
So once again in a downward channel it is advised to open sell orders because you'd be in this case

44
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,720
you'll be trading with the trend and you get longer movements.

45
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,210
And so those are the two main ways of trading channels.

46
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,930
It's actually a one way but in two different types of channels and it's always trading inside the channel

47
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,100
and more often than not the price does stay in the channel.

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,110
But sooner or later of course the price will break the channel and that's why there's an alternative

49
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:21,690
strategy where and this case is sort of opening a sell or you would open and buy order and you would

50
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,930
expect the price to go up somewhere out of the channel you would use this strategy.

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,650
When your other analysis is telling you that this channel is getting too old and the price is going

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,930
to break through it.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,580
So when a channel is quite new There's more chances that the price will stay inside when the channels

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,990
have been around for a while.

55
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,150
The chances of the prize breaking out are constantly growing.

56
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,680
Both strategies are valid.

57
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,660
Depends on the situation and what your other technical analysis tells you.

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:01,560
So to sum up of channels direction trade with the channel stay inside the channel it's more likely that

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,040
the price will bounce into the channel as an alternative strategy which is a breakthrough strategy and

60
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,260
that is used when you expect the price to break free from the channel
