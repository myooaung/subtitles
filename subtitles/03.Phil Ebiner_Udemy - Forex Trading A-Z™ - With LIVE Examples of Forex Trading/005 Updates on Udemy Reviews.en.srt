00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,550
Hey guys.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,970
Welcome back to the caucus training course.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,300
It's early morning.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:16,830
These ghosts are still sleeping and I'm in Africa and I wanted to take you for a quick walk here just

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,090
to show around.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,450
Show you what it's what it's like to live in Africa and in the meantime while we're on this quick walk

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,660
I also wanted to give you a quick heads up.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,510
Very soon Tim is going to ask you to leave a review for this course.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,720
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,050
This early on however the unit review system has simply changed and they are asking to leave a review

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,570
earlier and earlier on in the course.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,860
Now if they're minded we're not going to ask you to leave a five star review for this course.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,030
But what I would like to ask is that if you're not yet familiar enough with the course to radio five

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,220
star of course then please scroll through the tutorials and have a look at all the different things

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,370
that we cover and all the exciting topics that you will learn inside this class and hopefully once you

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,040
see that it will give you the confidence to write this course a five star course if on the other hand

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,990
you feel that something is wrong with the course.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,500
If you're unsatisfied about something if you feel that something's missing then please do let us know

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,470
before you write the course.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,200
The best way to contact us is if you leave a short message in the course Q and A.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,100
And we will get back to you or we'll fix up whatever the issue is and then get back to you.

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,230
Check out this this guy over here they love sleeping on walls on they.

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,870
So yeah I will get back to you and hopefully that will give you the confidence to write this course

24
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,320
the five star course.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,610
Now having said that if if something's wrong please do let us know.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,210
But if you feel satisfied of the chorus if you're enjoying the tutorial so far if you're excited about

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:55,020
the journey ahead and you feel that this is a five star course then please do read it appropriately

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,490
so that the rest of the world can also know that this is a five star course on forex trading.

29
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,710
So there we go.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,930
Thanks a lot guys for being part of the forex trading course or courses if you're taking several of

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,510
us.

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,710
Really appreciate you being inside this lesson.

33
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,870
I'm very excited for the journey ahead.

34
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,970
And before we go I want to share one more cool thing.

35
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,190
So this box over here.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:25,470
This is actually a TV and this is where people sit to watch the TV when there's a soccer match.

37
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,660
That's that's how to want you do.

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,070
All right see you guys have fun in the course.
