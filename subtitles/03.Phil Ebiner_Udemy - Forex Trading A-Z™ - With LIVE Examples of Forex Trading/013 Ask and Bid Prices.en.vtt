00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:08.580
All right so ask unbid prices when you go on a holiday overseas you usually want to exchange your home

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.900
currency for the domestic currency of the country you're traveling to.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.820
And in order to do that you would go to a 4 x exchange booth and these booths will always have two different

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.530
prices.

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.880
We sell price and we buy price and depending on the transaction you're trying to make.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.700
You'll be quoted at one of the two prices.

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.380
So if you're exchanging your home currency for the domestic currency of the country traveling to.

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.170
You'll be quoted at one of these two prices.

9
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.440
And when you come back and you have all this excess currency of that other country and you want to exchange

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.570
it back into your home currency you will be quoted at the other price.

11
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.890
Same principle applies in the Forex market.

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.010
Any Forex currency actually has two prices.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.360
Ask price and the bid price the ask price will always be above the bid price and the ask price is the

14
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.660
price that you would be quoted at.

15
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.500
If you want to buy the base currency if you want to sell the best currency you will be using the bid

16
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.290
price.

17
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.660
So here we are using the British pound Australian dollar as an example and in that currency the British

18
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.110
pound is the base currency the Australian dollar is the core currency.

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.020
So if you want to buy British pounds then you will be using the ask price.

20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:38.030
And this means that for every one British pound you would have to pay 1.8 873 Australian dollars.

21
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.020
Now if you want to sell British pounds then you will be using the price.

22
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.510
And for every one British pound you would get one point eight eight six six Australian dollars.

23
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.360
So as you can see you're always paying more to buy than you're getting when you're selling.

24
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.600
And that's the principal Forex market.
