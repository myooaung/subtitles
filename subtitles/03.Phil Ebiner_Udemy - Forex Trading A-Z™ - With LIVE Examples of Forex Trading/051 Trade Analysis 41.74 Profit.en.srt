00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello and welcome back and right away congratulations.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,530
It has been 11 days since we opened our order according to the harmonic parents analysis.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,340
And yesterday the order closed at a profit.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,420
So you can see the profit over here it's the last or all in the history of $41 and seventy four cents

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,720
.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,470
So we're just going to drag it onto the charts so we can see how it played out.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,030
And here you can see we opened the order here so we we didn't know any of this part.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,660
We always saw with these three dollar bars and that's where we made our decision to sell.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,430
And we opened the order just for comparison.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:48,180
I have I'm going to bring up a snapshot of the screen when we made our order.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,750
So you can see it here on the left.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,320
And as you can see we didn't know any of that movement.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,660
It was a purely technical analysis decision.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,800
We saw the harmonic pattern we saw the Gartley butterfly and we decided to enter.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,800
And now as you can see 11 days later we have been rewarded with a take profit.

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,490
So that's beautiful just an amazing result.

17
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,100
Let's quickly have a look at how the market played out.

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,890
So we're going to zoom out a bit here you can see a bit better what happened.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,410
So we had or maybe even a bit more so we had this downward trend and we had a bit of a consolidation

20
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,490
when we got to the.

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,380
This is the zero point eighty level.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,350
Here it is.

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,810
So this is a zero point eight to level the market was very unconfident getting to this level.

24
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,520
And you can see how the power price bounced off a couple times.

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,970
And by doing so it formed this harmonic pattern which we actually use for our analysis.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,990
Then the price went down at this stage kind of tested the zero.

27
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,740
You got to the zero point a 0 6 level kind of.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,220
There was a bit of pressure for the price to move up.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,730
Words went up a bit.

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,550
It was a good thing or a really good thing and we said I'll take profit up top here protecting it with

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,490
the zero point eighty three level that's exactly what the price that are here.

32
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,300
So the price tried to cross as a report a three level but it didn't.

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,700
Then a bit of consolidation again and then it just started tumbling down and that's where our take profit

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,790
was reached.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
Beautiful result.

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,790
It very well said take profits in the sense that it's really sort of sort of stop lost in the sense

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,510
that it's very well protected.

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,840
A good take profit as well and let's have a look and see where the price actually went up to.

39
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,310
I think you might be a little bit surprised actually.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,040
So we're going to drag out take the Fibonacci levels and we're going to drag them onto our last movement

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,080
of the Gartley pattern and we'll see where they will end up.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,740
So we've dragged them like that.

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
Now is going to move them here.

44
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:24,000
And what do you know the price actually just touched the 161 point eight level.

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,740
Isn't that fascinating.

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,280
That's exactly what we talked about in the previous tutorial we said that the Gartley apparently gives

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,310
you targets where to set your take profit and something I mentioned was the can I said at one sixty

48
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,220
one point eight or one twenty seven point two but we're going to set it somewhere in between because

49
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,310
we don't want to cross the Zero Point 79 level we do what we don't want to worry about it because the

50
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,250
0.18 level is strong enough.

51
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,340
In practice what actually happened the price touched the one sixty one point eight level and and and

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,050
bounced off.

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,670
And it's a it's a resistance line here.

54
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:13,050
Isn't that just fascinating that we had a harmonic retracement here sixty one point eight percent but

55
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,620
a Fibonacci ratio.

56
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,760
Then we had a harmonic tradesmen here hundred twenty seven point two percent that's the square root

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,180
of the ratio.

58
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,080
And now we have a harmonic movement.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,210
One hundred sixty one point eight percent.

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,780
Just something to think about how mysterious and yet very effective these Fibonacci levels and harmonic

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,870
retracement patterns actually are in in practice.

62
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,100
So that's it for today.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,820
Congratulations on that great trade.

64
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:56,410
Also it was a good example good good illustration of the usage and effectiveness of harmonic parents

65
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:56,840
.

66
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,630
If you're interested to find more about them I encourage you to read.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,650
Read on and find additional information because they can be quite useful in your trading.

68
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,550
I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

69
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,430
And until then happy trading
