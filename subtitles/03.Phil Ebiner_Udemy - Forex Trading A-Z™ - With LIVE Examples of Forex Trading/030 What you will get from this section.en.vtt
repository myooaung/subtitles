Hello this is Kirill for Expo dot com.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.150
And welcome back to the course on forex trading in this section we will be talking about technical analysis

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.060
and in particular I will provide you with your technical analysis Arsenal a comprehensive base of technical

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.680
analysis skills and tools that will help you cover most of the trading situations.

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.880
You will find yourself in before we proceed.

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.030
I'd like to underline that whatever we talk about in this section are my views and all of this is derived

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.150
from my personal experience of trading the other tutorials and courses that you might find on the Internet

8
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.360
.

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.950
They might have different views and a different way or idea of skills and techniques to use in the Forex

10
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.300
market.

11
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.220
And that's totally fine.

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.350
You're more than welcome to in your free time to explore additional skills.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.540
However what I provide is in my view the most important things that will help you.

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.120
In most cases and to start off with I would like to quote the Pareto Principle which states that 80

15
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.200
percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.940
And this can be applied to things like 80 percent of these are usually contained in 20 percent of the

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.080
pods in a garden 80 percent of sales of a lot of companies come from 20 percent of the clients 80 percent

18
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.840
of work can be done in 20 percent of the time.

19
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.650
That's a principle and it applies in lots and lots of situations in life.

20
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.790
And I personally believe it also applies in technical analysis and it's not a coincidence that I call

21
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.980
this section technical analysis Arsenal because there is a limited number of skills and techniques that

22
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.290
you need to know to cover most of the situations you'll come across.

23
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.630
And I believe that the techniques that I'm going to cover in the section are about maybe 20 percent

24
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:05.640
of the techniques that you can find out there as a starting or traitor and they will cover 80 percent

25
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.280
of the situations that will come across and you'll see that in our live trading we will be we will limit

26
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.120
ourselves to these to any set of techniques and we'll be able to trade in most of the cases.

27
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.800
And so a lot of courses and a lot of books get technical analysis make it seem very complicated and

28
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.680
confusing.

29
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.430
And I want to avoid that in this course.

30
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.450
We will look at a limited number of the most efficient most powerful techniques and that way they will

31
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.300
seem simple and they are simple and they will cover most of your trading.

32
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.760
Let's sum up in three bullet points what we're going to cover in the section will cover techniques and

33
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.490
skills that will get you through 80 percent of situations on the market.

34
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.990
And that doesn't mean that you won't know what to do.

35
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.610
In other cases it just means that you won't have to trade in other cases and you'll find the right situations

36
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.080
for the skills and techniques doesn't.

37
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.040
Not at all doesn't mean that you will have any difficulties or trouble that just means that you will

38
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.300
trade when you find these techniques to be working on the market.

39
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.680
We will make everything very simple broken down into extremely intuitive steps.

40
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.350
That's the way it should be some technical analysis is simple in nature and everything should be clear

41
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.740
everything will be clear in this section because it is important to understand the principles and how

42
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.550
they apply.

43
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.170
They can be any gray areas that technical analysis has to allow you to create a strict trading strategy

44
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.830
which will tell you whether to enter the market or not change the market.

45
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.300
So those are the three things I will be aiming for and that's what you will get from this section
