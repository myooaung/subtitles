1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:08,040
Fundamental analysis this type of market analysis is based on that belief or de-emphasis that somewhere

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,620
out there in the world there's information or knowledge that is not yet reflected in the market price

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:13,900
.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,130
And traders who use fundamental analysis believe that they can take advantage of that by entering into

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,050
the right position whether it's a buy or sell.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,230
Fundamental analysis involves things like reading and understanding news about certain currencies understanding

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,890
the global economic climate and what trends are happening there and what was going on in the world.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,100
That is actually affecting these currencies.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,840
Understanding what's happening with resources because a lot of currencies actually correlate with resources

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,450
or are heavily dependent on the supply and demand for certain resources.

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,820
One of the very convenient ways of doing all of this is through a economic calendar a calendar of economic

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,710
events.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,370
It kind of sums up all these things that are happening in the world for you of course you have to do

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,780
your own research but it's a good starting point.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,320
And that's exactly what we'll be looking at in the fundamental analysis section.

16
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,940
I'll show you how to properly read a faux economic calendar or issue a really good one.

17
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,220
How to derive insights from it and how to actually trade currencies based on the calendar of economic

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,650
events.

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:34,260
Also one more thing that you should keep in mind is that fundamental traders get very attached and very

20
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:41,580
intimate with the currency pairs that trade so fundamental trader wouldn't be diverse across all the

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,170
currency that you have in your terminal.

22
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,850
But Hughes pick one two or three like for example the British pound all the British pound Australian

23
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,160
dollar maybe the euro a British pound he would because he would know a lot about the British pound.

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,010
He could trade Krause's of the British pound and also each one of them would be very unique because

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,240
only certain events are affected only certain types of resource affected.

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,390
And being a fundamental trader you have to develop this and you will develop this kind of intimacy with

27
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,120
the currency pairs you trade to become very good at them and so on one hand you become like a expert

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,910
at those kind of spares that you trade.

29
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,960
But on the other hand a lot of the knowledge and skill that you develop in within those currency pairs

30
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,040
are not applicable on other currency pairs.

31
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,210
And that's kind of the two sided coin of fundamental analysis.
