00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello this is Kirill from Forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,800
And welcome back to the course in forex trading today is going to be a very exciting tutorial because

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,940
we're going to be talking about people notchy numbers and they involve a lot of mystery and we're going

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,630
to have a lot of fun and I can't wait to jump straight into it.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,730
However before we do proceed I'd like to ask you to leave a review for this course.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,460
I know I've already asked previously and if you have left to review then thank you very much.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,250
But if you haven't lived through a few hours I really appreciate if you could spend less than a minute

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,040
of your time to just quickly review and rate the scores.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,060
It can be done very simply you just have to on the course page click this button up here write a review

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,340
.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,990
Then you just select the number of stars you think the course deserves and type interview if you want

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,230
to if you don't you're just like the number of stars click at a review and that's it.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,560
It really helped me out and it would also assist other students in understanding whether this course

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,640
is worth their while before taking it.

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,180
So I hope you can do that.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,960
And now let's proceed back to the course so Fibonacci levels.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,090
So who is this person Fibonacci.

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,150
Well the real name of Fibonacci is actually Leonardo of Pisa. Fibonacci is kind of a nickname which

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:24,000
he got and most likely it meant a good son was born he lived in the 13th century and he's most famous

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
for his Fibonacci sequence.

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,830
So what is the supernature sequence.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,380
Well let's imagine a sequence of numbers which starts with the number one.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,250
The second number is also one and then going forward.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,650
Every next number is equal to the sum of the previous two.

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,080
So the next number in this case would be a two.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,660
The next number after that would be three because one plus to three the next number two plus three is

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
five.

28
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,680
The next number after that is an 8.

29
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,290
Let you guess what the next number would be.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,490
That's right the next number is 13.

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,000
And so on just keeps going forever.

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,700
So what's so great about this supernature sequence that makes it famous.

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,990
I'll show you right now.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,720
Let's quickly plot the number one in number two on a horizontal axis.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,740
Now what we're going to do is we're going to go through the sequence and take every number of the sequence

36
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,790
and divided by the previous number in the sequence and plot our answer on the same axes.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,810
So one divide by one is equal to 1.

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,720
We've plotted with an orange cross.

39
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,410
Now let's divide to buy one and we get two. Three divided by two is one and a half five to over three

40
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,180
is 1.6 x 6.

41
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,050
They divide by 5 is 1.6 thirteen divided by eight is one point sixty five.

42
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,280
21 divided by 13 is one point six on five.

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,740
So you kind of see where this is going.

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:47,340
The Crosses are getting closer and closer to one specific certain number and that number is 1.6 1 8

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,870
0 3 3 9 and so on.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,810
And this number is known as the golden ratio which is usually represented by the Greek letter fee fee

47
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,760
is equal to approximately 1.6 when it.

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,360
All right so by now you're saying Carol you're boring me for this math.

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,510
What's what's the purpose.

50
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,440
What's the point.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
Well let's have a look at some of the examples of where you can find the golden ratio that will probably

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,570
blow your mind.

53
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,900
First of all if you measure the distance between the edge of your fingertips and your wrist and then

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,920
you measure the distance between your wrist and your elbow it will be approximately 1.6 when it go ahead

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:25,970
.

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,070
Pause the video and give it a go.

57
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,230
You'll be surprised at how accurate this is.

58
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:41,400
Next your fingers actually your phalanges on your fingers actually are in the same ratio as the Fibonacci

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,940
numbers.

60
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,830
So 2 3 5 8.

61
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,500
If you don't believe this picture then here's an actual X-ray.

62
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,600
Also if you take any starfish and you measure its base and take as a one then the distance between these

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,960
two limbs will be 1.6 point 1 8.

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,820
Now if you want to get even more depth then we'll take the Fibonacci spiral and you can read about it

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,900
separately but it's basically constructed of the Bonacci numbers and you can find the people not just

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,940
spiral in many many places in the world for example a lot of our shelves are full of the same pattern

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,540
as Banaszak spiral.

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,810
Some galaxies not all of them but some spiral galaxies also fall the golden spiral pattern.

69
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,460
So it kind of makes you wonder how come the Fibonacci ratio can be seen in so many parts of nature.

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:43,290
Let's take one more example let's take the human DNA and if we measure its width and its length then

71
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:52,280
they will be exactly 21 Armstrong and 34 and so we're as strong as a unit of measurement for very little

72
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:52,850
things.

73
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:02,670
And if you recall 21 and 34 or are actually in our Fibonacci Sequence a coincidence maybe but that's

74
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,350
quite a lot of coincidences.

75
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:13,110
And moreover what's not a coincidence is that there have been experiments that have proven that figures

76
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,830
and patterns following the Fibonacci ratio are much more appealing to the human eye than those which

77
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,440
do not.

78
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,130
So there definitely is some sort of mystery on the Fibonacci numbers.

79
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,510
Nobody knows exactly why they're so common in nature and in the world.

80
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,430
But what we can do is maybe take advantage of it including in trading.

81
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:44,790
So what traders and analysts did well they said if you've been watching numbers are in our DNA and if

82
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,470
they're more appealing to the human eye and if they're all over nature let's have a look and see if

83
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,050
we can actually find them on for X charts.

84
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,170
So let's see what they found.

85
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:02,110
If this is a just a random 4 x chart then very often you'll find that if you measure the distance in

86
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,840
your Trents So the main parts of the upper part and then take it as one unit and then you measure the

87
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,370
distance that the price traveled during the retracement phase.

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,480
You will often notice that the retracement is equal to 0.6 1 h.

89
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:24,760
It's not the best part is that if you divide 1 by the golden ratio you will get 0.6 1 8.

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,510
So this basically means that if you take your original trend as 1.6 1 8 then your retracement will be

91
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,260
one.

92
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:38,670
So basically you see the golden ratio here will just return back to 0.6 1:08 which is the inverted coloration

93
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:38,900
.

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,110
So how can you use this in your trading.

95
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,140
Well let's assume that we don't know any of that.

96
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,840
We know that has been a trend and we can see a retracement is starting Well now knowing about the gold

97
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,620
ratio we can predict that with a good chance the retrenchment is actually going to go just exactly up

98
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,990
to that 0.6 1 8 level.

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,910
And that means we can enter into sell order some over there and we can enter into or buy order once

100
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,770
the retracement has completed.

101
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,330
Knowing that there a high chance that from here on the trend will continue.

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,290
So that's all theory but let's have a look at a live example.

103
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,260
This is the euro dollar for our the chart which I took a snapshot of yesterday.

104
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,830
As you can see here we've got a downward trend.

105
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,380
First of all and then we've got a bit of a retracement.

106
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,650
So how about we go ahead and measure them.

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,960
So the downward trend started up here then the price went down went down a bit slower went down fast

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,080
went down a bit when actually up again went down and that was the end of the trend for now.

109
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,570
Then the price started moving back up went down a bit and then went back up.

110
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,040
So we're going to measure the distance between those three points and those lines indicate where our

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,530
measurements will be.

112
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,640
So if we take the first the original trend we take it as one unit then you will notice and you can take

113
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,250
a ruler and measure this on your screen if you like or even open up the same chart and perform those

114
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,730
measurements.

115
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:19,350
You'll notice that retracement was exactly 0.6 1 8 and I didn't have to look for this example.

116
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:26,330
This was the first chart I opened up Eurodollar for all the time frame January 2015.

117
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,810
You can scroll through any charts you like.

118
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,470
And sooner or later actually sooner rather than later you'll find one of these examples.

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,870
So the golden ratio is very powerful not only nature but also in all forms trading.

120
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,300
And we can use it to advantage and you will see examples of this in our life for accelerating further

121
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,880
down in this course.

122
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,430
By the way if you're using military metaphor there's a very handy way to measure these retracement in

123
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,810
search for beracha retracement.

124
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,200
You'll get a very handy tool which allows you to effortlessly measure Fibonacci retracement.

125
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,130
On that note we'll finish up today's tutorial please do liever review if you haven't yet.

126
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,250
I'll really appreciate it and I'll look for it next time.

127
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,660
Until then happy trading
