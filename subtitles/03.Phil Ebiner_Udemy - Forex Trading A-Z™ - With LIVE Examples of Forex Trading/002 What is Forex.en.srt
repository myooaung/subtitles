Hello this is Kirill from forex boat dot com.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,060
And welcome to the course on forex trading.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,580
Today's tutorial will answer the question what is Forex and where it came from.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,080
For extensive foreign exchange it is also sometimes abbreviated as simply FX investor period defines

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,630
foreign exchange as the exchange of one currency for another or the conversion of one currency into

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,760
another currency.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,960
So simply put.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,440
Foreign exchange is exchange of currencies.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,820
Also a superior continues his definition by saying that foreign exchange also refers to the global market

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,870
where currencies are traded virtually around the clock.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,790
So let's have a look at an example.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,070
Say for instance you're going in a holiday to Europe.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,830
In that case you will take your American dollars and go to the exchange shop and convert them into euros

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,250
.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,620
By doing this you've conducted a currency exchange and therefore you have become a participant of the

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,930
Forex market.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,880
We will talk about the participants of forex more in one of the future tutorials.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,940
But today let's have a look at the history of how this used to be back in the day because it wasn't

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,610
always as easy.

20
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,700
So here's a timeline.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,160
And a long long time ago there was no money and no currencies and people had to just exchange goods

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,720
and this was called Barter.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,300
When some people would fish and other people would grow grains and crops they would exchange some of

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,210
their goods in order to have the best of both worlds.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,970
Next around 2600 B.C. Egyptians discovered gold.

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,320
We're not really sure who discovered gold and when but it's attributed to Gyptian around that time.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,520
People liked gold very much because it was very dense.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,790
And it felt very heavy in your hands and it felt more valuable than other things around.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,730
It was shiny and it was soft so you could molded into different shapes and most importantly was very

30
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,300
scarce.

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,810
It was very hard to find.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,000
And that also increased its value.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:05,310
Next around 1500 B.C. gold was used or countries started using gold for international trade.

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,310
So instead of just exchanging goods they would exchange gold for goods and goods for gold and that kind

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,930
of simplified things.

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,260
Then to simplify things even further around 700 B.C. The first gold coins were created and there was

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,830
a very handy thing to how because before that people had to check that the gold that they're receiving

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,750
is actually gold.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,150
And also they had to weigh it up.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,170
But by having gold coins they could already know what value those gold coins are carrying and that speeded

41
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,790
up the process of exchange.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,810
So that's a bit of ancient history which now brings us to the modern world in about the 17th century

43
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:42,980
.

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,600
Paper money started spreading across Europe and around the 18th century it became so popular it started

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,120
causing tensions because some people in countries were still using gold and silver coins whereas others

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,730
were actually using paper money and there was no real connection between the two.

47
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:07,850
And that is when the gold standard came into play the gold standard was agreed upon or in 1875.

48
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,270
And basically what it meant was that currencies became backed by gold reserve of their countries.

49
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,960
In essence that means governments guaranteed conversion of currency into a specific amount of gold and

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
vice versa.

51
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,720
Let's look an example for for instance country A says that it's one 1 unit of its currency equals two

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,470
ounces of gold.

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,630
And country B says that one unit of its currency equals to four ounces of gold.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,110
And that basically means that you now know how to convert currency of country into currency of country

55
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,960
B that made things more simple and also defined certain rules around how these transactions occurred

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,470
and it became the gold standard became the first standardized means of exchange in history so that there

57
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,970
was a good idea in general but then what happened was world where one struck.

58
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,180
And World War Two.

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:10,770
During these wars countries that were fighting with Germany spent a lot of money on their military and

60
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,560
basically they were printing more and more money and which they had to back by gold reserves and the

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,620
gold reserves were rapidly depleting and it got to a point where they couldn't actually guarantee all

62
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,840
that money with gold and therefore the gold standard lost its meaning.

63
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:35,370
And so to fix that issue in 1944 the Allies got together to sign the Bretton Woods Agreement and Bretton

64
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,530
Woods agreement simply put.

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,020
It's just the same as the gold standard Gold Standard Version 2.0 and all it did was it replaced gold

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,660
with the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar became the only currency in the world that had to be backed

67
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:56,130
by gold at a fixed exchange rate of $35 per ounce and all other currencies had a fixed exchange rate

68
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,580
to the U.S. dollar.

69
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,460
So let's have a look at a bit more detail into the outcomes of the burn Woods agreement.

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,770
So first of all fixed exchange rates all currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar.

71
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,950
Second the U.S dollar became the primary reserve currency which meant that it had to be backed by gold

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,110
.

73
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:22,650
And three the creation of two organization the International Monetary Fund which is simply a pool of

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,790
funds where all participating nations contribute to on a regular basis.

75
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,800
And then if they have problems within their country they can take money out of that pool. Fix their

76
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:38,430
problems and then return it plus pay some interest and also the World Bank which is a financial institution

77
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:46,110
of the United Nations meaning that its main purpose is to reduce poverty around the world and help developing

78
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,950
countries.

79
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,650
By the way if you're wondering why it's called the burn was agreement as because it was signed in a

80
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,540
town called Bretton Woods in New Hampshire USA.

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,230
And as you can expect when you create something which is basically the Gold Standard Version 2.0 then

82
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,270
there's a very high likelihood of it failing just as the gold senator did.

83
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,350
And that's exactly what happened to the bread Woods agreement over the years after World War Two.

84
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,970
Gold reserves of the U.S. started depleting very rapidly and in 1971.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,120
U.S. President Richard Nixon closed the gold window by telling all other countries that the U.S. will

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,250
no longer exchange gold for U.S. dollars held in foreign reserves.

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,620
This event marked the end of the barren Woods agreement and since then the world has been using floating

88
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,970
exchange rates between currencies what we now know as the Forex market.

89
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,710
The main two takeaways from this timeline are that first of all it hasn't always been that simple.

90
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,610
It took some time for nations to come up with the current Forex system that we have.

91
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:52,350
And secondly that there have been several attempts at creating fixed exchange rates between currencies

92
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,500
.

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,080
For example the gold standard and the Bretton Woods Agreement and all of these events have failed because

94
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,120
it is very artificial to put such constraints on currencies and try to control them.

95
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,030
It also illustrates that the Forex market that we currently have is by far the most natural thing that

96
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,440
should govern the exchange rates of currencies between each other.

97
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,550
This brings us to the end of today's tutorial.

98
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,690
I hope you enjoyed it.

99
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,450
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

100
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,830
Until then happy trading.
