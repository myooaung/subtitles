00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,550
Types of orders on the forex market there are two main classes of warder's on the forex market and these

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,760
are market orders and pending orders and they're two sub categories in the pending orders.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,530
These are stop orders and limit orders and we'll have a look at all of them right now.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,650
So market orders you're already familiar with these orders these are the byte order and the sell order

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,850
stop orders.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,160
So the first stop of stop order that I'd like to introduce you to is the Bicester.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,260
So basically the bae stop is a pending type of water.

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,250
What that means is that when you set by stop you're not actually entering the market you're setting

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,470
a condition or a trigger or a future order.

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:54,360
So you're saying if something were to happen then I want my terminal to enter the market automatically

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,140
for me.

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,650
So basically what this in this case what's happening is you're saying that if the price reaches this

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:08,070
green line I want to enter the market with a buy order.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
So let's see how that happens.

15
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:17,250
The price crosses the green line and that's exactly when you buy stop order turns into a buy order.

16
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,020
So from that Red Cross onwards your Buy Stop order no longer exists.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,300
Now you have a buy order in the market sell order very similar.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,260
So you're saying when the price crosses the green line I want the market I want to enter the market

19
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,800
with a sell order.

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,030
See when that happens you sell stop orders.

21
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,740
Turns into a sell or instantly.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,340
So what's the benefit of these Buy Stop and sell supporters.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,520
Well it's basically kind of saving you the effort of actually waiting for the price to get to that level

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,270
and then entering the market.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:07,140
So if you're if you think that once the price crosses a certain price a certain price level or support

26
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,780
line you think the price will keep going downwards.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,940
That's when you would want to set a sell stop order and catch that movement as soon as it starts.

28
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,340
Rather than having to sit around and wait for it to happen.

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,030
The other thing is that if that doesn't happen if the price for example in this image that we have in

30
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:34,200
front of us if the price were to keep going upwards then you would never enter the market at a sale

31
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,880
with a sell order because the price wouldn't have crossed your green line and wouldn't have triggered

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,010
the sell order.

33
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,700
So it's kind of a very convenient way to save your time and also check for specific conditions that

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,920
you're looking for.

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:01,440
Limit orders limit orders are similar to stop orders but they may be a little bit more complicated to

36
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,530
remember how they work.

37
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,740
But we'll we'll get the hang of it.

38
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,170
So a buy limit order is actually said below the market.

39
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,360
So what you're anticipating is for the market to go down.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,200
Todd shorter cross'd touch it and then go back up.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,170
So you kind of anticipating a recoil you think that yes the market will go up.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,640
But first it will go down.

43
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,480
And instead of entering right away.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,720
So you could have entered back here with her buy order.

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,840
You want to get the most of this movement.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,460
So you want to actually let the market go down a bit then enter with a buy order and then you'll get

47
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,180
this whole movement rather than getting only half of it.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,350
Once the Red Cross happens over here your buyer limit is no longer by limit or it transforms automatically

49
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,380
into a buy order and you enter the market.

50
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,700
That's the point when you enter the market when the transaction occurs.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,580
The opening of the Order a limit.

52
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,770
It's a very simple concept.

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,540
You are anticipating an upward movement before a downward movement.

54
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,650
So you think that the price will go up.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,950
It will touchiest sell limit order trigger it and then go down.

56
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,250
Once again you would do this if you're anticipating an overall downward trend.

57
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,310
But you think they will first be some sort of retracement upwards and instead of entering the market

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,890
back over here with a sell order you want to get the full movement so you let the market go up first

59
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,320
.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,150
Touch your sell limit order and then go down.

61
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,310
So in this case even if the market price crosses your sell limit order it will still be triggered as

62
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,070
a sell order.

63
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,000
So there's always these risks that the market will trigger you or sell them at or turn into or sell

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,350
order and then keep going upwards.

65
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,370
That can also happen and your settlement order will be triggered and you will be in the market.

66
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:16,740
And that's why you should still use stop loss and take profits with your limits and stop order.

67
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,510
So even if you sell them an order for example you can tell it's to set a stop loss and take profit off

68
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,090
course a stop loss would have to be about take profit would have to be below.

69
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,350
And it works exactly the same way because remember once the orders triggered it will either turn into

70
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,120
a buy order or a sell order and all the same rules apply as before.

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,500
So with your pending orders you can also set stop loss and take profit levels which will be triggered

72
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,340
with the order.

73
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Meaning that since order turns into a buy or sell order that take profit and stop loss levels will be

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:02,530
activated and they will be protecting your order as they would with any other market or.

75
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:11,040
And to sum up how we've got our different order Klaas's different or tops and anticipated market movements

76
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,100
.

77
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,290
So the first two are the market orders they're the buy and the sell we for buy we would enter into a

78
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,780
buy when we anticipate an upward movement and to sell when we anticipate a downward trend.

79
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,370
And then for pending orders we would open a Buy stop or when we think the market will go up and then

80
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,020
it will continue going up.

81
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:39,540
So we kind of want to check this condition that the market will cross some sort of resistance line and

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,420
if that happens then only real ones are by stop order to become a byword sell stop similar.

83
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,410
We expect the market to go down and then keep going down by limit.

84
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,880
We expect the market to go down first a little bit and then go up and sell it.

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,530
We expect the market to go up and then go down.

86
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,730
So that's the summary for order types don't get to lever you for this course if you haven't yet.

87
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,190
I really appreciate that.

88
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,200
And I look forward to your next tutorial Until then happy trading.
