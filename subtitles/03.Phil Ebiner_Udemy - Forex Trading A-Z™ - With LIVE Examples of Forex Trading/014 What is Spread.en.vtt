00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.090
Spread.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.880
So as we discussed ask price is always above the bid price and you will always pay more to buy one unit

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.020
of base currency then you will get when you sell one unit of base currency.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.970
And that difference between the ask and the bid price is called the spread.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.940
So let's calculate the spread for this particular example for the British pound the Australian dollar

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.850
currency pair.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.860
When the prices were as they're illustrated on this chart.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.570
So the spread is the OSC minus the bid that means 1.8 873 minus 1.8 8 6 6 and that means zero point

9
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.640
zero zero 0 7.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.260
So that means less than one Australian cent that is point 0 7 are going straight and said and this is

11
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.980
illustrated in dollars because the currency pair is British pound Australian dollar so Australian dollar

12
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860
is the quoted currency.

13
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.080
Remember our examples of apples so British pound here is like the apple and Australian dollar is the

14
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.840
currency that it's been valued in.

15
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:23.250
So in this instance the spread is point 0 7 of an Australian cent which is very low in our kind of understanding

16
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.120
of the world that when we go to an exchange booth the spread is usually at least a couple of cents maybe

17
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.500
maybe a dollar or so on certain currency pairs.

18
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.000
But on the forex market the spreads very low and this is called very tight spreads.

19
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.910
And that's.

20
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.720
That's right because when you do very large transactions like banks do or when you've got hundreds and

21
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:58.770
thousands of Patris participants participating brokers have they make up some money from the volume

22
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.830
and the quantity of transactions so simply put the brokers actually earn this money or the banks and

23
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.970
brokers that kind of share the spread.

24
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.850
And this is your cost of conducting a transaction on the forex market.

25
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.670
So if you ever want to participate and open a trade you would always pay the spread because you would

26
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.950
buy it ask price for instance and then when you close the order you'd close it at the big price.

27
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.030
So you inherit and we always pay the spread in any transaction and that's a cost of participating in

28
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.410
the market and whether or not you make money that's that's completely up to you.

29
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.410
And that in a in a good broker that has nothing to do with them.

30
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.440
They make money off of spreads and other things like commissions and swaps which we'll talk about later

31
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.580
.
