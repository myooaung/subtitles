00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670
in one of my videos have mentioned that we'll talk about some of the terms like DDO Deimel

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.670
,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.660
Ortiz CEO.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.880
Well,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.800
in fact,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.050
we did talk about all of them in our previous videos.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.530
The only thing is that I didn't tell you that we were talking about them.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.060
My statement would make sense after you listen to this video video stands for data

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.900
definition language and is mentally meant for defining the database,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.110
like the database itself or its relations.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.170
For example,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.240
if I use the create statement to create a database or a relation like create database or

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.300
create table,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.510
then essentially,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm defining the structure of the database.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.550
Similarly,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.950
from trying to make changes to the structure by using the keyword alter.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.310
Maybe I wanted to alter a table to add a new column.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.350
That means I'm altering the structure off the database.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.720
So all these kind of commands,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.410
like create,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.150
alter,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.300
rename,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.870
say,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.150
rename it table or drop it table or a database.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.730
They all fall under data definition language.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.570
They help us define the database altogether,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.800
coming to data manipulation language or D m.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.050
L.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.730
They will help us.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.780
Manu Plate that data in the relations,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.680
for example,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.770
lets her like to insert a data into a table.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.650
What I would want to update existing data in the table or delete some data from the table?

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.370
Are you select to be able to view the data etcetera.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.040
Now this role set of commands,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.260
which have taken as an example off data manipulation language,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.450
which would help us manipulate existing data inside the tables.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.500
But they won't let us actually alter the structure of the database.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.710
I'm not adding here any column or anything of that sort and coming to Decio or data control

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.900
language these will deal with allocating the privileges to the users are roles.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.770
For example,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.550
let's I would like to grant certain privileges to this particular user.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.330
Or maybe I want to revoke certain privileges from another user after I find him misusing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.220
his rights.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.280
So all this sort off commands that we had talked about that deals with the the user

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.080
creation or are a group creation or a procreation?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.150
Then we're actually deferring to data control language,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.630
and finally we have transaction control language,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.880
and we have already taken a look at an example.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.580
I come it roll back.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.510
They all fall under this transaction control language,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.150
so just be aware of that.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.470
And I also want to point out some of the commands that you can run in PS skill now in here

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.470
,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.830
I haven't listed some of the commands that will help us create a table,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.230
create a database alternate table,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.710
etcetera.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.930
They're all they all come under structured query language,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.950
and we have all that it discussed.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.450
But these are set of commands which are popularly used.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.090
For example,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.770
if you say slash l,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.460
that would list all the data basis.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.100
Let me just show you what I mean.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:31.950
Out opened this connect to a database and how do slash l and that lists all the available

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.790
data basis.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.420
Similar.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.050
We got other comment,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.770
For example.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.850
He could use this command slash D to look at the definition off.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.580
Whatever you provide here,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.350
maybe I would like to take a look at the definition off students table.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.470
Then it displays just that,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.980
including its triggers.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.310
If its existing just go through all these,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.950
it's pretty self explanatory.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.730
I'm also going to make this file available for you to don't know so that we can take a look

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.250
at it.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.100
All right.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.250
See you in my next video.
