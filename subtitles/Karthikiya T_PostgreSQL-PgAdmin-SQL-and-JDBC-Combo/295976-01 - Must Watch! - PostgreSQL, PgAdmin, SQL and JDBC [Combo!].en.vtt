00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
full stack developer sort in great demand and are paid very high.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.150
So it's not enough that you'll on one technology but rather full stack off technologies.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.070
We have all the courses on sculpture that would help you become a full staff Java developer

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.530
so that you will gain skills to develop,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.740
end,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.080
to end applications from scratch all by yourself and be eligible for top profile jobs or to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.650
work on freelance projects.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.000
So was it this link?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.220
Its corporate dot com slash skill share.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.650
It has all the links to our courses,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.950
and they're all organized in a proper sequence.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.370
You can start from Java programming,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.170
and here's a link to that course.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.820
Once you complete this course,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.740
you can get into advance Java.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.800
And here's the course link for the same.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.500
Like was,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.250
you keep going and complete the entire stack off technologies.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.350
The courses were also include creating into and applications from scratch.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.180
And if you're struck anywhere,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.900
you can always post your questions.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.060
Even if you're inexperienced.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.550
Dollop er I would highly recommend you to start from scratch because many people who

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.520
followed this approach and gone through all these courses from scratch have seen very good

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.120
results.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.290
Many individuals have clear interviews.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.990
Some of them also cleared certification exams and some of them also got into good jobs with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.200
better income and all.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.270
So I would highly recommend that you followed this approach.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.550
Start from Java programming all the way to all the advanced courses.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.490
Hope it makes sense.
