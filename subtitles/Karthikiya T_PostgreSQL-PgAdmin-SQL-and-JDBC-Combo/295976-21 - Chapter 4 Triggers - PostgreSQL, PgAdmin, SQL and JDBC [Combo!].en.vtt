00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
in this video,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.370
we're going to talk about triggers.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.450
A trigger simply is an automatic call to a function when a certain database,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.880
even Dockers an example often even could be an insert,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.620
for example,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.460
inserting a ruin to a table or delete or update or trunk it.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.330
We haven't talked about trunk it,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.550
but it essentially does the job off what a drop key would would do.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.810
But the differences,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.480
for example,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.150
drop table would delete the entire table.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.960
But if we say truncate table,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.950
it would just delete the rose in it,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.540
not the complete table.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.630
That's the difference.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.960
But this does set off events,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
which you can specify as part off a trigger.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.300
So when one of these events occur,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.540
we wanted to trigger or call a function,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.730
which we right along with that,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.910
we can also specify when that function should be called.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.130
Should it be before a certain even Dockers or after a certain even doctors are instead off

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.410
meaning instead of performing the normal operation what inside dilator a bit would perform

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.410
?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.940
We would instead want to execute the logic in our function.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.290
In that case,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.100
he would specify instead off so in order to create a trigger,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.520
you have to follow the fallings in tax,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.530
you would say create trigger and then you do the trigger name followed by when that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.130
function should be called and on what?

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.630
Even on which table you'd provide.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.620
The table name here and you were also specify.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.460
Should it be,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.050
should they even be associated with the row or a statement?

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.400
If it is with the road,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.260
for example,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.650
every road that is inserted in the table,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.240
you would call a function or if it is statement every time you perform an insert statement

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.240
,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.970
he would call that function.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.550
So you get to choose header off them and finally would say execute procedure.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.150
He would specify the function that you want to execute.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.920
So let's go ahead and take a look at an example and for the sake off this example,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.270
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set a trigger along with the function which that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.950
trigger would be associated with.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.130
And every time a new student detail is an turn,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.170
stood in stable.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.990
I would like to create an entry in another table which will store the student joining debt

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:25.990
.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.910
You'll understand better when we take a look at this example.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.850
So first of all,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.260
let us create that table which will have to feels,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.550
which is to indictee.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.870
And then the date of joining.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.410
Let us run this and he would see that they were getting created.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.390
We have that over here,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.350
so we have it here.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.500
And what comes next is willing to write off function.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.460
And if you observe what it is doing,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.310
it is just simply inserting some data into the table that we have just created.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.460
So these are the two fields which we have in the table student I D.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.360
End Dodge did of joining and whose values are new dot i d.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.280
Basically,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.450
when you call this function using a trigger,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.100
you would actually have access toe the road that is being inserted into students table and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.990
you would be able to access the data that is inserted These in this reference new and then

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.270
you would specify the column name off the students stable.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.760
The current time stream would just simply put the trend date and time,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.890
so this would be the joining date.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.350
The moment a data is entered in student stable.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.080
We're also going to add entering to this table along with the current times tramp,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.770
which essentially means that would be the joining date of that student that has a zoom.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.450
And then you would say,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.470
return new all this keyboards a mandatory.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.950
And in fact,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.350
if you observe the written type of this function is going to be a trigger,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.550
which means we're going to use this function as part of a trigger which is coming next.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.780
So this is how we would go about defining the trigger.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:28.160
But before the letters run this in RPG admin letters and dysfunction is now created.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.290
But if you take a note now,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.970
this function is reciting in a different section that is,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.650
trigger functions smart part off a normal function,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.450
so you would have to call it associating this function with the trigger.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.300
And here is how you would define the trigger.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.790
Basically,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.150
this follows us in tax that we've talked about,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.770
and in my case,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.950
every time there is an insert event on the students table,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.430
and I would like to call my function after that insert even happens.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.030
So I said,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.450
create trigger a good name,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.150
perform a certain action for each row instead of a statement.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.550
Execute procedure and I provide the name of dysfunction hasn't blast that.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.880
So let's run this and we're going to create a trigger all well and good.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.300
Now let's start insert some data into a student stable and see what will happen before that

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.300
.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.650
Let me make sure that there no entries in student joining the table and you see nothing.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:50.580
Now let's try to insert something in here in the students table I'm going to say is,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.350
I'm going to say some name and I'm going to provide some age.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.480
Let's keep 24 and some description.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.970
He is going to be whatever and went public Save Now,

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.950
since we've created a trigger for the inside event,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.150
we should see some data getting populated here.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.760
And sure enough,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.450
we have the student i D,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.510
which is the idea of the student which you have just inserted,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.670
and then the current date,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.550
which would be the date of joining hope that makes sense.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.350
See you in my next video
