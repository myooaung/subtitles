00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
in next few videos,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.250
I'm actually going to walk you through this many project.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.800
I'm calling this application a school management application,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.040
and this is kind of like a enhanced Washington.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.450
For previous example.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.950
In our previous example,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.840
we have seen how toe populate all the student details but in this application were actually

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.150
going to perform all the crowd operations.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.360
So this application would basically list all the students of Elburn the school.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.550
You can add a new student by clicking this button.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.860
Insert that particular the space very well filled.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.570
The digitals off the new student and you click this button once you do so the same will get

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.960
reflected in the stable,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.760
similarly,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.430
can also make changes or make edits to an existing student.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.650
Maybe wanted to change his description or age or his name by clicking this button edit,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.990
and then you will make your updates for that student.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.040
And likewise,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.260
we can also perform delete operation.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.530
Once you click this button,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
he would no longer see that student getting listed in the stable.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520
This is fairly simple application,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.970
and I didn't pay attention to cascading style sheets.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.410
I didn't pay attention to the styling aspect off this application if you wish,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.260
you can do that.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.030
The reason why I didn't do that is because it's going to increase the number of lines of

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.350
court off our GSP page.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.350
Well,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.530
we could actually create a dot CSS violent link it to this page.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.920
But I don't do that.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.650
I see no purpose in doing that,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.630
so that's not pay attention to the presentation aspects.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.290
For now,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050
as it's a very simple job,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.590
we're going to pay a lot of attention to what's happening behind the scenes,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.700
what kindof actions that are being taken place in this application,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.650
etcetera.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.510
And as I mentioned,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.680
this is ah is going to follow the model re control architecture.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.930
So we have the dead access object and now I have introduced a lot off other methods to so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.130
our purpose to perform the crowd operations.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.900
Similarly,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.650
we got a controller the Soviet,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.630
and this time we got quite a bit off a court.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.090
Here,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.040
I'll walk you through each and every bit off it.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.720
We got two pages to JSP view pages.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.430
One is the one which you have seen the home page,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.480
and once you click,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.250
either edit or add you would see this page.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.300
So let me just first talk about dill it as it is,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.650
one of the easiest one in here.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.110
So this is a paid that gets rendered and using this competent for each were looking through

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.460
all the list off students and populating them.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.090
And obviously this list is populated from the Soviet and the Soviet would,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.800
in turn,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.220
will take help from the day Iraq's object to access the data from the database,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.270
retrieve it and present it back to the view.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.280
This is something that we're we've already seen.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.850
But what's new here is this deal it operation.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.620
The beauty about Jsp is that these components,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.070
these custom components,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.650
are actually aware off the country that is populated in it.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.870
What I mean by that is,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.820
for example,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.010
if you click delete here,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.360
then the competent is a wear off this particular record.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.680
So the student object that we're referring here will have information off the student on

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.550
whom were pressing the delete button.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.950
So this to an object will have the current student details.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.020
And then we're trying to access the students.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.450
I d the same.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.760
We're sending it as a para meter were actually calling the soul it with couple off para

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.920
meters when his task,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.500
which is which no cases delete,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.840
will see what's going to happen so that in a second and then the i d,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.730
the current store indictee for whom I clicked,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.350
delete.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.010
So now let's go to the solar it and,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.300
you know,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.690
logic.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.960
We have a switch case,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.630
and if you go to this case delayed,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.430
it's going to actually call this method deal.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.120
It's student forwarding,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.180
both request and response objects.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.020
So let's see what's going to happen there.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.680
So I pressed on control button and click this method that would take us to that mattered

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.410
location.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.680
So all I'm doing here is I'm trying to get the idea of the student that will send as a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.340
perimeter in here and isn't that idea?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.430
Um,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.190
actually trying to delete that student from the database and I'm going to use the post

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.230
Greece dow object to perform that operation.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.840
So I'm calling this method get student of the dark object to get the student details,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.860
so this will actually return this student object.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.990
So if you go to that village student method again,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.270
I press control.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.150
And then I click this method that would take us to that location.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.310
It's going to accept this student object,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.460
and we have a piece off code that will actually delete that user from the database using

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.470
the standard SQL query and what's new.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.070
Here is this prepared statement.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.620
The prepared statement will actually love you to place some placeholders,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.740
which will be a question mark.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.150
And then you can later populate or replace this question mark with something else.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.700
It can be better demonstrated in here.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.630
I'm playing to update a student information here,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.700
and I have a question mark for student name,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.650
age description and the i d.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.090
So I'm able to fill all those placeholders in here in the same sequence.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.780
So when I say set string won a match,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.250
you're referring to the first place holder.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.080
And I said to I'm referring to the second place holder.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.940
So in here were populating the age and so third and fought.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.450
So that's about the prepared statement.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.710
So using that,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.250
we're able to delete that particular user,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.580
and once we do that again called,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.730
comes back to the soul,

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:26.230
it and we're just simply redirecting to this so let so that would basically render the same

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.950
page,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.340
and we would see that student record getting deleted.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.110
So let's perform that operation in here.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.650
I want to delete this guy,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.300
John.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.250
Let's say we look like Dill It and sure enough is no more.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.350
His are off our school.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.850
He is now well settled.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.000
He got a new job.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.650
So that's about the deal.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.800
It maybe we'll continue from next radio.
