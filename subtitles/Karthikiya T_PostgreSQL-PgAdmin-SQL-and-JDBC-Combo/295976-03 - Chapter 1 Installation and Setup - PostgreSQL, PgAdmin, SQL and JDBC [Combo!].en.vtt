00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
All right,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.260
let us try to make use off a database software to store our applications data and make our

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.260
application more robust.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.080
So hero,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.550
the sequence of steps that we're going to follow.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.610
The first thing is to install the DBM A software which in our case,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.360
is going to be post gray.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.650
Ask your software.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250
It's a database management system,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.260
and then we'll try to use these jar files,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.450
which is Java database connectivity or simply jdb see jar files,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.700
which will help us connect to the database in order to exchange data between the business

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.350
logic as well as the database.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.750
And then we're actually going to use the structured query language to populate some data

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.710
into the database so that we can then fetch those details from our application logic.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.340
So the data that we're going to insert is the student list,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.360
and then we'll read the same from our So let so let's see how we can go about doing this.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.380
So the first thing that going to do is to install the software search for this term in

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.000
Google,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.550
download post grad school for whichever operating system you're using,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.750
and click the link whose domain name is post grayscale dot or GTA.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.730
Click on the download installer and here you get to choose abortion that you wanted to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.450
download.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.430
Obviously need to choose the latest wash in.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760
And once you do that,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.270
you also get to choose the operating system for which you want this software to be

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.000
installed.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.300
In my case,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.660
it's Window 64 bit,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.950
So I've chosen this.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.740
Once you do that click download,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.260
you would have it downloaded on your local computer.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.490
I've already done that,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.650
and this is how it's going to look like.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.410
All you have to do is to double click it,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:05.950
wait for the screen to pop up.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.500
Once it does,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.490
we can start the set up preserved by clicking next.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.150
This is going to be the installation directory if you wish,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.060
you can change it,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.570
but leave it as it is.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.570
Nothing wrong in doing so and hero various components which are going to get installed So

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.870
we have our pose grass,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.800
your server,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.580
which is the main component.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.670
This is the actual software that would be needing,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.440
but apart from that deserve additional components,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.230
which will be using as well.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.600
The PGA admin is like hair user interferes to interact with the database.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.850
I'm going to walk you through that as well.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.270
The stag builder is a tool that will help us install additional modules on top of this

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.200
components.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.050
If the post great skill is like a plain cake,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.540
then the stag builder will allow was to put some topping on the cake.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.490
So this is ideally not required.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.890
But if you would wish it can install it,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.460
let us install it may be in future.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.850
We might want to use it.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.540
The command line tools will actually help you interact with the data Best software from a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.460
command line.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.870
Now,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.860
this is equal into PG Edmon,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.800
except that this is a lighter version and you would typically run set off commands to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800
perform your respective tasks.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.830
So this is a little lightweight combat to PG admin,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.130
and I personally recommend you to use the command line tool in straw.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.170
PG admin.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.120
Since you're in the learning process.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.870
Also,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.340
another reason why I'm recommending you to use the command line is it is light with it.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.830
It's not going to consume additional RAM and CP resources.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.750
As much as speedy admin does.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.590
So Let's see what we can do about that.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.050
This is the place where the Post Grace silver is actually going to store your data.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.580
Now,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.490
when I say it's going to store the data,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.550
the data will be stored in the form that you cannot read it.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.020
For security reasons,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.680
of course,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.100
I'm going to live it to the default Click.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.740
Next,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.650
and this is very important by default.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.690
This is a user post.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.600
Greece is a user name,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.090
and you can do the passport off your preference that you can remember.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.700
What are your type in here?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.070
You're going to be using it to be able to connect to the database.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.890
This is similar to the user name and password that you do when installing the operating

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.760
system so that you can use it to log in for the first time.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.160
I'm going to give the password the same pose.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.740
Grace and I would recommend you to you the same because my examples would work with you as

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.950
well without making any changes.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.670
Click Next.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.450
This is the port where the server will be running.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.650
If you have a good reason to change it,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.250
please go ahead and change but otherwise leave it to default.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.580
You can also choose the default low car.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.000
I'd like to leave it to default as well.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.860
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.010
You can change it later on.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.940
If you wish and then our installation will start.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.380
It's going to take a while.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.050
Let me click next and then again next.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.750
While this installation is in progress,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.720
we can simultaneously take her off.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.990
Jerry.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.910
Busy drivers.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.150
So first,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.070
let us download the drivers.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.010
Pacific Jar files again.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.680
Go to Google and search for this term.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.950
Bulls Grass killer Jeb is a driver.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.550
Click on this link whose domain name is Post Greece Kildare Arc,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.970
click on download and choose the latest one.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.150
If you're still using G r E seven,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.180
then you might want to go with this.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.000
Have downloaded this and this is what I had.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.230
So in order to use this jail visit driver libraries in our project,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.790
we either have to copy this into the projects lip holder or on the service Lib folder to

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.660
use it across.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.680
All the applications have copied it inside silver's lip folder.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.880
So this is my party bomb.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.900
Got home territory have now get it inside the live directory,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.800
and I placed my jar file over here.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.750
Hair it is.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.250
So go ahead and do the same while our software is being installed.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.790
All right,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.390
we reached the end of the installation.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.100
So this is also starting the database server,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.490
creating the menu shortcuts,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.550
etcetera.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:06.450
Just take a look at all these messages and try to get a sense of what it is doing were done

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.450
.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.150
Now,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.840
we could actually keep this enabled and click finish so that we can install additional

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.660
modules.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.340
But I don't think they're required at the moment,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.270
so I can un select it and then click finish.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.080
But let me just show you what you would see.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.150
If I select it,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.800
he would get into this additional screen,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:35.250
very have to choose the silver on what you want to install the marginal click next.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:41.000
So these are additional modules and Adams that you can install,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.370
and one of the module is actually the JD visit driver that we've already downloaded.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.740
So I'm not going to be needing any off this,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.210
So just click cancel.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.450
We don't want toe instantly know that edition stuff.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.070
So that's it.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.710
We've installed our database management system pose great.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.750
Ask your and we've also set up the Jetta busy drivers to use them in our code.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.050
What comes next is too popular the student information in our database.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.850
Now there are three different ways you can do that.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.700
But no matter which way you choose,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.230
you have to use the language that you database software can understand.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.950
And that language is structured query language.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:32.450
We have multiple videos dedicated just to understand and learn about structured query

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.170
language.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.550
But just for the sake off this example,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:41.950
we're going to be using following query language to perform or task.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.450
This is actually data definition language.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:53.140
This will help us define the data that we're going to put inside our database.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.370
For example,

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.270
the piece off text that I've selected is actually going to help us define the table.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.130
In our case,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.870
it's going to be a student stable.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.000
Now Table is the Concept Off Relation database,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.960
which will talk about when we explore on database management system concepts.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.910
But for no,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.050
this is simply going to be a student table,

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.450
which has the following columns.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.370
We have I D column,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.510
the student name column,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:27.970
age and description the description is going to be off form text are in dollar terms.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.260
It's like a string,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.180
and we said it to be not now.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.900
That means we cannot have a null value specified.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.650
A student must and should have a description.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.030
Similarly,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.350
the name shouldn't be now,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.380
and age is going to be off type indigent,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.380
so we're going to be storing bunch off numbers.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.870
And then we have the I.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.660
D column,

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.050
which is said to be a primary key.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.040
We're going to talk about primary key later on.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.760
But for the completeness off this video primary key will help us uniquely identify each and

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.150
every individual row in the table.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.260
For example,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.740
if you go back to wreck associate assuming that this is how the data gets stored in the

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.560
database and if a make this particular column as primary key,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.490
then all the values that you specify here must be unique.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.970
That means you can't have double get values.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.860
For example,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.490
if you say this to be to then that's going to cause problem.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:36.900
The entry wouldn't be entertained because this column is said to be primary key and all the

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.330
values,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.550
and it has to be unique,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.240
why it has to be unique.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:47.430
That's because each and every road data will be identified with a unique identifier and in

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.880
the scares,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.480
it's going to be the serial number.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.070
Also,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.460
you can't have no values when you make a column as primary key.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.130
All right,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.180
let's go back again.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.380
We'll talk about primary key at later point of time.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.020
Just try to understand what we're doing.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.200
I'm actually going to walk you through all these as part off SQL videos,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.500
so nothing to worry.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.690
And once you create this table using data definition language,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:21.860
you need to use so called a data manipulation language that help you add entries into that

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.590
table and the way you do it by using this insert,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.910
really and later on from our application,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.720
all we're going to do is to read all the student information and display them on the

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.050
browser in some meaningful way.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.760
So in order to fish the student details,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.060
this is the SQL query that we're going to pass from our application and,

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.480
of course,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.150
by using data with drivers.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.150
So first things first,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.960
let's create our student table.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960
And as I mentioned,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.660
there are multiple ways you can do so.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.500
One is from our business logic,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.170
but for that way to use database drivers.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.050
I'm going to show it when we demonstrate this particular query.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:06.750
But the other two approaches is from so called an SQL council.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:13.500
So it for Shell and then you would come across with this SQL show.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:21.280
PS Girl Stands for Post Grass Cure This is a command line tool that will help us connect to

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.620
the database and use SQL queries to do a variety of things.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.350
Let's see how we can create our table from here.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.690
First,

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.640
you need to specify the server location.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.290
In my case,

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.860
since it's installed in my local computer,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.800
I would leave it to local host,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.050
which is the default one.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.370
And by default pose.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.940
Grace is a database which was chosen.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.060
This is a default database,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.850
which gets created when you install the software for the first time.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.890
If you created a different database,

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.750
then you would type it down here.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.990
In my case,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.860
it's default,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.510
so I would leave it like that and hit Enter the port.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:05.360
Number various over is running and the user name is going to be posed.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.280
Greece as well.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.750
If you remember when we were setting up our software,

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.390
this is what we have seen.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.490
And the password is same in my case.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.040
Hit,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.550
Enter.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.780
So so far,

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.650
we're able to connect to the database now.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.750
Way to take it off.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.050
Creating the stable.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.460
I also know that I made this idea karma cereal,

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:35.090
which means I want to auto generate the numbers in incremental in order and passed it all

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.550
here.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.950
This would create our table student table.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:40.740
No,

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.480
What we need to do next is to insert each and every individual draw into the stable,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.390
basically the student information.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.650
And as you can see here,

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:56.850
we're using the inside query and we specified the columns that we wanted to populate.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.940
We're populating student name,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.260
age and description,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.650
but we're leaving the I d part because we said it to be a serial,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.000
which will.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.300
Which means this column will now have auto generated numbers again.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.400
Will this cause about them?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.690
And we talk about structured query language.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.090
Now,

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.950
this time,

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.950
let me execute the statement using another approach.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.760
This time I'm going to be using the PG admin.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.550
So again you go to stop menu and the search for PG admin,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.700
right click on it and the neutron knitters administrator.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:42.640
It's going to take a while now.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.340
Do taken note that this is an entirely different application running on different port

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.050
altogether.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.590
So this is not going to be the port,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.280
which was specified while installing the software.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:01.180
This is a module that will help us play with the database in user friendly passion.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:07.000
So this is sort of going to provide us the graphical user interface for our database

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.750
software.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.560
Or,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.530
in other words,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.290
you can do pretty much what you can do in the common line,

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.000
but in a user friendly way.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.570
So let's try to execute,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.650
are clearly and in order takes getting to use one of these tools,

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:25.070
which is a Quito but currently is greater because we haven't yet choose in the database on

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.350
which we want to run that.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:31.520
So let's click that this is the silver.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.090
We could have multiple servers installed on multiple ports in our kids just once over,

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.370
so I'm going to click this,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.350
and then I went to choose the database where I want to run the query.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.610
So I expand this and choose the database.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.790
This is a default database.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:54.830
Let's start expanded and see what's going inside it the lot off things that are that you're

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.960
currently not aware off.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.370
We're going to uncover some of these,

00:15:59.370 --> 00:15:59.840
definitely.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.360
And in fact,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.980
I'm going to in fact,

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.540
how really are two dedicated just to understand the PG admin.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.370
But definitely we're not going to go very deep because it's not worth it.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.310
Just as an eclipse,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.940
you're not using each and every feature in here the lot off things.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.100
We didn't explore it.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.060
In fact,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:23.550
they're certain features in eclipse that I myself haven't explored till date.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.180
They're just They're just for the completeness now,

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.810
since this is an application that lets us do exclusive things,

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.150
they're also going to cover some corner cases,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.150
which are not regularly used.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.080
But still,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.000
I'm going to try to cover in a majority off these features incoming videos.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.700
But that being said,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.500
it's always better to use the command line tool because it's lightweight and is going to

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.000
take wary,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.610
lest amount of resources,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.590
or at least once you're done using PG admin,

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.910
shut it down.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.100
You can see that application in here,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.590
and you can just simply right.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.980
Click it and then stop it.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.700
One.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.960
Sudan with activity.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.820
So anyway,

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.090
let's run our query.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.190
I went to choose the database and click on these tools.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.870
Now this gets enabled.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.440
Quit tool.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.760
I'm going to paste decree,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.160
which have selected to insert an entry into the students table.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.850
So let's run this query by clicking this icon,

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.190
or you can just simply hit F five.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.350
So likewise,

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.950
Let us executor start the queries as well.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.260
To add all the entries off all the students.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.570
I already have them ready,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:49.080
so I'm just going to copy and paste them copy and business over here,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.050
and they all get executed in one goal.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.600
Something like this.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.150
Now,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.650
in order to take a look at what's inside the table,

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:01.000
you can go to the command line and say,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.250
Select star from students,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.010
and that would fetch all the student details.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.950
And this is the exact same statement that we're going to use in our program to get all the

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.010
student details.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.400
Alternatively,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.330
you can also check the same in here as part off tables.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:28.860
You can see the student table list off creates or the columns called it.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.620
Now since we're done with PG admin.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.950
Let us close it.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.260
It's a good practice.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.020
Right?

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.760
Click and then shut down Server.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.350
Yes.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.850
All right.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.650
Now,

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.760
I could actually walk you through the program,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.420
but just for your psychological satisfaction,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.070
I'm going to move it to next radio.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.820
But last night,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:57.460
I just want to mention how we can start and stop the database server plus Windows key and

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:04.680
the letter R that would prompt you this and then type in this command services dot MSC This

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.740
is going to show you a list of services that are currently running and you would be able to

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.660
find the Post Grace over who were here.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.670
And here it is.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.280
So you can either stop restart,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.480
I'll stop the service.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.740
Alternatively,

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.650
you can use the same from Windows Command line as will heal.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:37.350
The windows are type in CMD and you would say net stop and then it would provide this name

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.350
.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.860
It has to be exact.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.950
Same name was Greece cure hyphen.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:45.670
Heck,

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.660
64.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.640
I haven't done access denied.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.310
That's because Angela's this command Prosser as an administrator.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.180
So you right.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:55.760
Look on it.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:06.210
More run as administrator and tried to run the same command net.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.690
Stop both agree.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:16.500
Ask your hyphen X 64 hyphen.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:16.850
10.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.700
That this is going to stop the service.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.670
You would see the same getting reflected over here as well.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.950
You can stop this office from here or from the command line.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:35.070
But this time it only going to use Net Start Command to be able to do so.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.120
In the next week,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.430
I'm going to show you how we can access the student details from the Soviet using database

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.160
A driver.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.500
But do try to do everything what I've done so far so that you can follow along in my next

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.550
video as well.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.210
All right,

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.660
see you.
