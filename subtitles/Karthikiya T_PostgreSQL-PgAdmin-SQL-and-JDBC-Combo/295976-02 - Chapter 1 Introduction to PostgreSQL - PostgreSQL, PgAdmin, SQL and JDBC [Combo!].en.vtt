00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
all right,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.640
let's get started with understanding the data based concepts and structured query language

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:05.640
.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.710
So in next,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.790
few medios will try to get a sense off war databases,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.140
and it's uses etcetera.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.560
In fact,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.400
we're going to take a look at a couple off practical examples as well.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.520
And then we'll jump into the actual concepts of understanding the database management

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.170
system,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.950
as well as the structured query language and many more.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.210
So in this video we'll try to get a sense of what it is.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.700
Just imagine the situation where you were given the task off,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.450
creating this website Wikipedia dot org's.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.200
And as you notice that this website or Web application to be more precise,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.960
has lot of data,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.230
it has more data than the source code.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.560
So if you were to create an application like this without using a database,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.360
then he would end up having a lot off problems.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.020
One of the problems you may have is you're going to dilute this source code with lot off

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.270
content like this.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.830
This is raw text,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.960
and it makes it harder for a programmer,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.240
which is you to find the source code and make some changes to it.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.140
Another problem with this is two more.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.450
If you want to add new data,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.240
you'd have toe add not only the data,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.690
but also the source code that helped that data populate.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.100
In order to illustrate this behavior have created a very simple application,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.790
and this application is created without using a database.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.500
Let's say I was given with the task off creating a school management application.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.090
So my client asked me that he needed this application for his school,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.500
and one of the features that I would offer him is to be able to see all the list off

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.300
students available in the school.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.770
So this is how it's going to work is going to click on this button show student list.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.350
It's going to show list off students,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.490
and when he clicks on hide student list,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.080
it's going to hide the students.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.310
And the way this application is working is when I click this link,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.010
I'm actually passing this para meter show students,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.400
and I'm saying it to be true.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.090
I have a conditional statement if condition to be specific in my soul it code,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.850
and if it is true,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.060
I'm trying to display all the student information.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.620
And when I click on this link hide student list,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.650
I'm not sending any perimeter,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.570
which means,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.050
you know,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.810
the condition becomes false and I'm not showing anything.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.140
Let's see how the score looks in ourselves.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.950
It So this is how it's going to look like we have our two links along with the perimeter,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.850
and I'm displaying all the student details.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.320
Now,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.330
take a look at this.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.980
Take a look at this big mess.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.710
If you write source code like this,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.750
then soon you would find yourself searching for a new job.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.170
Nobody would like to keep a programmer who writes code like this.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.430
I mean,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.390
take a look at this.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.610
I'm mixing board the data,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.310
the raw text as a last the source code.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.570
The problem with this is all that.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.580
This is very simple application.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.050
Just imagine writing an application like Wikipedia,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.860
which has lot off text in it.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.540
And if you were to populate all the text as part of your source code like we did here,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.460
then definitely it becomes harder for me to find the source code in my job.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.310
A file and Makesem edits,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.350
and it is very much error prone as well.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.180
And let's say my client,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.260
who owns a school academy or whatever,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.900
is going to ask me to add a few more students.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.000
He can't do it by himself.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.880
He need to request me to add the students,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.190
and I have to make it.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.150
It's in my source scored to be able to do that,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.510
and again it becomes a big headache to make changes to my source code.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.630
I would never,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.850
ever would like to take a look at a source code like this.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.850
So how can we solve these problems?

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.290
We can solve these problems by separating the data from the actual source score or the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.320
business logic.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.210
So I came up with this idea off storing data separately into an Excel sheet.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.350
For example,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.110
I have this associate where I have populated only the data.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.090
This does not have my source code,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.380
and I'm going to write a soul.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.840
It whose source code is going to look something like this.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.000
Now,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.880
this is just an imaginary code.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.530
This is not actually working good.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.440
But essentially,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.630
this is what I would be doing in my source code.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.050
I would create an object off the excel.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.850
She it when it's an object off next social,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.070
you're going to make use off some external libraries.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.850
In fact,

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.450
we have taken a look at one such example where we're able to read the data from the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.050
associate have expended in my Cordova tutorial.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.970
So I'm going to create an object.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.710
And then I'll try to get list off Rose,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.950
which will be list off students like you see here.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:13.350
And then I'm going to have another for loop where I would loop through all the individual

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.170
cells in each row.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.910
Like so.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.850
So in each and every rule we have multiple cells.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.150
I'm just going to look through all of them,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.080
and I'm just simply going to display them in a certain format.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.070
Well,

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.890
this has actually sold our problems,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.910
so I'll have my source code in my soul.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.820
It and data in an ex associate.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.890
So tomorrow,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.240
if I want Makesem edits,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.730
I don't have to look at the data in my source code.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.400
Also,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.890
my client does not need to ask me to add new students.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.560
He can do it by himself.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.750
He can just add an entry in the associate,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.850
and he's quite familiar with using extra sheets anyway,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.730
and then my court will take her off populating the student information.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.100
Added to that,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.410
this has also reduced the number of fines off court involved.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.620
I don't have to add this set off lines for each and every student that will all be taken

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.950
care by these looping constructs.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.370
So our problems are sold,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.130
right?

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.450
Not really.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.450
We got additional problems.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.160
In fact,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.890
although this has reduced the number of lines off court,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.530
it has increased the complexity.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.790
And again imagine that you want to write an application like Wikipedia.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.390
How can you put so much off data in an ex associate?

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.070
It's going to cost a lot off performance.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.540
I mean,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.040
if you're used to using X OSI,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.560
it's You must have observed that if you have too much off data in an ex associate,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.930
you can't even scroll up and down and let alone managing data like Wikipedia etcetera.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.840
And moreover,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.000
it's going to take a lot of space.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.720
Even an empty document without any data is going to consume some space because it needs

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.950
space for itself.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.310
Another problem,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.100
associate ID,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.360
by using an associate is security.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.100
Somebody else can actually take a look at your content inside this Excel sheet.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.080
And if it is some sense to information like passwords,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.580
that's going to be a real problem.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.390
We can address the problem off efficiency by using the maximal sheets,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.550
which are little lightweight compared to exercise it,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.010
but still rest off.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.660
The problems are going to remain.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.040
So what is the solution to this problem?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.210
Obviously,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.710
a database management system.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:38.170
So a database management system is a software that is specifically tuned to help you manage

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.010
your data for your applications.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.210
So some of the soft rest that are available in the industry and these are some of the

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.800
popular ones There are many,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.410
actually.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.750
But these are some of the database management system software's,

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.350
which will help you manage data for your applications.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.440
We have a pretty popular one,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.010
which is or it'll database.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.340
We have one from Microsoft Gassville,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.420
Microsoft SQL Server,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.050
and this is the one that we're going to be using pose Greer skill.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.260
And finally,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.460
my SQL is one of the popular ones as well.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:18.660
So all these Softwares will actually help you address the problems that we had talked about

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:18.660
,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.350
and in addition to that,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:27.050
they're actually going to add value to application by providing all this set of features,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.220
they are for more security.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.390
There are for better performance.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.060
They help us maintain data consistently.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.550
We're going to talk about data consistency.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.530
Then we get into the concepts off data,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.760
best management systems and it would L.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:42.810
A.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:48.750
Was to have these off access to the data by using so called a structured query language.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.150
We'll talk about it,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.440
and basically it's going to offer better transaction management.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.990
Now it is everything is transactions being flight booking,

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.720
application or banking system or whatever.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.750
Everything is transaction based.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.350
So we'll talk about all of them in detail pretty soon.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.260
So basically doesn't matter what software that you use,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.980
they're all going to sell the same purpose off managing your data.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:23.730
But mice person suggestion is to follow along with me and make use off pose Greece cure.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.120
So now why don't we just go to our white board and take a look at what we're trying to

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.590
accomplish using this data basis?

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.150
So we'll have our business logic,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.160
which in our case,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.760
we're using a soul it and will install so called a database management system hard simply

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.680
DBM s.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.790
This could be Oracle database or my a skill.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.580
Or in our case,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.080
it's going to be posed.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.320
Agree.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.450
Ask your software.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.300
Once you install your database software,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.800
there is one additional step to be able to let your application communicate with the

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.620
database.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.060
And that step is installing so called a driver typical.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.230
It would be J.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.350
D.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.040
B C drivers,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.810
and you need to install and driver that is specific to the software that install.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.100
If instruct was great,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.910
ask your than you would need to have its corresponding drivers according Leaf Install.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.380
Say my SQL server.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:27.730
You need install my SQL database drivers so the driver is actually kind off.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:33.440
Act like a glue court between your business logic and the data best management system so

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.260
that the both can talk to each other.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.600
This is synonymous.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.910
Do installing it driver for your printer,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.900
for example.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.250
You have your computer and you would buy a printer.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.430
If you connect your printer to computer,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.880
would they talk to each other?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.750
The sprinter work right away.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.060
The answer is no.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.730
It doesn't.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:57.670
You'd have to install so called a driver software that's going to make these two entities

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.450
compatible to each other.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.650
And that's exactly what we have here in order to make this two entities compatible to each

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.890
other when it installed so called a driver software.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.520
Now,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.070
when I say install,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.670
we're going to install it in program away,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.840
not any exit file,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.430
that you can just double click and click next,

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.700
next,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.040
next.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.540
It's not going to work that way.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.290
We're out of that comfort zone.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.530
We're now programmers.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.670
But that being said,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.760
it's not a big deal at all.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.250
I'm going to show you I'm going to walk you through anyway.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.110
So once you have that rapid buildup between these two entities,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.640
you can let your business logic communicate with database management system.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.150
But how are you going to communicate with the dead of best?

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.680
You had to come to get with the language that the database software will understand,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.830
and that language is nothing but a structured query language.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.900
We have multiple videos dedicated to learn ask.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.270
You'll,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.680
in fact owe the most part.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.370
We're going to focus on a school because no matter what database software the to install

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.690
one thing is going to remain consistent.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.690
That structured query language so tomorrow.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.160
If you want to change your vendor,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.260
maybe from post Greece to maybe wanted to switch to my school,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.700
you don't have to change your SQL queries.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.170
It's going to remain same.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.440
The only thing that you need to change is the driver software.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.330
So anyway,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.050
more on it later.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.060
So once you have everything set up using a skill queries,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.750
you can perform crowd operations see for create,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:34.090
which means you can create some entities inside your database.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.060
In our example,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.260
it's going to be students table.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.210
Or you can do read operation,

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.220
which means we'll try to read the data from the database in your application and do

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.040
something with it.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.980
Or you could do update.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.050
You may want to change an entry in your table or deal it.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.800
You may want to delete some entry from your table.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.190
Now,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.950
for the sake of this example,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.620
I'm just saying that we have single table,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.430
but in reality there are hundreds off tables,

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.570
and that's where,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.940
and that's why we have database management system to handle all that complexity.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.120
So for next few,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.650
we'd Eos we're actually going to try to get a sense off how we can make use off database

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.900
software's and the problem it Saul's.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.760
And then we'll jump into the concepts of understanding DB Emma's and structured query

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.550
language,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.420
and that would suffice,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.750
so stay tuned.
