00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
in this video,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.630
we're going to take a look at some of the objects present as part off a schema.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.000
Now,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.280
when I say schema,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.390
I don't mean to say the logical schema which designers will use.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.370
I'm talking about the physical schema which is here have already mentioned about physical

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.150
and logical schema in my earlier videos.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.630
So essentially a schema,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.840
I mean,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.160
the physical scheme is essential,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.760
like a folder that holds various types off files.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.290
In here we have this default schema,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.940
which is public and is holding all these different types off objects.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.160
And we're all the river or some of these objects.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.050
For instance,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.660
we got table objects are we have functions.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.630
In fact,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.530
you can actually create a new schema,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.850
and that would be like creating a new folder.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.110
Let's give it some name,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.020
you save it and now you have to scheme us again.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.070
You would be able to see all the objects that are responding to the schema and also note

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.550
that whenever you're tryingto create an object using the Wizard,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.350
the auto generated quote actually,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.410
for example,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.010
I'm trying to introduce a new column New table here and the SQL is actually is very formal

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.010
.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.600
It is saying the schema name dot the table name,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.450
and this is how you would actually create at table or run any other SQL queries.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.250
You would use this scheme on name just as you see here,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.730
so that's about the schema.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.030
But no,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.500
let's talk about various different objects.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.250
Present threat.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.850
Let me just delete this quickly.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.150
We don't need it.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.390
First.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.640
Let's talk about domains.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.880
Creating a domain is more or less like creating a new data type with some constraints.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.790
Where Michelle What?

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.320
I mean,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.650
let's try to create a domain using this wizard.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.050
Let's call it new domain.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.050
The definition is where we provide the data type.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.790
It's going to be off type indigent,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.620
for instance,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.300
and constant is what makes domains unique from a normal data type.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.230
Here.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.050
We can actually specify Let's give it,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.590
Ah,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.750
any name,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.450
Let's say cones or whatever,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.490
and you have to say values.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.800
This is a key word or value.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.420
This is a key with that in to use here to provide your condition,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.040
the value should be,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.050
say,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.560
less than 30 file.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.490
Let's I want to put a restriction on my student stable that there shouldn't be a student

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.780
whose age is greater than 35.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.210
So I can certainly use this domain on the field.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.750
And here is the Inspector SQL Statement.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.050
Create domain with some additional data.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.650
You can always click this question mark in each and every desert that you come across with

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.230
so that that will take you to the documentation off the desert.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.670
Or,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.650
if you'd like to take a look at the Heskey awash in off doing the same thing and you can

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.250
click this I icon and that would take you to that place just as you see here.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:28.100
Looks like a distinct while anyway can check it if you wish.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.280
So I'd like to save this and let's try to use this domain that were created.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.850
Let's close closed.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.350
I've been trying to create a new table.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.260
Let's call it,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.750
uh,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.350
some name when Dad Two columns.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.340
One is I D.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:00.680
And I'm going to make this cereal to auto generate it and I'm going to add a mother field

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.420
age,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.240
for instance.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.450
And this time I'm going to choose the domain which have just created you would see it

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.240
getting populated over here and Let's click.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.000
Save now Let's try to add an entry into this table.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.400
I would be fresh and you would get this.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.620
Currently,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.950
there's no data as you expect.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.790
Let's open the quit it,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.260
too,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.100
and entered some data in it.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:40.450
I would say Insert into some name age values.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.660
Hey is going to be,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.130
say,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.950
25.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.020
And let's end the statement on the Cleary and it works.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.390
Well,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.950
let me just try to insert a rally that is greater them 35.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.580
This time it fails.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.960
Value for domain Nudelman violates check constraint.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.640
Cons.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.150
So that essentially means we're able to put some restrictions on that column.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.250
And let's take a look at the columns and you don't see that.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.450
So that's where the main will come into picture.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.120
Let's do it.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.950
The stable.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:24.670
Now let's talk about materialized views.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.320
Remember,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.740
we had talked about extracting the data from another table and creating a new table.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.520
But using create table table name as and then the query,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.640
for example,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:50.390
you would say create table some name as and you would pour the query select star from

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.250
students That's run it,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:01.100
and this has created this table with the content which is currently present in the students

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.650
table.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.580
All well and good,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.400
but this is going to remain permanent.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.450
We can't refresh this table and get the latest updated values from the store in stable,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.290
for example,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.350
for add an entry in students Table.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.150
Let's say when died Uh,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:32.210
45 and some name and some fee and click Save the same thing will not get reflected over

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.850
here.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.950
Pretty obvious,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.300
but we can certainly make use off of you.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.500
We already have our view created in one off for videos.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.020
So let us try to use this.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.010
Let me do sell it star.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.550
From my view,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.410
that's run it now.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.330
The data that you're seeing here is fresh.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.900
The moment I click this button to execute the query,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.750
the view is going to actually run the internal query that we had set in the view to extract

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.650
the Quran data.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.490
So if it make changes to the students table,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.700
it would get reflected here as well.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.190
But coming to materialized views it's going to be different.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:29.020
It is similar to create table as but the difference is we can all this update the data with

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.280
the current data on demand remission.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.460
What?

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.040
I mean,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.650
so I took on this.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.040
I'm going to say M view for metalized view.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.370
In the definition,

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.950
I went to provide my query.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:56.050
I would say select student name and age from students as simple as that.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.750
And then here is a resultant has skill.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.670
Again,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:07.720
this is something that we can use to create a materialized view.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.650
You would say,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.470
create materialize view,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.650
and then you would provide all the details.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.580
And do they not off distinct here with no data?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:23.100
Meaning we're creating a metalized view without any data in it.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.750
If there is no data in it,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.840
we cannot view it.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.970
Let me show you what I mean.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.870
It's our public sale installed my view,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.830
I would say m view he can't view its data.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.210
It shows than ever has not been populated.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.020
So we need to populate the data.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.650
And the way you go about doing it is you would rather use this command refresh materialized

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.750
view,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.470
command,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.990
and then you would provide the view name when we just quickly do it.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:01.730
So you would do this now This would petrol information from the students table and it gets

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.690
populated alternatively,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:09.050
can know to do the same from here by saying Refresh view with data.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.280
So no,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.390
let's try do first that data and you would be able to see.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.700
Of course,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.470
it's supposed to be M view.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.650
So here is the data,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.950
and if I make updates through the actual Stewart unstable,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.020
it won't get reflected here on July.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:34.200
Demand this view to be refreshed with the updated data.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.970
So that's about the materialized views.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.950
And then we know about tables.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.950
Let's talk about sequences.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.530
We already got couple of sequences created.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.140
Basically,

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.050
these are the sequences Rive used in students and course table.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.110
These are kind of part of generated,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.870
if you notice in both these tables.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.690
We had actually used the key word cereal on her i.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.520
D column.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.420
The serial is going to generate auto generator values incriminated by Valley one,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.210
and this is where it is defined.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:17.370
If you go to the properties off the sequences to go definition for courses table the crane

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:24.100
values for because they're just for interest in that and the valley is going to get

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.520
increment it by one for the attic.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.650
Calm off course,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.040
and the minimum value is one.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.510
That's where that's a starting number for the sequence.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.300
The maximum is going to be this.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:43.890
The Cash Valley is amount off ideas that will get auto generated and get stored in the

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.100
local cache memory,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.260
so that will basically contribute in performance.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.780
Not very noticeable,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.170
though,

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.640
but you can increase the value if you wish.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.510
But let's try to create a new sequence.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:06.710
Let's say that I want to generate a sequence where the number will get incremental did by

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.340
three.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.250
In the definition,

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.900
I'm going to provide the increment value.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.480
It's going to be three.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.590
The starting value is going to be,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.110
say,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.220
10 minimum values.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.400
10 Maxwell use,

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.230
say 1000 account exceed more than 1000.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.080
Let's say I would say Kasher to be one,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.060
and here is a skill to create a sequence.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.810
Again.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:39.850
You can click this two icons at the question mark that expense about this reserve or this I

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.440
icon.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.560
The talks about ah,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.760
the create sequence command that you can run either in PG admin or BS Cure.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.050
Let's see of it and try to use it.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:56.790
So let me pause the video and create a query quickly to save your time.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.750
and then I'll get back.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:05.480
So here is the query that I'm going to use to create a table which uses that sequence.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.250
I'm going to copy this and pasted in or query processor.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.510
So as that create table new table,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.650
we're going to have a couple of feels idea and the name the ideas off type indigent in this

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:24.510
primary key and the defaults to the cereal that you have just created and do taken note of

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.700
the ski would next.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.170
Well,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.870
you have to use this keyboard with,

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.250
ah,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:34.510
the name of the sequence that you have created and the name is off type text that's run the

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.080
query,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.370
and we seem to have some problem.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.400
Let's get it on this semi colons here and it booked.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.180
Now let's try to insert some data in it and when to use.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.650
Insert key word for that,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:55.190
and I'm going to just insert the name because I deserted generated.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.690
Based on this video,

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.390
I'm going to insert multiple values.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:08.810
And if you take a look at the data that gets populated here and the sequence looks like I

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:09.950
opened the wrong table,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.700
let me refresh,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.450
and here it is,

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.970
okay,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:20.480
looks like,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.750
for some reason or sequins didn't take effect.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.040
Let's see,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.660
for configurations are intact and unfortunately,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.150
our conflagration seemed to have not saved.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.200
So let's make changes to this.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.650
An increment by three.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.560
So let's save it.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.320
Minimum value is going to be,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.180
Let's keep it to one.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.000
Maybe I have given something wrong in the previous prompt,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.890
and so sequence defaulted to the default values.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.850
So let's save this this time and try to insert the data again,

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.250
going back to our insert query.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.930
Before that,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.750
let me just get it off the existing data.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:18.770
Thank God populated and two had delete.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.250
And then let's from this query,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:29.550
And this time it worked.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.450
So that's about the sequence.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.500
You can define your own sequence if you wish,

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.990
and that's pretty much shaped.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.000
But we haven't talked about some of the other objects present in here,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.730
because whether they are to add once at the moment and is majorly meant for database

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.800
administrators,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.060
people who dedicate the carrier working on databases,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.600
for example,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.450
if you're talking about after years or full text search,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.690
it is sort of way of configuring the text search mechanism,

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:08.470
and that is useful for search engines to efficiently find the date and is specifically more

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.750
useful for Web applications.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.010
Whose date eyes were you up to date?

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.040
For instance,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.900
news channels.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:20.600
They would need to enable all these features in order for search engines to efficiently

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.030
find the updated daytime their website.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:31.840
So this would definitely is not going to help us and coming to types.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.920
These are some advance data types,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.850
for example,

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.780
and numerous in type etcetera,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.960
composite type again desire off.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:49.380
Not very relevant for I developer like us and coming to foreign tables,

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.370
it would best Korea love you to populate tables from a different database,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.820
for example,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:01.950
to go to definition Here is very appropriate departments ever.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:08.060
Now this several could be an Oracle server Oracle database over my skill or whatever it is

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.060
,

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:14.750
you could populate its tables in read only mode so that we can work with it.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.450
So that's it on all these objects.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.050
I think we've talked about the primary ones.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.430
In fact,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.300
we're talk more than what is necessary to be honest.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.380
So that's it on this video.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.500
See you soon
