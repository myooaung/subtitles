00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
All right,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.550
let us take a look at some of the SQL statement that helps us do something on the table

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.970
creatively,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.490
something that we had already talked about.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.970
But what's new is create table.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.470
As so this is the create tables and that's ready.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.470
Straight forward,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.200
coming toe,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.670
create table as it will letters perform or execute a query whose result would then be

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.880
populated in the new table.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.530
An example of what?

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.190
You can see it over here as it create table.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.430
I give some random name as and I would have some kind of a query here.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.460
In this case,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.140
I said,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.350
sell its star,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.420
which is Ah,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.250
wildcard symbol from Students Table,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.250
where students age is greater than 28.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.860
Whatever is the result would then be stored onto this new table along with its fields or

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.770
attribute.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.630
So let's see how we can execute this statement.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:19.290
Let's go toe r p g admin that's copied this statement and bested in the query processor who

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.150
and run it.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.850
So this has created a table,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.750
went to refresh the database and you would see the new table here.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.180
This,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.070
And if you look inside the continent off the table,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.290
you would see all the students whose age is greater than 28.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.650
But the reason why you're not seeing any data is because if you go to the students table,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.490
you would notice that there are no students whose age is greater than 28.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.370
They're all 28 So let's try to change the query.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.920
But before that,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.580
let us drop the step or delete the stable from here and then read on the query again.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
So I go toe created tool again.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.370
I would face the same query,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.980
but this time I'm going to say it's a greater than 27 and this time you should see the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.600
result taking effect.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.740
So here is a table all rose,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.970
and you would see all the list off students.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.750
So all those students are kind of old students.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.500
In our case,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.830
let's go back the altar table Key world would actually help you after the table as simple

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.420
as that.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.580
For example,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.850
using altar table,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.240
you can actually had a column to the existing table or dropping column are really in the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.800
table.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.060
Or maybe change the constraint off the table.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.870
Attribute etcetera.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.850
You can do a variety of things with it.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.590
Let's try to understand one by one in here,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.030
this instruction would actually add a new column toe the students table with the name E

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.550
mail,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.080
and its data type is text.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.960
I'm not going to run each one of these instructions because I believe they're pretty

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.950
straight forward.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.680
And then we have all the table students drop column,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.650
which means we want to delete a particular column from the Students table in the Scarce.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.590
It's the column email.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.650
We want to get it off this attribute off the table,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.750
and we can also rename the column off the table and the skills.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.750
We want to change the name of the column email to student email,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.770
and this is how you do it.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.950
You can alter the table name itself like so.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.410
Like I said,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.110
we can also add constraints on existing field,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.400
like I did here.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.000
In this case,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.930
I said in the students table,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.450
I want this to combined together as a primary key.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.490
If you just want only one attribute to be acting as a primary key,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.350
it can specify only one in here.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.350
You can also change the data type off a particular field like we did here.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.460
In this case,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.660
we're trying to change the data type off email field,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.050
Tovar Car versus text,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.250
which was the case earlier.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.480
You can even alter the database name and change it to something else,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.150
just as I did here.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:56.280
So these are basically the operations that you can perform to change the definition off the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.890
table.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.480
There are many more keyboard,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.470
so chicken news.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.300
If you want to take a look at the complete reference off all the table,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.150
then you can go to this link.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:21.550
This is official was great skill dot org's website,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.300
and you can pretty much see everything that you can run on.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.440
Pause Grass Cure.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.190
If you search for older table and click this,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.160
you would say the complete reference.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.900
I thought these were set off key words that you can use in the statement to do a variety

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.650
off things.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.620
Just take a look at it,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.280
get us,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.660
and so,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.050
for it's what they're doing.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.710
Nothing fancy.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.790
Pretty straightforward.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.050
Let's go back.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:58.570
Let's take a look at how you can go about leading a table or it's row or database conducive

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.570
.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.490
By using this word drop drop table and optionally ca NSI.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.460
If exists,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.450
students,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:14.180
this instruction would dilate the stable or better it for the sake of performance,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.200
especially if you have a huge amount of data and your table.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.510
Then insert off saying drop table.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:28.620
You're better use trunk it table that would delete the table in most efficient manner just

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.110
to save some performance.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.880
So I guess that's it on this video.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.650
See you in my next video.
