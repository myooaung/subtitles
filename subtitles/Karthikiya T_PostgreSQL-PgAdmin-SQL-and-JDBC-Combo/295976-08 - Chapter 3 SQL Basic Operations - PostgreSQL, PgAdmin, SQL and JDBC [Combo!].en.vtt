00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.950
How could this very is kind of like a starter video to get started with structured query

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.600
language?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.520
So we're basically going to take a look at some of the basic operations that you can

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.950
perform on the database using SQL language.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.150
So we'll take a look at how we can create a table,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.330
read the content from the table,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.980
abrade the table and delete some content from the table.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830
And for these purposes,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
I've chosen four different types off instructions that you can use.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.430
So let us take a look at them.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.500
If you want to take a look at the same documented can defer to the stockman that's is 01

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.210
basic.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.380
Ask your and then you would be able to see the same.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.680
So here's a syntax for creating a table you'd use this key would create space table,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.490
and then you would provide the name off your choice.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.250
Basically,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.050
this is going to be the name off the table,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.680
and then you would have the name of the column.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.480
This could be any name that you would restrict you,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.250
and we may have constraints.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.850
Has an example of this line in here.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.440
You can see it here,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.250
for example,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.260
for the column I.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.230
D were play the constant,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.950
which is the primary key.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.440
And we're saying Serial,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.630
which means we want toe auto.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.760
Generate its value by implementing the number by one,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.380
and you can also have a column with some type and then optionally can specify a constraint

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.380
.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.550
We've done the same thing here,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.950
has it student name and the type of the content that we can store in this attribute is text

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.950
.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.650
The domain off student name is text,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.430
and then we put a constant saying that the values shouldn't be no for this column,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.930
so similarly have mentioned rest of the fields that would describe or construct my students

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.930
.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.440
Stable Optionally can also use this word inherits and then you specify the name of the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.710
older,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.780
existent table.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.150
That way,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.350
the students table will not only have all these columns or attributes,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.320
but also had two birds that are part off the table it inherits.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.470
This is optionally can get it on this if you wish,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.150
but do make sure that you end the statement with a semi colons.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.310
It's under those changes,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.510
so let's see how we can execute this statement.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.450
There are two ways you can do so.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.480
One is from the PG admin or P SQL Shell provided by deposed grass Cure.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.750
So let's first launch or Post Grad school shell.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.850
Just search for Shell,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.460
and you'd be able to find P SQL or SQL Shell.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.450
Just click it.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.390
You would specify the location off your silver.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.890
In my case,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.860
it's local host,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.250
so that's the default.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.300
And that's where you see this being highlighted in the square.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.370
Brackets hit,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.610
written or enter.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.240
Specify the name of the database.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.770
In my case,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.740
I'm still using the default database.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.650
Post grace out head enter port number better over your silver is running.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.790
In my case,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.430
I've left it to default while installing the software the user name is going to be.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.390
They use the name with which we can log in to this database and perform certain operations

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.650
if he's entitled to.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.100
In my case,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.280
this is the default is a name.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.340
If you had followed my instructions on installing the software,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.600
then it should do exact same steps that's it enter and would be asked to enter the password

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.600
.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.410
Give the passport that you have given while installing the software are the passport off

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.150
the user name that you've entered.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.210
In my case,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.890
it's same post Greece hit.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.350
Enter.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.770
Now you have logged in the post,

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.250
Chris.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.430
Alternatively,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.000
gone also just to log in from PG Admin Council.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.510
But make sure that when you're launching this application,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.930
right click on it,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.250
goto more and run as administrator.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.050
And once you do that,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.400
he would have a browser console that looks something like this.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.660
All right.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.610
Now let's see how weaken execute our instructions and went to copied this from here to

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.600
create a table.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.670
And let's see how we can execute from the PS cure.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.140
You can just try to the best it'll here.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.980
But the problem is,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.130
we have already created the table students.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.910
You could change the name and run.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.650
It alternatively,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.670
can also do the same from PG admin as well.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.210
So you expand the list off so was available.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.840
If you're seeing this cross saying,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.170
that means we haven't yet connected to the server from this PD admin console.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.650
So the very connect to that's ovaries.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.970
You right.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.680
Click on it.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.850
Click Connect us over.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.360
You may be asked with user name and password.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.250
If so,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.840
go ahead and enter your user name and password.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.170
Expand the data basis.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.760
Here we have list of databases and my case is just one would expand that goto scheme us

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.550
public and you would be able to see list off tables available,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.340
expand them,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.060
and we are able to see the students table.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.630
So let's create another.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.350
I would choose the database where I would like to create my table and I go to tools.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.710
Excuse me.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.940
I need to choose a database and then I go to tools,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.290
Click on Query Tool and past your Quindio here.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.200
But of course you need to change the name to something else.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.850
I would say,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.660
Let's name it some name.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.490
Whatever you would like to give and try not to do space here.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.820
Just use underscored instant office space in case if you would like to use more than one

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.210
word for your table name,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.480
Um,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.350
whatever.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:15.050
And then click this icon that looks like a flash icon or thunder or whatever dislike it,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.750
or you could alternately hit F five that would do the same job.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.450
So guess what we have now created at table.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.640
He won't see it here because went to refresh right click and hit refresh,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.550
and you're able to see the table over here.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.200
What comes next is the read operation.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.500
But in order for us to perform the read operation with the first update,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.070
the table with some content.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.480
So we're going to use this one of the upgrade instructions,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.980
which is insert it will allow us to insert at pupil or a role indoor table.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.230
We also have another key word that says update and using that keep what he would be able to

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.750
make edits to the existing row in the table.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.900
But in this case that has use insert,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.700
the entered statement would have the pouring syntax.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.760
You would say Insert into you would provide the table name where you would like to perform

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.510
the insert operation your specialist off columns for what you want,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:33.530
update the values and then you use this key would values and again in parentis is your

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.170
provide list off values now do taken note that the first value that you provide corresponds

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.950
to the first column that you provide here,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.910
same as with other columns.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.850
The second value maps to the second column so on and so forth.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:55.450
Now here's instruction that helps is insert some data into a table.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.400
I went to copy it,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.620
but this time let us run from P s school.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.590
Just paste it here.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.590
But before that,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:09.550
let me open the North bad and change the table name too.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.150
Some name,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.770
because that's what we have created out.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.350
Copy this and then tested over here.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.510
The problem is,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.470
I've given the name incorrectly.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.380
The right name is you can use the command show tables for this purpose.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.550
Show tables.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.540
Okay,

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.020
Basically,

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.190
I've used the command we used in my skill.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.370
But for pose great,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.480
it's going to be different.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:47.350
We have to say slash DT and that would list all the list off tables available in the

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.320
current schemer or the crime database.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.420
We're going to take a look at a list of commands that you can run from P a skill that's

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.910
part off the course as well.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.760
So here's the name.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.980
So let us use the same name while trained.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.050
Insert the data.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.530
We got the name wrong there.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.000
But let's use it anyway.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.110
It's,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.650
um,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.050
some a n m P.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.410
Now that has inserted the values in the table.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.050
Now we can actually go ahead and read the data from the table.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.530
By using this instruction,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:33.120
select the list off column that you would like to take a look at from the table name

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.410
example of which is demonstrated here.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:41.350
This instructional letters Take a look at these two attributes off the table.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.520
Students are If you'd like to take a look at the entire table,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.310
all the columns are that tributes involved in the table.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.350
Then you're just simply use this star.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.160
It's a wildcard.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:06.360
So let's go back to PS School and say Select star from some name and with the semicolon and

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.320
hit enter and you're able to see here.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.350
Now let's see how we can accomplish the same from the PG admin.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.280
So we're here.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:29.230
Some name you'd right click on it and then choose View Added data all rose Here.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.850
We're able to see that data.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.850
Let us populate new data.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.580
Just click on the field that you would like to populate and do take note that I'm not going

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:43.190
to populate the I d feel because we want auto generate the values so would leave it alone.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.150
And with public the name let's say the name to be some,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.210
um,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.800
apple or whatever.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.530
Let's give him meaningful human name soon There,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.650
for example,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.350
and you hit save.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.210
But when you try to save this table,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.380
we're going to get a never.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.140
Because if you remember,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.640
we said our description not supposed to be No.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.650
So we're forced to enter some value here in the description.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.130
So let's do that.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:23.250
Let's click this errors that it will go away and then populate this some description and it

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:23.750
saved.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.150
We're going to hit Save here as well.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.680
No errors.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.390
And you can see that some I d got generated already.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.360
So this is the way you would insert data from the PG admin.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.450
Both are same at the you do it from P s killer.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.140
From here,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.680
the only difference is from PD admin.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.050
You'd have this use interface without having to write the SQL instruction.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.340
And that's the very reason why I would like to suggest you to use PS kill for learning

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.060
purposes.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.230
You would get to write the complete SQL statement which will help you learn things better

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:04.160
than you do when you use a graphical user interface from PG admin.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.520
this gives you a little comfort.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.980
And I don't like you to be in comfort zone,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.730
especially when you're learning.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.550
Correct.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:17.800
So let's see how we can delete the record from the table which is coming next.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.730
We're taking a look at create read update and now we're going to take a look at the delete

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.450
operation.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.320
The village instruction will have the fallings in tax,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.320
Deal it from table name and you provide the condition,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.160
for example.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.950
The condition in this example is I d to I want to delete a row from the students stable

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:53.350
whose I d is set to its competence instruction and go back to a the PS kyul r two RPG edin

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.350
.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.900
So I would open the query tool.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:04.950
We have based instruction here Possible Exchange the table name too some.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.380
It's I guess it's a enemy.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.130
Sorry about that.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.750
I got the name wrong and we're struggling here and there.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.590
So let me make this three and run the query.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.080
It worked.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:25.960
Let us do refresh And let's take a look at the data that gets populated in here and you

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.670
would see that particular role missing since we've deleted it.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.990
So this is about the basic operations.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.240
This week is just to give you a sense off how we can make yourself structured query,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.790
language,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.450
etcetera.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.430
But from this point on,

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:48.110
I'm not going to be running all the skill statements from the PG admin or from the PS

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.040
school because we have instructions.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.350
Where would be requiring to make use off multiple tables,

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.410
and it becomes very complex at times.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:05.630
I cannot explain in better fashion if I won't execute all those statements from PG admin or

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.340
PS Cure.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.130
I would rather give an example.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.750
Table in here,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:17.630
right here in this world document and our Babel to explain you in better fashion have

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.780
experimented it,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.280
and I thought it wouldn't work.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.550
I can explaining better fashion from this document,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.670
but sure enough,

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.890
we're going to talk about some of the other features,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.830
as in when they come.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.120
For example,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.150
I'm going to show you how we can go about creating users.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.070
Heardem creating a making use off functions,

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.200
for instance,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:43.750
like was,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.450
we're going to explore some of these features for sure are.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.020
In fact,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.880
we're going to explore all the major,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.760
popularly used features from PG admin,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.080
Asil,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.670
SPS girl and added to that not to mention that s girl is,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.110
ah,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.050
language.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.880
Which means it has lot off key words that we can use equal in number of words in the

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.580
dictionary.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:06.990
Well,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.580
not really,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.540
but I mean to say that there are too many words that we just can't discuss each and every

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.220
one off them.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.320
That being said,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.210
as usual,

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:20.300
have planned to discuss everything that are used regularly in the industry.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:25.920
So we're going to continue to talk about structured query language to the most part,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.650
will be spending our time with the word document.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.980
But if I find that I can explain things in better fashion using PG admin,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.490
then I would definitely do so without hesitation.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.820
All right,

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.670
we have many things to cover.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.510
Let us make some smart moves.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.750
See you soon.
