00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
in this.

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.950
Who they were going to talk about views?

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.640
Well,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.470
rather than taking a look at this definition and bang,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.070
Go ahead,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.400
Let us try to understand view with the real world example letter that I own a school and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.710
the school management software and I happen to use pose great skill as my database software

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800
and as a super user.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.280
I've logged into the software,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.810
and I execute this query to see a list of all the students in my school.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.510
No,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.040
let's say one off.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.680
My subordinate are another lecture.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.750
Wants to get the names off people or students whose ages 28 maybe he need to talk to the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.610
students.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.380
No,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.360
I could actually give my credentials the Super user credentials and let him access this

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.040
database.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.590
But obviously it's not secure,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.350
so certainly that's not an option.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.460
The another option is we could create a new user with restricted access.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.570
Maybe we would allow him only to view the students but not make any changes to the stable.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.210
But that will introduce another problem.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.060
For example,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.190
he also can see all the sense to information like fee or a description about the student

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.950
etcetera.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.590
I only want him to see the names off students whose ages 28.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.260
So how can I hello,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.090
that to happen?

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.260
The answer is views.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.870
If you would let me represent data from one or more tables with some limitations,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.300
let me show you what I mean.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.970
First,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.910
let's create a view and the very do It is pretty simple.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.150
I'll say Create view and I'll give the view name.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.100
I'll call it my view as And what comes next is a query.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.380
This could be a very simple query.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.710
Our could get very complex.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.550
I already have an example off query where we're displaying the names of students whose age

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.500
is equals 28.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.850
So let's go back and pissed it all here and run our query.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
This has essentially created a view.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.930
No,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.030
let me just simply try to display this view by saying Select Star,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.090
basically,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.060
just as you would display table,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.880
it would display of you by using the Selic statement Select star from your view name that's

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.450
run it,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.820
and you would notice that the result doesn't have the information about their fee or the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.150
description etcetera.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.150
And in fact you can see this view getting populated in here in the view section.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.280
Now guess what we can create a user who will have restricted access.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.160
I mean,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.050
we can only let him view this particular view,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.220
but not the content is at the table.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.630
So let's make use off the user that were created in our previous video.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:12.750
So I'm going to click this table good properties security and delete this user from here

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.720
and out.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.910
Click Save and I go to views.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.560
Click properties go to security.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.000
New privileges to that user.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.850
For this view,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.950
new user privileges select and save.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.900
Well,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.010
that's all there is to it.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:40.030
So I would open this new shell new user they use.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.060
The name Password is going to be as DF think.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.310
I've entered the wrong password.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:55.450
Let's tryto reopen New user.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:06.180
Hey is DF Select Star from students.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.530
He tries to view the students table,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.610
but he can't.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.810
Permission is denied,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:22.550
but he says select star from my view and he can see the information that he needs.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.200
So that's the advantage off views.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.950
And if you go to my document,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.850
that's what is written here.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.150
Is there a couple of advantages that are associated with the view.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.050
This is something that I've just demonstrated,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.790
and it can have very complex query here.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.710
It doesn't necessarily have to deal with only single table he could use in a joint out of

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.300
joints,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.050
etcetera,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.360
and make it as complex as you wish.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.470
You can also create a view from PG admin as ville,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.480
for example.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.850
You just go here,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.830
create view,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:11.150
you would get some name and the definition is very your actual court will go.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:25.170
Let me just copy this code from here this statement and passed it over here and that's it.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.800
You can add the privileges if you wish.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.350
Click save.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.890
I'm going to say sell its star from his dear What's from the Cleary and it works.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.710
Views are actually used in real world as well.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.720
For example,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.070
if you have a sales team,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.210
maybe you wanted to expose some sales details to them while hiding some of descends to

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.700
information like user personal information like email I D or a phone number.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.820
So it's what,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.060
while talking about views.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.290
All right,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.450
see you in my next video
