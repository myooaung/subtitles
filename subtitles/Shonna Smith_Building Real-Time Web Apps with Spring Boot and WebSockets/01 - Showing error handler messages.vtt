00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] So, in an earlier exercise,

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.080
we showed how to update our controllers

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.060
to make sure that error handling could happen.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.020
So, I promised I would revisit

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.050
what has to happen on the client side

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.010
so let's get to that now.

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.090
We're gonna walk through the JavaScript code that's required

8
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.060
to handle errors and show them to the GUI

9
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.050
and we're also gonna have to force a server-side error

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.040
just so we can mimic what would happen when an error happen

11
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.050
and you can see that in action on the GUI

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.070
so let's get started.

13
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.080
First, in my source main resources,

14
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.010
I'm gonna open up my app.js file

15
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.070
and I'm going to maximize it

16
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.040
so we can see more of what's going on in the editor.

17
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.090
So, in the interest of time,

18
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.070
I've already started the code that's required

19
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070
to get error messages off of a topic.

20
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.090
It's just like all of the other code we've written,

21
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.050
except we now have to subscribe to an additional cue,

22
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.080
one that we've setup that's called topic/errors.

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.040
And I've already written a showErrors method

24
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.030
so let's scroll down and just take a look

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.030
to see what's going on there.

26
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.030
Much like our other show functions,

27
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.070
it's pretty much manipulating the HTML,

28
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.010
adding a table row which displays our message to the user.

29
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.000
So, in order to see this in action,

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
we're gonna have to force an error situation.

31
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.060
So, what I'm gonna do now is in my controller package,

32
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.010
open up my controller class,

33
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.070
maximize that a bit,

34
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.080
and just as a reminder,

35
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.060
our handleException method that we wrote earlier,

36
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.000
it's gonna send a ChatOutMessage

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.030
and because of the SendTo annotation,

38
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.000
those messages will go

39
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.070
to the topic/errors message destination.

40
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.010
The last thing we need to do is force an error

41
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.050
so I'm gonna go up in my method

42
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.080
that handles all of our chat messaging

43
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.080
and let's just force a null pointer exception here

44
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.000
by setting the message to null

45
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.040
and then just trying to call a getter on it.

46
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.050
That should be sufficient to force an error

47
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.050
just so we can see what this looks like on the GUI

48
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.000
so let's go ahead and run this real quick.

49
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.080
And once again,

50
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.050
I'm gonna bring up my two browser windows

51
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.070
to mimic two people chatting.

52
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.080
In one window, I'll join as Shonna.

53
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.060
In the other window, I'll join as Susan.

54
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.070
And I'm gonna try to message

55
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.040
and this should cause an error

56
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.020
once I send

57
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.060
and there you go,

58
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.090
on both clients.

59
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.010
For both Shonna and Susan's browser windows,

60
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.020
you see that our error message showed up,

61
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.030
An error happened.

62
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.030
I'm sure you'll take this and mature this

63
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.060
to do something more interesting.

64
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.020
So, that was a pretty simple example

65
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.030
of how error handling could happen,

66
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.060
but enough for you to get the point.

67
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.010
In any chat application,

68
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.080
you will have to anticipate errors

69
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.000
and now you have an example of how to handle them.
