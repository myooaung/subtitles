2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.090
to develop a real-time app?

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.060
If your answer is yes

4
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.050
and you're an experienced Enterprise Java developer,

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.000
you're in the right place.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.040
Hi, I'm Shonna Smith.

7
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.090
I've been an Enterprise Java developer since the late '90s

8
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.000
and have been using the Spring Framework

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.020
since the early 2000s when it first came out.

10
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.010
In this course, I'm gonna show you how

11
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.050
to use the Spring Framework and the WebSocket API

12
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.030
to make a chat app.

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.070
I'll walk you through how to create the chat client

14
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.000
as well as the chat server application code.
