- [Shonna] Well, that's our chat app, folks.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.060
Thank you for taking my course.

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.050
We just covered a lot of ground,

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.020
showing you how you can write a chat application,

5
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.050
both the client, using SockJS,

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.010
and the server, using the Spring Framework

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.040
and its support for the WebSocket API.

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.020
I hope you got something useful out of the exercises.

9
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.040
I also hope you take the time to challenge yourself

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.000
to extend the provided code

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.080
and achieve way more than I could cover

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.010
in this brief lesson.

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.000
You should note that the Spring community

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and the SockJS community both have forums

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.050
that you might want to follow so that you can ask questions

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.090
and get help on whatever next steps you choose to take.

17
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090
Feel free to reach out to me with comments

18
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.000
and to share your challenge results.

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.070
You can find me on LinkedIn at Shashonna Smith

20
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.090
and on Twitter @coderighter.

21
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.080
I want to encourage you to round out your Spring know-how

22
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.040
by taking my other courses in the library,

23
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.090
Spring: Test-Driven Development with JUnit

24
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.000
and Spring MVC, a deep dive.
