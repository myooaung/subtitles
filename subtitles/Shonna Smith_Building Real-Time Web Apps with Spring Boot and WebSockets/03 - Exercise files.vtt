- [Teacher] You'll have access to all of the exercise files

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.060
that I'll be covering in this course.

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.040
I want to show you quickly how everything is organized.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.010
By chapter, and by unit within the chapter,

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.010
you'll see a folder and a directory structure,

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.060
which includes complete projects

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.030
that are ready to be imported into your IDE.

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.050
All projects have a begin and end state,

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.000
so you can pick up from wherever you like.
