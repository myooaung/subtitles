00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.020
- [Instructor] Any app that gives a user

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.000
instant feedback soon after

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.010
or even while a user is interacting with the web browser

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.010
can be considered a real-time app.

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.070
Think of how chat apps,

6
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.000
they give a visual cue

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to indicate that a chat message recipient

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.050
is currently typing a response.

9
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.090
Creating apps like these could be useful for many reasons.

10
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.050
In this video, we'll talk about some popular reasons

11
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.000
why you would want to learn to create a real-time app

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.010
using the Spring framework.

13
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.030
I like to call this my top five reasons why

14
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.020
you should learn Spring real-time app development.

15
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.020
The first reason is staying on trend.

16
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.020
I'm sure you've noticed

17
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.060
that many recent websites and mobile apps

18
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.090
are designed to give users

19
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.060
the field of constant interactivity.

20
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.010
Think of apps like chat apps, collaboration platforms,

21
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.050
even social media platforms.

22
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.020
These are all examples of where real-time app features

23
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.000
are not only the trend but the expectation.

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.040
If you plan to build an app that is similar to these,

25
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.030
then you wanna be sure to learn what it takes

26
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.020
to create real-time apps.

27
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.070
Second is job readiness.

28
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.050
If you're joining the development team

29
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.040
that's working on a real-time app

30
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.070
or has a real-time app in its portfolio of apps to maintain,

31
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
you need to understand something about the major technology

32
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.070
and APIs involved in creating these kinds of apps.

33
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.040
Third, new challenges.

34
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.030
Maybe you've never created an app

35
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.010
that involved features with real-time web client

36
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.000
and web server interaction.

37
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Maybe you're ready to do some proactive preparation

38
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.050
for a future job opportunity.

39
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.090
Number four, ideal user experiences.

40
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.040
For certain types of apps,

41
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.080
especially chat apps and cloud-based collaboration apps,

42
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.060
it's not just a trend,

43
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.040
but a necessary part of an ideal user experience.

44
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.060
That puts this type of development know-how

45
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.090
in the required versus just nice to have category.

46
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.050
If you did a search for most popular apps in 2018,

47
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.000
you will see what most of them have in common

48
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.070
and that is providing real-time interactivity

49
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.090
and updates for their users.

50
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.030
And number five, Spring familiarity.

51
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.020
You could learn how to build real-time apps

52
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.040
in other frameworks,

53
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.090
but if you're already familiar with Enterprise Java

54
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.010
and Spring ecosystems including Spring Boot, Spring MVC,

55
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.010
and all the other Spring things,

56
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.030
then you might as well learn how to leverage that knowledge

57
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.050
for your first steps

58
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.000
in learning how to build real-time apps.
