00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.900
<v Instructor>This course is packed with content.</v>

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.940
We're almost done getting started

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.500
and thereafter we'll dive right into TypeScript

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.667
and into all it's exciting features

5
00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.850
and learn them step by step.

6
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.210
We'll start with the TypeScripts basics of course.

7
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.800
The core types, how it generally works,

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
some of the new features it adds,

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.930
and all you need to know to get a good

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.320
understanding of TypeScript.

11
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.690
Thereafter we'll already dive deeper

12
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.590
into the TypeScript compiler

13
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.310
and the configuration of it because it's super important

14
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.480
for you to understand what you can configure there

15
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.450
and what all these different settings do

16
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.120
so we'll have a closer look at that

17
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.840
in this module.

18
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.900
Thereafter we'll explore next generation JavaScript

19
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.850
features supported in TypeScript.

20
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.880
How they work and how you can use them in TypeScript.

21
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.500
We'll continue with classes and interfaces,

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.000
a super important concept partly also in vanilla

23
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.350
JavaScript in the case of classes,

24
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.510
but with interfaces we also got a brand new

25
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.600
TypeScript feature and you will understand

26
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.550
what they are, what they do,

27
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.210
and why we might want to use them.

28
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.190
Thereafter it's time to dive deeper.

29
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.490
We'll have a look at some advanced types

30
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.280
and advanced TypeScript features in general

31
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.040
taking it to the next level there

32
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.640
and building up on the basics

33
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.110
we already learned about up to this point.

34
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.630
Also an advanced feature, which definitely

35
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.210
deserves it's own section, is the generics feature.

36
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910
You will learn what that is

37
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.160
and why it's really, really helpful

38
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.650
in this module.

39
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.570
Followed by decorators.

40
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.360
Decorators are a pretty cool feature

41
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.550
also added by TypeScript and we'll have a closer look

42
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.810
at decorators and also build some really useful

43
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.200
decorators in that module

44
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.800
and thereafter we will have learned a lot

45
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.100
about TypeScript.

46
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.660
Now, the course is organized such that I show

47
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.460
all these individual features in relatively small

48
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.040
simple demos.

49
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.730
Now to also give you a bigger picture

50
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.640
and to see how you would apply all these features

51
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.140
in a real project, we'll build just that.

52
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.400
We'll have a whole module where we build

53
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.420
an entire project entirely with TypeScript

54
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.720
from scratch so that you see many of these features,

55
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.090
most of these features you learned about

56
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.920
up to this point, in action

57
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680
and you'll see how they work together

58
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.760
and why they simplify the process of building

59
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.160
such a project.

60
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.940
Once we're done building this project

61
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.770
we'll identify a new problem

62
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.420
and we'll learn how to solve it by working

63
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.450
with namespaces and modules

64
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.100
which will help us make our code

65
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.570
more manageable and readable.

66
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.600
Building up on that, we'll also explore

67
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.350
Webpack with TypeScript.

68
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.690
Webpack is a build tool we use in modern front end

69
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.530
web development and you can use it

70
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.970
combined with TypeScript to get a better project set up

71
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.520
which simply makes certain things easier

72
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.990
and allows you to get the best of bother worlds.

73
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.850
A great development experience

74
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.170
and also code that works really well

75
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.120
for your end users.

76
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.320
Once we're done with that we have a very solid

77
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.710
picture of TypeScript and how to work

78
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.180
with it in projects.

79
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.250
Now what you will need in a lot of real projects

80
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.183
are third party libraries

81
00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:16.820
so we will take a closer look

82
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.250
at that because there are certain third party libraries

83
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.280
which really embraced TypeScript

84
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.630
and have built in TypeScript support,

85
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.600
but there also are many libraries

86
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.030
which don't and we'll have a look at how we can work

87
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.320
with both types of libraries in a great way

88
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.520
in TypeScript projects.

89
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.630
Well and then there are some specific

90
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.620
scenarios which deserve their own modules.

91
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.570
We'll have a whole module about

92
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.320
React with TypeScript, how you can build

93
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.540
an entire React application with TypeScript only,

94
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.452
and also an entire module

95
00:03:49.452 --> 00:03:53.260
about NodeJS and express end type script

96
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.390
so that you also have great examples

97
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.910
for these very popular and specific use cases

98
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.270
of TypeScript where you can suddenly

99
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.630
create React or Node applications

100
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.760
in a brand new way with a brand new language.

101
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.260
So lots of exciting content in the course.

102
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.970
Let's not waste any time.

103
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.720
Let's see how you can get the most out

104
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.263
of the course and thereafter let's dive in.
