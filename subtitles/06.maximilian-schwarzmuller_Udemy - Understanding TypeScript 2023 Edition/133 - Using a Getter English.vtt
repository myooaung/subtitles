<v Instructor>To output more useful information</v>

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.400
about a single project item,

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.270
let's go to the ProjectItem class,

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.480
because that is where we render this.

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.670
And in there, when I set the content of the h3 tag,

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.300
which is that number of persons,

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.690
we could change this to, say, number of persons

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.047
which we're outputting here plus "assigned."

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.160
So that we at least say, if I render this, "5 assigned."

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.010
But "5 assigned" also isn't really a good wording, right?

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.230
Of course we could say five,

12
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440
or whatever the number is, "persons assigned."

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.390
So if we say "persons assigned" here, that is better...

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.520
Whoops, testing.

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.063
Does this work?

16
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.000
Because now this says "5 Persons assigned."

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.860
Well, that's better, but it's still not optimal.

18
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.740
What if we only have a project with one person?

19
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.610
It still says "persons,"

20
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.880
and that doesn't make too much sense.

21
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.430
Now, a getter can help us there.

22
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.120
So instead of saying "persons" or "person" here,

23
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.140
I just say plus "assigned."

24
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.650
But actually I don't just wanna output

25
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.090
the number of people here,

26
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.030
I wanna use a getter instead,

27
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.800
which returns us a proper term.

28
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.660
So, the right text basically.

29
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.033
So here I'll add a getter.

30
00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.860
Not a must do, but a convention you often see

31
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.580
is to add getters and setters right below your upper fields.

32
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.680
So I will add it here,

33
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.350
below my fields above the constructor.

34
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.480
Now I'll name it "persons."

35
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.440
The name is totally up to you.

36
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.840
I'll name it "persons" here.

37
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.630
And a getter is basically like a function.

38
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.260
So you have to add parenthesis here

39
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.150
and then curly braces.

40
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.400
Now in there, as you see, you must return a value.

41
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.184
And here I wanna return a value

42
00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:53.640
which is basically some text

43
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.723
based on the number of people I have in my project here.

44
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.090
So here we're gonna check if this.project.people

45
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.390
is equal to one.

46
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.390
In that case I will return "1 person" as a text here,

47
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.150
else I know it's more than one or zero

48
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.350
and in both cases I would say "persons," plural form.

49
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.720
I will return a template literal actually,

50
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.120
simply because it's easier to write text

51
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.610
with injected content with a template literal.

52
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.860
And there I'll say this.project.people "persons."

53
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.120
So now this is the text I'll return in this scenario.

54
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.060
So now we just have to use this getter

55
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.320
to automatically get the right jargon, the right text.

56
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.390
So down there,

57
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.840
instead of reaching out to this.project.people

58
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.700
I will just say, this.persons.assigned.

59
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.550
And I access this like a normal property,

60
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.560
so we're not calling this like a function with parenthesis,

61
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.740
instead we access this like this.

62
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.710
But this will trigger this getter

63
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.080
because it is the same name.

64
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.690
So this will trigger this getter,

65
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.390
run our logic there and then return the appropriate text.

66
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.180
So now if we try this again.

67
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.050
Testing.

68
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.390
Does this work?

69
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.460
And I assign five, we see "5 persons assigned."

70
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.820
Does this really work?

71
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.800
For sure?

72
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.150
And I add one here.

73
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.350
We see "1 person assigned."

74
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.480
So now this works in the way I want it to work.

75
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.840
Now this really outputs this properly

76
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.860
and it shows a nice use case of a getter.

77
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.840
Where this helps us transform data

78
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.043
when we retrieve it.
