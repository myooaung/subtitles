00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.740
<v Presenter>And this is it for this little demo project.</v>

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.590
Now, of course there is always more you could do,

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.070
but here we're already using a bunch of nice types

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.950
of features you learned about throughout this course.

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.220
And with this project, you hopefully have a better idea

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.610
of when you use which feature, why certain features

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.968
like decorators and interfaces exist, how they can help us,

8
00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:30.770
and how we can write type-safe, scalable code.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.735
Now, definitely feel free to build up on this project,

10
00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.826
add more features on your own,

11
00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:38.110
explore what you could change there,

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.870
and simply practice working with typescript.

13
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.344
I'm happy with the current state and in the next module,

14
00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.456
I now wanna tackle a quite obvious problem.

15
00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:51.150
We got one super huge file here.

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.030
So, splitting this up into multiple files would really help

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.953
us with managing our code base.

18
00:00:56.953 --> 00:01:00.090
Because, right now if we wanna change something somewhere,

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.710
we always have to scroll for the entire file

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.340
and find the place where we wanna make a change.

21
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.000
That's not ideal.

22
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.030
There's already quite a lot of code,

23
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.770
in even bigger projects it would be totally unmanageable.

24
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.780
So, in the next module we'll have a look

25
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.750
at the features types it gives us that help us

26
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.423
with splitting our code across multiple files.
