1
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.220
Now that we have a good understanding of

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.410
the basic typescript features and what typescript adds.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.070
And we also understand how the

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.320
typescript compiler works.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.760
Let's have a look at what else

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.020
typescript has to offer,

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.700
specifically when it comes to modern Javascript syntax.

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.130
Now, this is a difficult, pretty vague term,

9
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.360
but in the end what I mean by that,

10
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.380
are Javascript features which have been around

11
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.410
for a few years by now and which are

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.790
well supported in modern browsers,

13
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.290
but which don't necessarily run in all,

14
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.970
especially in older browsers

15
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.570
and there, especially in Internet Explorer.

16
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.210
I'm talking about things like Let, Cons,

17
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.240
arrow functions, de-structuring syntax,

18
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.350
spread operator, end so on.

19
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.220
So if that is something you absolutely know,

20
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.950
you can skip this module because it will also

21
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.230
refresh the knowledge on these topics,

22
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.240
but it will also explain what typescript

23
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.000
does with these things, with this syntax.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.450
Though, the short story is, typescript compiles it

25
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.980
such that it works.

26
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.510
Nonetheless we'll take a look at that,

27
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.940
but you can skip this module

28
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.290
if that's all stuff you already know.

29
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.130
You can just have a look at the curriculum

30
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.400
and see if there is any lecture in this module

31
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.260
which might still be interesting to you,

32
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.450
otherwise, I'll see you after this module.

33
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.140
If you're not sure about these features,

34
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.500
if you know Javascript, regarding

35
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.610
Var and Zon, but you don't know what the

36
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.810
Let or Cons keyword really means,

37
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.820
then you should stick with me and dive into this module.

38
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.860
For that I have a brand new project setup,

39
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.450
you'll find it attached.

40
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.780
And you always need to run NPM install first

41
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.613
in these projects.

42
00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.610
Don't forget this to install all dependencies

43
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.530
and thereafter always NPM start

44
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.390
to start up that development server.

45
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.480
Now, this is a project basically as we had it before

46
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.280
at the end of last module.

47
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.550
tsconfig file with a pretty strict configuration

48
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.210
An app.ts file here and this folder

49
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.740
will be generated automatically.

50
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.100
By the way, keep this development server running of course

51
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.360
as you did before,

52
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.610 line:15% 
and now we can always compile our code

53
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.300 line:15% 
with the TSC command here.

54
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.670 line:15% 
Or, and that's what I'll do here, TSC dash W

55
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.160 line:15% 
to enter watch mode and make sure we recompile

56
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.980
whenever we change something.

57
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.900
So now that's our project setup

58
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.030
and now we'll dive into some next-gen

59
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.790
Javascript features, which typescript it supports

60
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.390
and what you should be aware of.
