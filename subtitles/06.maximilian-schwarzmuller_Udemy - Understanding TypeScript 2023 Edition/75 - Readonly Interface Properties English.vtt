1
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Instructor>Now inside of an interface</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.310
you can also add the read-only modifier.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.780
You cannot add public or private or anything like that.

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.300
This is not possible on an interface,

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.610
but you can add read-only to make it clear

6
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.470
that this property in whatever object you built based

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
on this interface must only be set once

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.030
and is read-only thereafter so that it can't be changed

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.440
after the object has been initialized.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.893
This is also something, if we use a type instead,

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180
which you can use on a type if you want to though,

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.800
so again, these two things are very similar here,

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.510
but it's more common or seen more often

14
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.790
that if you really wanna work with an object,

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.730
you use an interface for that,

16
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.620
and read-only is just one other thing you can add there

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.400
as a extra feature you can set up.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.320
With read-only added here, by the way,

19
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.100
you see I didn't add it here in the class.

20
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.170
I didn't add read-only here

21
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.560
and still if I now go to user one

22
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.460
and then try to set name to something else,

23
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.740
I get an error here already

24
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.120
because it's read-only

25
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.210
and of course I also get that if I save it

26
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.140
and it tries to compile that,

27
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.640
so the interface is really having an effect here

28
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.880
once we implement it into our class

29
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910
even though I didn't add read-only here,

30
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.650
the class knows that it implements readable

31
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.310
and it automatically assumes that the property name,

32
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.170
which we have here, which we need to have

33
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.430
because of the interface, is read-only

34
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.500
because that is what we set up inside of the interface,

35
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.973
and that's of course pretty convenient as well.
