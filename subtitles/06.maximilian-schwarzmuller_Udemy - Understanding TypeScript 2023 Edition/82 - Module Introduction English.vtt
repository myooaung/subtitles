00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.360
<v Instructor>With a lot of the basics out of the way,</v>

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.730
let's explore some advanced typing concepts now,

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.800
some advanced concepts typescript offers to you

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.640
that can become handy in certain situations

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.140
you might be facing in the projects you're working on.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.210
In this module, we'll have a look at a couple

7
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.250
of interesting concepts, among them intersection types,

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.820
what that is and why it mighty be useful,

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.670
type guards, what we can do with those,

10
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.410
discriminated unions, fancy term

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.430
for a quite interesting topic.

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.810
We'll also have a look at type casting,

13
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.450
a useful feature for telling typescripts

14
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.050
about the type of something in cases

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.140
where typescript is not able to find out

16
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.860
which type something has on its own,

17
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.550
and we'll have a look at function overloads,

18
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.330
a pretty neat feature that allows us

19
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.480
to write more flexible functions with better types

20
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.083
of support than we might otherwise get it.
