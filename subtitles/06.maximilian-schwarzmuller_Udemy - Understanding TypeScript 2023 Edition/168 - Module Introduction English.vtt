00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Instructor>Now in the last module we learned</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.420
how to work with third party libraries in TypeScript,

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.680
and that's exactly what we'll build up on in this module.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.470
We will build a tiny application, a very simple website

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.680
where we will use third party libraries to send

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.900
HTTP requests and also to render a map

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.670
with the help of Google Maps.

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.630
So that is what we'll do and of course we'll do

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.313
all of this with TypeScript.
