1
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.610
<v Instructor>And this is it for this module.</v>

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.210
We had a look at some advanced TypeScript features

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.000
that can some in handy in applications,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and like with all the other concepts

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.720
you already learned about, of course,

6
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.500
we will have a project where we see many of these things

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.530
in action so that you don't just learn them here in theory,

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.610
but you also see them applied in a real project.

9
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.870
Nonetheless, I hope the concepts taught here

10
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.250
are pretty clear and their use is clear, as well,

11
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.830
and why you might want to use some of these patterns

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.010
because features like intersection types,

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.010
function overloads, type guards in various variations

14
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.440
with different approaches to find out

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.280
which type something has,

16
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.440
the discriminated unions pattern, and so on.

17
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.630
These are all interesting patterns

18
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.800
that can help you improve your code, your code quality

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.010
and make your intentions clearer.

20
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.090
Type casting can be super important

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.980
to get proper types of support

22
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.020
and make sure that you can really work with TypeScript

23
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.290
in the best possible way

24
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.960
and get the best possible type checking.

25
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.310
And with that, let's move on to other modules

26
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.030
and see what else Typescript has in store for us.

27
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.010
As I mentioned, we'll, of course, also see many

28
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.910
of these concepts being applied in a real project

29
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.013
and in general throughout this course.
