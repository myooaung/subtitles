<v Instructor>SourceMap helps us with</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.560
debugging and development.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.540
So to show what this does let me compile everything

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.000
without that sourceMap setting.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.530
If we now go to the browser and we want to understand

6
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.420
what our code does, we can go to the sources tab here

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.620
in developer tools and there we find our JavaScript files.

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.060
Now we can dive into these files

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.090
and the good thing is these files

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.350
are fairly readable to us, humans of course

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.940
because they contain JavaScript code in the end.

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.200
Now that's good but what if we had more complex

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.940
TypeScript code and we want to debug our TypeScript code

14
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.640
and not the compiled JavaScript code.

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.060
In other words it would be nice if we would

16
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.180
see the TypeScript files here and not the JavaScript files.

17
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.000
With the sourceMap option you can get there.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.700
If you set this to true and you run the tsc command again

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.950
then you see we got these .js, .map files being

20
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.810
generated as well.

21
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.540
Now if we look at them they're pretty strange files

22
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.920
but what they do is they basically act as a bridge

23
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.110
which is understood by modern browsers

24
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.170
and the developer tools there to connect

25
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.410
the JavaScript files to the input files.

26
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.440
So with these files generated if I reload here

27
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.320
you see in the sources tab we now not just have our

28
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.497
JavaScript files we also see our TypeScript files there.

29
00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:27.230
And we can even place break points in the TypeScript files

30
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.320
and if I now click on the button for example

31
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.650
it now pauses in the TypeScript file.

32
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.720
Which is of course super, super convenient.

33
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.670
Because that really takes our debugging process

34
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.260
to the next level because we can work directly

35
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.400
in our input files basically, in our TypeScript files

36
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.670
instead of the JavaScript files.

37
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.010
Now nonetheless here I'll comment this out because

38
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.800
we have a fairly simple project here and I don't want

39
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.580
to have these extra .map files lie around here.

40
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.950
But this is super useful in projects

41
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.803
because it simplifies debugging.
