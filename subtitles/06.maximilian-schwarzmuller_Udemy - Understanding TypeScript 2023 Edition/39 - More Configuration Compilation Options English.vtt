<v Instructor>Now, all the interesting is</v>

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.320
allowJs.

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.590
With allowJs and by the way all the way we have

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.060
checkJs you can always include JavaScript

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.620
files in the compilation.

6
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.747
Now with allowJs a JavaScript file will be

7
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.470
compiled by type script so even if doesn't end

8
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.813
with .ts, type script will compile it

9
00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:22.266
with checkJs it will not compile it but it

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.107
will still check the syntax in there and

11
00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.079
report potentially errors.

12
00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.212
This could be nice if you don't really wanna use

13
00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:29.934
type script but you wanna take advantage

14
00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.095
of some of its features and as far as

15
00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:37.060
type script can help you with the any type only

16
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.487
which is effectively what you have in

17
00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:41.385
JavaScript it will do so if you enable

18
00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:42.540
these options.

19
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.170
Now we don't need it for this project

20
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.316
and for this project we would want to

21
00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:48.745
make sure we don't double compile these

22
00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:50.833
JavaScript files which do stem from

23
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.004
type script files so we would have to tweak

24
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.782
the include and exclude settings a bit

25
00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:57.218
but you could use that in projects where you don't

26
00:00:57.218 --> 00:01:00.830
wanna use type script at all or where for whatever

27
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.037
reason you have some vanilla JavaScript files

28
00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:06.263
next to your type script files and you wanna

29
00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:09.393
check the vanilla JavaScript files as well.

30
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.923
Now let's fast forward a bit, jsx is an option

31
00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:17.050
that can help you with react js which does not really

32
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.250
matter for us here, declaration and declarationMap

33
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.550
is also not important here.

34
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.830
Dts files are an advanced concept which matter

35
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.022
to you if you're shipping your project as a

36
00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:30.044
library to other people and you need basically

37
00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:32.287
a manifest file which describes all the

38
00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:34.537
types you have in your project, that's such

39
00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:36.022
a .d.ts file.

40
00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:39.403
Source map is an interesting one though.
