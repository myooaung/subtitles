<v Instructor>Now, besides these</v>

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.770
different import and export syntaxes,

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.160
which are good to know, there is one other thing

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.583
which you have to understand and know.

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.900
In project state, we're not just exporting a class

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.690
or an interface, as we're doing it in all the other files,

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.810
but we're actually exporting a constant project state.

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.710
Now, the thing is, we're importing this constant

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.660
in multiple other files.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.930
We're importing it in the project-list.ts file,

11
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.480
we're also importing it in the project-input.ts file.

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.490
So we import from the same file multiple times.

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.560
The question is does this code in this file,

14
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.600
namely the creation of this constant here,

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.920
does this run once or twice or how often does it run?

16
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.240
Once per import statement or once for the entire app?

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.980
Well, turns out it runs once when the file is imported

18
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.000
for the first time by any other file.

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.280
If another file then imports that same file again,

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.320
it does not run again.

21
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.970
We can also validate this by adding

22
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210
a console log statement here.

23
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.370
Running.

24
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.893
We'll see this only will get printed once

25
00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:20.190
even though we're importing project-state.ts both here

26
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.360
in the project-list.ts file

27
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.620
and in the project-input.ts file.

28
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.740
Still, this will only be printed to the console once.

29
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.610
You see it here.

30
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.443
Running.

31
00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:31.350
It will never be printed a second time,

32
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.653
no matter what we do.

33
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.360
So this only runs once.

34
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.620
This is how it behaves and this is just something you have

35
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.723
to know so that you can plan your app appropriately.
