<v Instructor>In modern web development,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.910
we typically also work with third party libraries.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.330
We don't write all the code of our projects on our own.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.760
Instead, typically we utilize third party libraries

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.510
so that we don't always have to reinvent the wheel

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.980
on our own but can add certain functionalities

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.510
to our projects and then just focus

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.610
on our core business logic.

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.660
Now, in this module, we will have a look

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.180
at third party libraries and how you can add them

11
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.750
to your TypeScript project,

12
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.520
and specifically, we'll have a look at two types

13
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.250
of libraries and what working with them

14
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.620
in a TypeScript project means.

15
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.100
We'll have a look at normal libraries,

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.400
which you could use in regular JavaScript projects, as well,

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.780
and you will learn how you can use them

18
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.470
in TypeScript and get the most out of them,

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.430
but then we will also have a look

20
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.890
at some TypeScript specific libraries.

21
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.960
The difference will be that these are libraries

22
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.560
that really utilize and embrace certain types of features

23
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.120
to give you a brand new way of working with them

24
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.700
to give you certain functionalities

25
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.040
you can't build like this with vanilla JavaScript.

26
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.523
So let's have a look at both in this module.
