00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.270
<v ->So in this module,</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.310
we had a look at react and TypeScript.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.991
And as you see TypeScript here again,

4
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.300
can add a lot of nice extra features and checks,

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.020
that make sure that we write clear and error free code.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.240
Now, I did show you a couple of

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.290
very important patterns there,

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.750
and a couple of very important React features

9
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.350
like Props and State, and how to use them with TypeScript.

10
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.150
I also showed you how you should think about

11
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.450
adding our functionalities like Redux,

12
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.520
which we didn't use in this module.

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.810
And as I also mentioned,

14
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.520
at the end of the last lecture,

15
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.610
don't forget about all the other things

16
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.150
you learned about in this course.

17
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.920
All the types you learned about,

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.060
and all the things you can do with TypeScript.

19
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.640
Including the configuration here.

20
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.370
Everything you learned applies to this React,

21
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.600
plus TypeScript project as well.

22
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.960
Just because we had a nice configuration,

23
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.770
out of the box here, does not mean that you can't tweak it.

24
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.170
You can tweak it, and you can use everything

25
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.500
you learned in this course here in this project.

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.870
Because after all, even though

27
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.430
we're writing some React-ish code,

28
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.790
and we can use JSX, we're still writing JavaScript

29
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.960
or specifically TypeScript code.

30
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.510
And therefore everything you learn throughout course,

31
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.310
is valid here as well.

32
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880
It's easy to forget that, so always keep it in mind.

33
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.030
And with that, consider creating

34
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.560
your next React project with TypeScript.

35
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.083
You now certainly know, how to get started and how it works.
