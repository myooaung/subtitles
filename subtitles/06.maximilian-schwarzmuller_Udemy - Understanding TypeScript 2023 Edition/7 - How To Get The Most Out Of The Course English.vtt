00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.010
<v Instructor>Your success matters to me</v>

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.080
and I want to ensure

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.600
that you get the most out of this course.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.680
Now, of course, that starts with watching the videos.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.700
This is a Video On Demand course,

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.600
so of course, watch the videos.

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.270
You can go through this course step-by-step.

8
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.130
It's built in such way that all the modules

9
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.930
and lectures build up on each other.

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.210
You can also skip certain modules of course,

11
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.990
because all the modules also work on their own.

12
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.600
If you already know a concept, for example.

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.860
Now when watching the videos,

14
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.970
of course do that at your speed.

15
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.030
You got speed controls here in the video player

16
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.630
and you can slow me down if I'm going too fast

17
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.990
or speed me up if I'm going too slow for your taste.

18
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.400
I also recommend that you code along.

19
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.310
It's not a must do,

20
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.750
but you typically learn better

21
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.740
if you write code on your own

22
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.080
and you have to find and fix your own mistakes.

23
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.050
Also, pause and rewind the videos for that,

24
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.470
because the videos are, of course,

25
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.940
recorded in a way that also makes sense

26
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.140
to people who are not coding along.

27
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.088
So if you do, you might need to pause occasionally,

28
00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:08.420
try out the next steps on your own,

29
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.020
or go back to an earlier point in the video

30
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.200
to see how exactly I implemented something there.

31
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.430
And in general, practicing is important.

32
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.860
In this course, we work on real projects

33
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.810
and we have many smaller demos.

34
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.530
And it can only encourage you

35
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.139
that you sometimes pause

36
00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:27.660
and try out the next steps on your own,

37
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.890
or that you deviate from what I do

38
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.720
and try out your own things.

39
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.100
So definitely all the advance on your own.

40
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.200
Of course, only to a certain extent,

41
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.370
because if you have learned about a certain feature,

42
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.910
it might be hard to implement it on your own,

43
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.100
but whenever possible,

44
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.227
whenever you feel like it,

45
00:01:43.227 --> 00:01:46.113
definitely try out things on your own.

46
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.450
Now when you do that,

47
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.700
or when you just code along as well,

48
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.350
you will also face some errors.

49
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.340
Things don't always go as planned,

50
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.650
you introduce the mistake in your code,

51
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.230
and you get an error.

52
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.040
Now debug these errors and search on your own.

53
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.300
Use the attached code, which you'll find attached

54
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.120
to many lectures in the course,

55
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.580
always to the last lecture of each module,

56
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.900
so that you can compare your code to mine

57
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.860
and find out where it deviates.

58
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.220
But also, if you get error messages,

59
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.520
Google them or use the search (mumbles)

60
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.730
to also search the Q&amp;A section,

61
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.934
because chances are, someone else had a similar error

62
00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:27.770
and you can quickly fix it by looking at their solution.

63
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.450
Now of course, if you're really stuck

64
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.520
or if some concept is unclear,

65
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.200
you can also ask, but also answer here in the Q&amp;A section.

66
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.291
I do my best to provide quick support there,

67
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:42.090
but also try to help others there on your own.

68
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.820
Because beside fixing your own errors,

69
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.640
if you also help others and work with other students,

70
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.290
you get a lot out of this course as well.

71
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.170
So that's definitely all the recommendation I have.

72
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.220
And with all these steps,

73
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.240
or all these building blocks,

74
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.616
you have everything you need

75
00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:02.220
to get the most out of this course.

76
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.380
Now in the next lecture,

77
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.580
I will show you the setup, D.I.D.E,

78
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.190
I will be using throughout this course

79
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.003
and thereafter, we can already dive into type script.
