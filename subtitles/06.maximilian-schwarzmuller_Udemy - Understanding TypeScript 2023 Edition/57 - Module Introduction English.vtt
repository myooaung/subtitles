00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.940
<v Narrator>In this module, let's dive</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.100
into classes and interfaces.

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.900
Now, the concept of classes might not totally be new to you.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.420
Classes also exist in vanilla JavaScript,

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.100
in modern vanilla JavaScript at least.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.020
But if you haven't really worked with modern JavaScript,

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.510
then you might not know classes.

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.540
Or if you're relatively new to JavaScript,

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.600
you might also not know about them yet.

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.008
So I'll introduce you to classes

11
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.130
in this module as well.

12
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.890
And entirely new, in JavaScript world at least,

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.490
are interfaces.

14
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.610
So in this module, we'll explore what these things are

15
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.810
and why we use them and we'll have a detailed look

16
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.291
at classes and there also the concept called inheritance.

17
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:48.000
And at interfaces, what they bring to the table,

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.560
how they're compiled to JavaScript,

19
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.703
and why we might use these features.
