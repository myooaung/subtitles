1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.430
<v ->TypeScript is amazing,</v>

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.350
but in order to work with it efficiently,

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.960
I strongly recommend that you all have a powerful

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.910
code editor, a powerful IDE.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.940
And here, my clear recommendation is Visual Studio Code.

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.110
It's free to use,

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.180
and it has amazing types of support built in.

8
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.960
Now, you still need to install the types of compiler,

9
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.530
and we already did this.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.400
But this has the built in support,

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.030
which shows you a lot of errors directly in the IDE,

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.770
before you've even compiled the project.

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.750
So, you can simply visit code.visualstudio.com,

14
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.930
and there, you can download it for any operating system,

15
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.810
and simply walk through the installer there

16
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.260
to get this modern IDE.

17
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410
Now, this is the IDE I will be using

18
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.480
throughout this course.

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.340
And you can fine tune and configure it

20
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.410
to your requirements and needs.

21
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.910
Here are just some settings I'm using.

22
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.710
Under code references, you can change the color theme,

23
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
and there, I am using the Dark+ theme.

24
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.470
So, if you want the exact same look,

25
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.830
that's the theme I'm using.

26
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.150
But, of course, you can also play around

27
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.513
with any other theme here.

28
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.520
I've also installed certain extensions.

29
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.500
So, third party plugins, so to say,

30
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.330
which change the appearance or behavior of the editor.

31
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880
You can click on view,

32
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.660
and then extensions to be taken to the extensions menu

33
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.830
or the marketplace.

34
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.540
And it's all free, no worries,

35
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.540
nothing here costs you money.

36
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.060
Now, I've got tons of extensions installed,

37
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.750
but the extensions I would recommend

38
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.820
that you definitely have a look at is

39
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.690
ESLint, that you install this to get linting,

40
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.640
to get code quality check support in your projects.

41
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.060
And that you install the Material Icon Theme,

42
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.600
if you like these file icons I have in my project.

43
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.700
That's a pure visual thing, of course,

44
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.450
it doesn't change any behaviors.

45
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.230
And I can also recommend Path Intellisense,

46
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.480
so that later in the course, once we work with imports,

47
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.233
you get better support there.

48
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.250
And Prettier, which helps you format your code,

49
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.650
so that it always looks nice and is readable.

50
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.040
Prettier works together with a certain shortcut,

51
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.280
which you should be aware of.

52
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.800
Under preferences, keyboard shortcuts.

53
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000
There, if you search for format document,

54
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.930
this shortcut here is a shortcut you can always press

55
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.835
in your code to auto-format it,

56
00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:22.779
to add missing semi-colons,

57
00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.926
to make sure you used the right indentation everywhere,

58
00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:27.220
things like that.

59
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.950
It makes your code more readable,

60
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.340
and your life as a developer easier.

61
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.200
And that's it.

62
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.835
You can all install TSLint,

63
00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:37.200
but that will be merged with ESLint in the future,

64
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.030
so, ESLint should be all you really need.

65
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750
With that, we can go back to view, explorer,

66
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.460
and you should have the same settings I have here.

67
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.371
But also, dive into the settings in general,

68
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:51.940
and explore them, and fine tune everything

69
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.810
to your needs and to your likings.

70
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.200
And with that, you have a great editor,

71
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.540
which allows you to write great code, powerful code,

72
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.840
with a lot of built in types of support,

73
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.840
and you're well prepared to get the most out of this course.
