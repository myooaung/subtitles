1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.150
<v Instructor>And that's it for this module.</v>

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.040
We had a very detailed look at the TypeScript compiler,

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.140
how you can configure it,

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.360
and how you can make sure that it really compiles

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.800
your code the way you want.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.190
We had a look at all these different options,

7
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.030
especially the strict options,

8
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.610
really allow you to write correct code

9
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.850
and not run into strange bugs,

10
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.100
strange runtime bugs you might face,

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.610
for example, with the strict null checks,

12
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.660
and in addition to that,

13
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.960
we had a look at debugging,

14
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.390
how you can easily configure Chrome

15
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.250
and VS Code such that you can debug

16
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.830
from inside VS Code.

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.480
Debugging from inside Chrome with source maps

18
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.900
and the Sources tab, of course,

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.390
is always an option.

20
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.850
The key here also are the source maps,

21
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.710
which you are configuring to be generated

22
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.350
in the tsconfig file,

23
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.900
which are these map files

24
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.210
that live next to your JavaScript files.

25
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.600
They basically act as bridges for the debugger

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.300
between your JavaScript files

27
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.820
and your TypeScript files.

28
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.160
And with that, we know a bit more

29
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.680
regarding how to manage our projects.

30
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.870
Let's now see what else

31
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.173
we can do with TypeScript and JavaScript.
