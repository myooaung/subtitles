WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.070
<v ->At the moment I'm not using the webpack-dev server.</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.680
Now using it is very straight forward, though.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.030
We just have to the package.json file

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.430
and now there instead of "lite-server"

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.380
let's use "webpack-dev-server", like this.

6
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.020
And now let's start npm start again.

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.560
Now what you'll see is

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.610
that this now spins up a server running

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.780
on local host 8080,

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.330
and it spins up the webpack build work flow.

11
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.060
So now if you visit local host 8080

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.020
we see our project there.

13
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.860
The interesting thing now is

14
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.510
if we change something in code,

15
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.520
for example, if you adjust ERA console log here,

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.200
And it is saved and then you watch the bottom here,

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.160
you see it recompiles.

18
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.450
However, if you reload you don't see the log here

19
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.860
And also in the sources tab,

20
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.130
in the webpack source tab,

21
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.920
if you go to app.ts, you don't see the log here.

22
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.820
So it actually did not load the correct code.

23
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.790
This becomes clearer if I delete this bundle.js file here.

24
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.513
If I now restart this npm start process,

25
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.750
you will see it still works, and by the way,

26
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.090
don't wonder that the dist folder stays empty now,

27
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.240
in the webpack-dev server mode

28
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.020
the bundle is generated in memory only,

29
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.840
so it is there and it is loaded by the dev server,

30
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.490
but it's not actually written to the dist.

31
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.270
But you'll see that if you reload,

32
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.180
this page now also crashes.

33
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.050
Now, I said the file would be there,

34
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.080
but it doesn't seem like it's there, right?

35
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.120
Now it's missing on the dist as I said,

36
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.120
and of course we are importing from dist/bundle.js

37
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.130
and index.html, but indeed you can believe me

38
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.810
it is generated in memory.

39
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450
The problem just is

40
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.640
things are not wired up correctly at the moment.

41
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.330
To tweak this we have to go to the webpack.config.js file

42
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
and there, in output, actually add a publicPath key

43
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.647
and set this to "dist."

44
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.120
If you now save this and restart,

45
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.670
now you see it reloads

46
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.400
and now you see "Hi" here.

47
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.320
In the sources tab you now also see

48
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.580
that correct output there.

49
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.860
If you go to the dot folder,

50
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.270
source app.ts you see the console log statement.

51
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.893
And if I now go to app.ts and delete that,

52
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.460
it rebuilds and now the console log statement is gone there.

53
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.410
This is just an additional configuration

54
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.970
that is needed for the webpack-dev server

55
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.520
to really understand where the output is written to

56
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.910
and where it is relative to the index.html file.

57
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.180
Because by default the webpack-dev server

58
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.030
serves an index.html file,

59
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.550
it finds in the same folder as you run this script here.

60
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.520
Which is correct, but then it doesn't make the connection

61
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.030
to the dist folder correctly,

62
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.970
which is why we have to inform webpack-dev server

63
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.040
with publicPath where to find our assests,

64
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.960
so our bundle.js file in this case.

65
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.370
Now if we quit the development server

66
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.790
there is one other setting

67
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.080
I wanna apply here in development mode.

68
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.180
And I'll do this right at the top of the exported object.

69
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.800
I'll set mode to "development."

70
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.550
This will in the end tell webpack

71
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.590
that here we're building for development

72
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.450
and that it will do fewer optimizations

73
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.420
to improve our development experience,

74
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.950
make debugging even easier,

75
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.420
and give us more meaningful error messages, for example.

76
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.840
So in development we also

77
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.110
definitely wanna add this key here.

78
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.880
And with that and the webpack-dev server configured,

79
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.570
we now get the finished development work flow.

80
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.100
Now for production,

81
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.980
we'll need to adjust this work flow a bit

82
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.253
because there we want a different output.
