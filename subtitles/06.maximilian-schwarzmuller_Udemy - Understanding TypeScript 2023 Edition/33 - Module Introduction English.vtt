<v Instructor>In this module,</v>

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.910
we'll take a closer look at the TypeScript Compiler.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.070
Thus far, we always just used it

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.600
by running tsc and then pointing at a file

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.240
which we wanna compile.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.410
Now, whilst that, of course, works,

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.330
it's not really feasible for bigger projects

8
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.520
where you have multiple files

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.680
or where you simply don't want to run this command

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.660
after every change you wanna see in practice.

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.040
In addition to that convenience,

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.760
which we currently don't have,

13
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.890
there also are a couple of interesting things

14
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.250
you can configure regarding the compilation process

15
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.850
which actually change what is compiled

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.390
and how it is compiled.

17
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.730
And these are therefore the things

18
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.083
we'll take a closer look at in this module.
