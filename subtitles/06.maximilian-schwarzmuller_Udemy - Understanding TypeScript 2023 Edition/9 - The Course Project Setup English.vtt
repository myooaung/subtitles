1
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Male Instructor>So we set up the IDE,</v>

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.860
which is important.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.780
Now let's also set up a starting project,

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.370
which we'll use throughout this course

5
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.250
in the different course modules.

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.230
So basically, a project setup

7
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.110
with which we can start every course module

8
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.339
to then write our code there.

9
00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.730
Now as you will see throughout this course,

10
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.330
writing code doesn't require a complex setup in general.

11
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.330
But here, I want a project where we can write code,

12
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.490
compile it, and then immediately see the output

13
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.530
of that code in the browser.

14
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.970
And for that, I'll first of all add a new index HTML file.

15
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.520
And you can add this in any empty folder,

16
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.620
the two other files or folders you see here

17
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.530
are just config files for git,

18
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.460
in case you are using version control

19
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.200
and for my editor, which sets the zoom level.

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.670
So that's all I have here.

21
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.930
But in that index HTML file, I will now initialize it

22
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750
with a base skeleton.

23
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.390
And for that individuals to do code,

24
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.770
you can just type HTML, choose that html:5 option,

25
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.200
if you're not getting this menu,

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.820
just press control and space.

27
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.600
Choose the html:5 option, and hit enter,

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.740
and you'll get this skeleton.

29
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.670
There we could enter understanding TypeScript here

30
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.722
as a title, but that does not matter too much.

31
00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:21.150
More important is that here you add a script tag

32
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.000
in your head section and add a source and point

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.020
at app.js here and add the defer attribute.

34
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.270
This tries to import a app.js file,

35
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.520
which of course right now doesn't exist.

36
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.530
And it will then, of course,

37
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.960
also execute it, if it finds it.

38
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.210
This allows us to view our changes,

39
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.790
our code changes, directly on the screen in the browser.

40
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.410
Or if we're just logging something to the console,

41
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.560
in the browser def tools.

42
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.250
Next, I will add a app.ts file.

43
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.170
That's the file, a TypeScript file,

44
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.530
where will write some code.

45
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.580
And there, for example, you could console log

46
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.580
your code goes here, or whatever you want.

47
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.780
You can console log whatever you want here.

48
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.870
And if you do that, you can compile this file

49
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.280
with TypeScript, which we installed earlier,

50
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.880
for that you can open the terminal,

51
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.070
integrate it into the editor here.

52
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.580
And simply write tsc app.ts.

53
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.490
This compiles this TypeScript file

54
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.610
and generates an app.js file now,

55
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.530
which is the file we're importing here.

56
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.160
And if you now open this index.html file,

57
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.120
you see whatever happens in here.

58
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.800
You kick off the logic you wrote in here.

59
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.340
And either that's logic that manipulates something

60
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.410
on the dom, or like in this case,

61
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.870
it's logic which simply gets locked to the console.

62
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.700
So here in this case I opened this HTML file in the browser.

63
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.460
You can simply double click on it outside of the IDE.

64
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.960
So in the normal Windows Explorer, or the Mac Finder.

65
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.910
And then maybe open your developer tools

66
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.830
if you're just logging something to the console,

67
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.010
and you'll see your log here.

68
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.690
Now that's nice, but whenever we change something here

69
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.470
in our code, we have to manually recompile,

70
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.340
well that is what it is for now.

71
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.300
It will change later in the course.

72
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.970
But we also have to manually reload this page here.

73
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.140
And to speed this up and make sure

74
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.940
that you don't have to do this

75
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.900
whenever you change something,

76
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.540
we'll actually also add another tool here

77
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.890
to this dummy setup,

78
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.500
which we'll use throughout this course,

79
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.360
so that this happens automatically.

80
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.720
Now to install such a tool,

81
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.430
let's run npm init here.

82
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.830
In this project folder, the npm command is available

83
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.113
if you installed node JS.

84
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.050
Make sure that for that, you visit nodejs.org

85
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.690
and download and install the latest version you find here.

86
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.040
For the moment, we're not going to write any node JS code,

87
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.960
but node JS comes together with the NPM tool,

88
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.610
which you can use to install third party dependencies

89
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.210
or useful tools that speed up our development.

90
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.840
And for that reason, we need it here.

91
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.970
So with that installed, you can run npm init

92
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.800
in this project folder.

93
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.740
Simply hit enter,

94
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.560
and you can answer all these questions here

95
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.570
with the defaults by simply hitting enter all the time.

96
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.780
And once this completes, it gives you a package.json file

97
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.150
which looks something like this.

98
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.500
And now you can run npm install to install a dependency

99
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.410
which is exclusive to this project.

100
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.210
So to install a tool, you could say,

101
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.730
which you could use in this project,

102
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.520
<v ->-save-dev to mark it as a development only dependency,</v>

103
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.580
so a tool that helps us during development

104
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.610
and does not contain any code,

105
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.930
which will execute as part of our main code.

106
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.470
And the tool name is lite-server.

107
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.103
If you hit enter here, this installs this extra tool.

108
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.000
And once this finishes, just go into your package.json file

109
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.390
and in the scripts part, add a comma,

110
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.870
and add a new script which you'll name start.

111
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.029
And then as a value between double quotes,

112
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.570
enter lite-server.

113
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.580
So that name of the package which was added here.

114
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.550
If you now hit enter, you can run npm start here

115
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.400
to start this start script.

116
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.530
And lite server is a simple development server,

117
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.430
which always serves the index.html file

118
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.410
next to the page.json file, so this file.

119
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.410
And it serves your application on this URL you see here,

120
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.143
localhost:3000 by default.

121
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.690
And you can then just visit this location.

122
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.090
Simply enter localhost:3000 in the browser.

123
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.860
And now your code runs here.

124
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.170
And why is this better?

125
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.840
Well, this will now automatically reload the page

126
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.180
whenever another file in this directory changes.

127
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.130
So if I, for example, add a exclamation mark here,

128
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.180
and I save this, and I then compile this again

129
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.323
with tsc app.TS,

130
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.580
and you go back to the browser,

131
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.340
you see the latest output immediately,

132
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.230
because it automatically reloaded.

133
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.620
And that simply saves us the extra work

134
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.690
of reloading manually.

135
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.540
Now important about this npm start process,

136
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.450
definitely keep it running as long as you are working

137
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.210
on your project, as long as you are writing code

138
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.800
which you want to see executed in the browser.

139
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.633
Once you're done,

140
00:06:03.633 --> 00:06:06.450
you can always quit this process with control C,

141
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.200
but once you do so, your project

142
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.600
is no longer getting served under local host 3000.

143
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.980
So keep it up and running as long as you are writing code

144
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.650
and making changes.

145
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.510
With that, I'll change it back,

146
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.200
but this is totally up to you.

147
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.480
And this is the project setup I will use

148
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.410
throughout this course.

149
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.200
You'll also find it attached, of course,

150
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.530
in the finished form.

151
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.250
Just one important note.

152
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.330
If you download the attached starting project,

153
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.500
or any other course snapshot,

154
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.900
any other code snapshot you find anywhere in the course,

155
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.920
then you will get a download that does not include

156
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.070
this node modules folder.

157
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.590
This is a huge folder,

158
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.250
which in the end stores all third party packages

159
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.970
and their dependencies.

160
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.840
And since it is so huge, I typically delete it,

161
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.260
because you can easily recreate it

162
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.080
by running npm install.

163
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.640
So if you download one of my attachments,

164
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.010
navigate into the extracted folder,

165
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.530
and in that folder, run npm install.

166
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.341
And this will install all dependencies

167
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:06.110
and recreate this node modules folder.

168
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.280
And once you did this,

169
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.610
you can run npm start

170
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.330
or do whatever you wanna do in this project.

171
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.360
And with that, we've got this project setup

172
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.750
we'll use throughout the course.

173
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.810
Now let's not waste any more time,

174
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.303
and let's just get started.
