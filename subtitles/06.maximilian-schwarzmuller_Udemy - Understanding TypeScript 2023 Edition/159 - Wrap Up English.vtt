WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Instructor>So we added webpack, a very important tool</v>

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.070
that allows us to bundle together our different files

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.690
into one bundle.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.090
This really helps us decrease the amount

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.500
of HTTP requests made and, therefore,

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
can speed up our application.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.840
If you find yourself working with a lot of individual files,

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.270
which you typically do in bigger projects,

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.360
tools like webpack are a must-use

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.910
and webpack is the most important and prominent tool

11
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.200
that helps you with that

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.190
so, therefore, it's the tool I wanted to show here.

13
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.730
You see that webpack is highly configurable

14
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.190
and as I mentioned multiple times, the official docs

15
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.630
of webpack are the place to go to learn all about it.

16
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.120
About different loaders, different error settings

17
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.770
you can set up and how it works, in general.

18
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.109
So, definitely dive into this documentation

19
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.660
if you want to become a webpack master

20
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.720
and you want to have a more elaborate setup.

21
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.610
Our basic setup here, however, already allows us

22
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.200
to compile TypeScript files with webpack

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.940
and then bundle together all the output

24
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.820
into one single bundle.js file.

25
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.500
And we also setup a configuration for development

26
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.050
which makes debugging easier

27
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.510
and gives us more helpful error messages.

28
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.250
And we get a production setup

29
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.570
which gives us a highly optimized code

30
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840
which we then could deploy to a server

31
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.160
to ship as little code as possible to it.

32
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.210
And that's it.

33
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.740
webpack really is a core tool and being able to use it

34
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.573
and having a configuration

35
00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:30.260
that really just works, is super important.

36
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.800
So it is a must-use in any modern project, I would say,

37
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.710
and in this module, you'll learn how you can get started

38
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.763
with it in your TypeScript projects.
