<v ->Hi and welcome to this course.</v>

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.300
My name is Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.770
and I will be your instructor in this course.

4
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.540
Now this course is about TypeScript,

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.100
a super set to JavaScript so a programming language

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.860
which actually builds up on JavaScript.

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.500
You could say it takes JavaScript to the next level.

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.410
With TypeScript you will see in this course

9
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.310
you can write less error prone, much better

10
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.430
and cleaner code

11
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.910
and all the use and exciting new features

12
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.650
which don't exist like this in JavaScript.

13
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.630
Now in this course, you will learn TypeScript from scratch

14
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.060
you don't need to know anything about TypeScript

15
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.170
to get started.

16
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.750
Basic JavaScript knowledge absolutely suffices.

17
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.280
You will learn all the basics of TypeScript

18
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.300
how it works, why we use it,

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.268
the different advantages it offers

20
00:00:47.268 --> 00:00:50.420
We will dive into the core types it provides

21
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.310
and we will gradually build up knowledge and dive into

22
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.330
more and more advanced TypeScript features throughout

23
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.183
this course.

24
00:00:57.183 --> 00:01:01.810
Now this course is both a course that focuses on the theory

25
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.640
and showing a broad variety of features

26
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.270
as well as showing all these features

27
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.270
and action in real projects.

28
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.180
Therefore in this course, we will have a real project,

29
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.310
we will also have a module where we dive into TypeScript

30
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.890
with react, we will also have a module where we dive

31
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.430
into TypeScript with node and express

32
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.100
so that by the end of this course, you really feel

33
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.530
comfortable using TypeScript in your next projects

34
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.780
and that you know why you would use it

35
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.230
and most importantly how you would apply it

36
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.440
to any JavaScript project you are working on

37
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.400
no matter, by the way, if data is JavaScript in the browser

38
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.151
with or without any framework

39
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.200
or if it's on the server side.

40
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.060
So that's all in the course.

41
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.400
I'm super excited to start this journey together with you

42
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.790
and with that I would say let's not waste any time

43
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.250
and let's find out what exactly TypeScript is

44
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.410
and which advantages it has to offer
