00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.870
<v ->So now that we know about these powerful features,</v>

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.960
an obvious question is, why would we use that?

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.610
Why is that helpful?

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.200
Well, it is useful in situations like this,

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.780
where we know we want to have

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.820
a certain set of functionalities.

7
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.750
Let's say a greet method, and we want to ensure

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.910
that a clause has such a greet method,

9
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.450
and another clause has it maybe as well,

10
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.360
well, then, we can implement an interface

11
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.570
which forces the existence of this method.

12
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.690
Then we can easily share functionality amongst clauses,

13
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.850
and every clause has to add its own implementation,

14
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060
the exact code that should execute

15
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.450
when the method is called,

16
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.370
but we enforce a certain structure

17
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280
with the help of interfaces.

18
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.400
This can be useful if we don't have other parts of our code

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.550
which rely on that structure.

20
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.680
Here, we set user1 to be of type Greetable,

21
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.240
and with that we say we don't care what's inside user,

22
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.840
but what has to be in there is a greet method,

23
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.730
and we know that it has to be in there

24
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.510
because whatever we store in user1 has to be greetable.

25
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.350
That allows us to write truly powerful and flexible code

26
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.840
where we don't have to know everything about a object,

27
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.710
or everything about a clause,

28
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.710
but we just know whatever I'm getting here in user1

29
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.210
has to have a greet method.

30
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.850
We don't care whether Person has anything else,

31
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.630
here we're interested in greet,

32
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.400
hence we sent us to Greetable,

33
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.180
and therefore we can't store anything in user1

34
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.190
which would not have a greet method,

35
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.770
because Greetable forces whatever you base on it

36
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.333
to have such a greet method.
