1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Instructor>Now to finish up this application,</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.030
let's add some styling.

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.878
Attached you find a NewTodo.css

4
00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:08.690
and a TodoList.css file.

5
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.340
Simply drag and drop them into your components folder.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.570
And then in NewTodo.tsx,

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.860
let's import ./NewTodo.css.

8
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.660
This uses the behind the scenes

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.040
project setup we have here

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.040
which will pull out that CSS code

11
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.150
and then add it to our single page

12
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.130
HTML file we're using.

13
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.573
And in NewTodo component on the div,

14
00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:32.930
(mumbles) add a class here with a className prop

15
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.250
of form-control.

16
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.620
And with that added in TodoList,

17
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.620
of course import that ./TodoList.css file.

18
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.150
And with that one to do that,

19
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.820
you should have something that looks like this.

20
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.560
And there we can now add, Finish the course!

21
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.850
Finish it in one month!

22
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.370
And this looks a bit nicer, I'd say.

23
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.620
We also have the working buttons,

24
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.630
of course, still.

25
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.983
And that's our finished application here.
