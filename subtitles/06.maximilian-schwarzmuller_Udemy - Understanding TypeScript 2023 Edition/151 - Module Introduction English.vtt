00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.770
<v Instructor>In the previous modules,</v>

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.330
we worked on a project, and there,

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.260
we either had all our code in one file,

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.180
which made it hard to manage,

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.050
or we actually split it into multiple files

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.050
either by using name spaces or by using these ES6 modules,

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.040
but when using ES6 modules,

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.490
whilst our code was more manageable,

9
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.630
we actually had another disadvantage

10
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.520
into which I'll dive again in this module again.

11
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.720
In this module, we'll not only have a look

12
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.860
at that disadvantage again,

13
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.550
more importantly, we'll have a look

14
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.770
at the solution, Webpack.

15
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.370
So in this module, you will learn what exactly Webpack is

16
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.070
and, of course, then we'll all use it

17
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.400
to get a a setup, a project setup,

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.060
which gives us the best of all worlds, actually,

19
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.520
where we can write code split up into multiple files

20
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.590
without that disadvantage

21
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.623
and which we'll have a look at now.
