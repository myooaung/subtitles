00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.839
<v Instructor>You can search for Google</v>

2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.930
Geocoding API and you will find the official

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.210
Geocoding API Docs.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.130
The Geocoding API is an open API,

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.010
which you can use to translate an address

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.720
to a pair of coordinates

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.020
or a pair of coordinates to an address.

8
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.910
Now here, we wanna do a look up,

9
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.120
where we provide an address.

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.550
So, this normal geocoding request here

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.513
and get back coordinates.

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130
Now for that, we can send a request

13
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.020
to this URL but we need an API key to do that.

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.360
And we can get one for free.

15
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.690
All you need for that is a Google account

16
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.320
and (mumbling) a credit card.

17
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260
Unfortunately, you need that.

18
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.330
It will be free because there's a very generous

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.820
free tier, which you can use every month

20
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.570
and we will not exceed that free tier

21
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.480
with what we're doing here.

22
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.550
But still you need a credit card

23
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.890
to be able to use Google Maps features, unfortunately.

24
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.660
If you don't have such a credit card,

25
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.340
unfortunately, you can't use the API.

26
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.860
So, create a Google account

27
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.670
and then to get such an API key,

28
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.960
click on get started here.

29
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.160
And get started will take you to a page

30
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.310
where you can tell Google which features you want.

31
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.030
And we want the Places feature

32
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.160
because that includes the geocoding API

33
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.970
but we also want the Maps feature

34
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.010
because that will include the Google Maps

35
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.380
Java Script SDK, which we need a little bit later.

36
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.770
So, check these two and then click continue.

37
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.940
Next, you have to select a project

38
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.510
for which you want to enable this.

39
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.180
And you can even create a new one

40
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.803
or pick an existing one.

41
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.430
Once you do that, you are forwarded

42
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.150
and you should be asked whenever you want to

43
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.580
set up billing for this account.

44
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.003
Simply confirm this.

45
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.133
And after a while of waiting and loading,

46
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.400
you will be presented your API key,

47
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.540
which you can use.

48
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.330
Side note, you can also restrict the apps,

49
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.510
which are able to use that key

50
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.360
in this Google developer Console.

51
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.820
But here, we can just copy that key

52
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.190
and use it in our project.

53
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.560
So, let's store that key.

54
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.980
Maybe here in a constant.

55
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.193
Google API key.

56
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.930
And let's next focus on sending a request.

57
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.680
For that, let's again Google for Google Geocoding API,

58
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.570
so that we get this URL again here.

59
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.230
This URL is the URL to which we need to send the request.

60
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.130
And for that, we need some way of sending

61
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.730
a request from inside our type script

62
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.763
and therefore Java Script code.
