00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.273
<v Instructor>In this course,</v>

2
00:00:03.273 --> 00:00:05.280
you learned a lot about TypeScript,

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.850
and there is one particular use case,

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.710
one scenario where you could also TypeScript

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.310
which we hadn't had a look at thus far.

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.100
We've primarily focused on using TypeScript

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.870
to write browser site JavaScript code in the end.

8
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.590
And that is totally fine

9
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.740
and might be the most common use case

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.430
of working with TypeScript,

11
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.850
but it's not the only one.

12
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.800
You can also use TypeScript

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.390
to build Node.js applications,

14
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.870
also of course in conjunction with the popular

15
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.850
Express.js framework.

16
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.320
Now whilst Node.js on its own is not capable

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.940
of executing TypeScript,

18
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.880
in this module,

19
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.440
you will learn how you can still use TypeScript

20
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.710
to write Node.js scripts,

21
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.130
and we will build a very simple web application,

22
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.730
a very simple REST API here

23
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.810
where we also utilize TypeScript

24
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.310
on the server-side with Node.js and Express.

25
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.870
Just as in the React section,

26
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.400
here's a little disclaimer for this section.

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.000
This section here requires Node

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.470
and Express knowledge.

29
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.880
It's about using TypeScript with Node, Express,

30
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.340
it's not teaching Node from the ground up.

31
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.880
So if you've never heard about Node

32
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.210
and Express before,

33
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.430
definitely take some dedicated resources

34
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.340
like my Node.js The Complete Guide course first

35
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.600
before you explore this section.

36
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.593
So let's dive in.
