00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.100
<v Instructor>For this, attached you'll</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.590
find this starting project.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.510
It's the good old starting project we already know.

4
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.640
And there in app.ts, we can write some code.

5
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.960
In index.html, we got basically nothing.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.890
Now my goal here is very simple,

7
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.370
I wanna build a simple web application

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.452
where we can enter an address, then I want to look

9
00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:25.750
at this address and convert it into a pair of coordinates.

10
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.130
And we'll do this with help of Google,

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.420
with one of Google's APIs.

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.930
And then I want to render these coordinates,

13
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.660
I want to show these coordinates on a map,

14
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.260
which we will also render with help of Google Maps

15
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.180
or with help of Google, specifically with the help

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.060
of the Google Maps JavaScript SDK.

17
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.730
So we'll be working with two third party libraries here,

18
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.180
this HDP ascending library and the Google Maps library.

19
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.820
With that I'd say, let's get started.

20
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.350
Let's get started by building the very basic skeleton.

21
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.410
Now this is no html and no styling course,

22
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.280
so we'll keep this fairly simple.

23
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.629
I'll create a div here in index html

24
00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.360
which we'll get an id of map.

25
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.100
My goal is to render the map in this div later.

26
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.330
Now in this div at the moment, I'll add a paragraph

27
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.990
where I say, Please enter an address.

28
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.010
So that we see this paragraph whilst we haven't picked

29
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.630
a place yet.

30
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.430
Below this div I'll add a form without an action

31
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.050
and without a method because I will handle it in TypeScript.

32
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.050
And in this form I want to have an input of type "text",

33
00:01:40.127 --> 00:01:43.360
with an id of "address",

34
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.930
and below that a button of type "submit",

35
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.700
where I say SEARCH PLACE or SEARCH ADDRESS,

36
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.310
whatever you wanna say.

37
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.870
The goal is of course that when we submit this form,

38
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.150
we get the value the user entered here,

39
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.060
and then we convert this into coordinates,

40
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.430
which we render here on the map.

41
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.610
Now let's add some styling because we need at least

42
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.370
some basic styling.

43
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.700
Therefore I'll add a link here and point at "app.css",

44
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.240
which is a file we have yet to add.

45
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.982
In this CSS file I'll set up some very simple styles

46
00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:19.640
for the map.

47
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.200
I'll give it the width of 90% and a height of let's say

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.280
20rems, so that we see something on the screen,

49
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.693
a border of one pixel solid and a light grayish look,

50
00:02:29.693 --> 00:02:34.400
a margin of two rem top and bottom and auto left and right

51
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.010
to center it.

52
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.600
And then I will use display flex in there to set up

53
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.570
flex box where we can use justify content, center

54
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.920
and align items center to center this paragraph

55
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.860
which I show initially in the middle of this box.

56
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.650
I will also set text align to center

57
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.763
so that the text in the paragraph also is centered.

58
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.020
With that for the form we can also select this

59
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.320
by the form tag.

60
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.180
Here I also want to use text align center

61
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.670
to center this all in the middle of the screen,

62
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.623
so to say.

63
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.390
Give it a margin of two rem and auto so to add some spacing

64
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.060
between the map and the form and that should be it.

65
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.700
On the page we should now see something like this.

66
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.570
Now I wanna change my font here,

67
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.861
so for the overall html selector I'll set the font family

68
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:31.840
to Sans Serif, but with that I'm good.

69
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.860
And you can certainly style more.

70
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.020
You can certainly style this input or the button,

71
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.320
but I don't wanna worry too much

72
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.790
about the styling part here.

73
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.290
Instead I wanna make sure that this works.

74
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.010
But feel free to of course to improve the styling here.

75
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.218
With that prepared, however, let's make sure

76
00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:51.989
that now we actually fetch whatever the user entered here

77
00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.693
and looked it up with the help of Google.
