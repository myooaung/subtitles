00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.810 line:15% 
<v Narrator>In this course, you obviously learned a lot</v>

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.920 line:15% 
about TypeScript.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.740 line:15% 
And you also learned how to work with TypeScript,

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.610 line:15% 
and third party libraries, like Lodash.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.220 line:15% 
Now, there is a very popular third party library

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.060 line:15% 
which you might be interested in using

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.430 line:15% 
together with TypeScript, and that is React.

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.510 line:15% 
React JS is a extremely popular JavaScript library

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.240 line:15% 
for building amazing user interfaces.

10
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.350 line:15% 
And you can use it with TypeScript as well.

11
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.360 line:15% 
It's not the default, in most React projects

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.980 line:15% 
you don't work with TypeScript,

13
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.090 line:15% 
but you can absolutely do that,

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.122 line:15% 
and in this course module, you will learn how it works.

15
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.790 line:15% 
Now a little disclaimer at this point,

16
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.640 line:15% 
this is not a React course, I will not teach React here,

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.150 line:15% 
this module is for you, if you already know React,

18
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.040 line:15% 
and you wanna learn how to use TypeScript in React,

19
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.640 line:15% 
not if you don't know React and you wanna learn

20
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.350 line:15% 
both TypeScript and React together.

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.400 line:15% 
But with that, let's dive right in,

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.823 line:15% 
and let's see how we can build a React app, with TypeScript.
