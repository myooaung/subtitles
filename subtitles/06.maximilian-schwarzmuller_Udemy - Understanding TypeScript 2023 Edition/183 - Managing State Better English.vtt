1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.310
<v Lecturer>So how should we update the state instead?</v>

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.970
Well we can use our spread operator here,

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.680
and spread all our existing TODOs into this array

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.520
and then just add the new TODO as a new item at the end.

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.300
This works, but is not the cleanest way of updating this.

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.780
It will most likely work in all scenarios

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.090
we have in this app,

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.170
but theoretically react schedules state updates

9
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.050
and therefor what's in our TODOs value here,

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.490
might not necessarily be the latest state

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.710
when this update is performed.

12
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.360
To guarantee this we can pass a function to this

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.340
state updating function here though.

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.500
A function which gets our previous TODOs

15
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680
and which when then returns the new state.

16
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.460
This all is supported by react.

17
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.370
This function will also be called by react for us

18
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.340
and then we can rely on prevTodos inside of this function

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.363
to really be the latest state snapshot.

20
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.480
Now with that, we update our TODOs with the old TODOs

21
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.080
and the new one

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.100
and now we have a function here

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.860
where we should be able to add new TODOs.

24
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.800
So if we now save all of that

25
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.470
and we go back to the application

26
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.260
and then enter finish the course here, this works.

27
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.400
And if I enter finish it in one month here,

28
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.650
this is also added.

29
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.330
So this now all works.

30
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.960
The missing functionality

31
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.180
now is that we can also delete them.

32
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.790
We'll do this in the next lecture,

33
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.310
but more important than that,

34
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.470
you now also learned how to manage state

35
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.260
with react and typescript,

36
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.930
which besides props of course,

37
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.693
is another core concept.
