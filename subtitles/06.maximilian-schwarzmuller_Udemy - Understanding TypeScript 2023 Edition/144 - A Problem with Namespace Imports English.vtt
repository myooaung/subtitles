<v ->Now one important note, by the way,</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.280
you might be wondering why autobind works here

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.960
in ProjectList even though I didn't add a import

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.840
to the autobind decorator.

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.860
Well, because in app.ts, I have all these imports.

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.610
Now actually, if I remove these imports there,

7
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.430
which would be correct, because in here

8
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.010
I technically only use ProjectInput ProjectList is on,

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.253
we'll have a problem.

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.680
You see, if this reloads, we have an error here,

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.280
even though we get no compilation error unfortunately,

12
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.010
but we get a runtime error.

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.470
So we need to make sure we import everything

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.150
we use in a file into that file to be safe.

15
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.890
Technically, we can import everything in app.ts,

16
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.260
and since ProjectInput and ProjectList which,

17
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.320
for example, use the autobind decorator come later,

18
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.750
the autobind decorator will be available when they need it.

19
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.320
But this is not the cleanest possible way.

20
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.740
If you instead import everything a file needs

21
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.450
from inside that file,

22
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.540
you have to guarantee that this file

23
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.360
will have it available when it needs it,

24
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.400
and you're not relying on some global file

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.790
which imports everything,

26
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.500
where you then might remove an import

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.570
and suddenly, everything breaks.

28
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390
So, what's the solution here?

29
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.350
Well, let's go back to the files

30
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.530
and import what they need.

31
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.630
For example, ProjectInput does not just need

32
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.790
the base component, it also needs

33
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.270
the validation logic and autobind.

34
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630
So in here, I will import

35
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.110
by going up one level with two dots,

36
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.110
from decorators, the autobind decorator, whoops, like this,

37
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.366
and from util, the validation.ts file.

38
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:39.770
That is definitely needed in this file here.

39
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.210
I also need the project's state in here.

40
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.810
So I will import /state/project-state.ts.

41
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.690
And I will grab these imports and go to ProjectItem,

42
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.210
and there I don't need the project state and validation,

43
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.320
so we can remove that.

44
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.560
But we will need the autobind decorator.

45
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.580
We also need the draggable interface and the project model.

46
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.040
So we'll also go to the models folder here,

47
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.257
and import project.ts and drag-drop.ts.

48
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.720
In ProjectList, we won't need validation,

49
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.520
but I do need ProjectState and autobind.

50
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.100
And in addition from the models folder,

51
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.710
I need the project.ts file and the drag-drop.ts file.

52
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.840
With that just saves and compiles,

53
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.170
and now this all works again, as you see,

54
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.820
now we got no runtime errors, because now we got

55
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.520
all these imports back in the files.

56
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.380
So, this is the proper way of doing it,

57
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.060
every file specifies what it needs,

58
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.500
and we can split our code

59
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.310
and still end up with one file,

60
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.940
so we get the best of both worlds, we could say.

61
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000
Yet, this is not necessarily

62
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.963
the best possible way of doing it.
