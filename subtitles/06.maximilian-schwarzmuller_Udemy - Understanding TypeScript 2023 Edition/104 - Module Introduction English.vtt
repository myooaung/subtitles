<v Narrator>With generics out of the way,</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.780
let's dive into the next more advanced feature,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.860
that would be decorators.

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.100
Decorators are a feature

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.000
which can be very useful for meta-programming.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.230
Now what does meta-programming mean?

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.300
It means that you typically

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.430
won't use decorators that often

9
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.840
to have a direct impact on the end users of your page.

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.080
So off the users visiting your page,

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.150
but instead decorators are a particularly

12
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.550
well suited instrument for writing code

13
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.600
which is then easier to use by other developers.

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.120
Now that might sound strange,

15
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.280
but you'll see what I mean throughout this module.

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.213
In the end it all comes down to the fact that

17
00:00:43.213 --> 00:00:45.530
unlike with other code snippets,

18
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.320
let's say when we add an event listener,

19
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.260
we can easily write code which have a direct impact

20
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.810
on the users of our page.

21
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.970
If we register a listener on the button

22
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.740
and we show an alert after the button gets clicked,

23
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.320
then the user visiting our page immediately see something.

24
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.810
With decorators we don't typically work on that,

25
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.360
but instead we can for example guarantee that

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.690
one of our classes gets used correctly,

27
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.230
or a method in a class,

28
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.190
or we do some hidden transformations, stuff like that.

29
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.760
So in detail in this module,

30
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300
we'll see what exactly decorators are,

31
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.460
are about, and why we would use them.

32
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.850
We will of course use them

33
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.140
and you will learn about the different

34
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.760
types of decorators, types of supports.

35
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.650
And we'Ll see a couple of examples

36
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.350
that should make it clearer

37
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.233
which role decorators fill and why they can be useful.
