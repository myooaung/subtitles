00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Narrator>When it comes to building a React App</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.220
with Typescript, we of course need a project setup,

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.800
which is capable of both handling our React code,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.730
so things like JSX, for example,

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.480
and which compile stays and optimizes our React code,

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.500
and which at the same time, is capable of understanding

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.320
TypeScript and of compiling TypeScript to JavaScript.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.430
Setting up such a project on our own

9
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.750
can be pretty difficult,

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.940
and therefore, it's good that Create React App,

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.080
a tool managed by the React team,

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.420
which we can use to create React projects,

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110
supports TypeScript out of the box.

14
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
You can simply Google for Create React App TypeScript,

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.590
and you should find this entry on the official

16
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.000
Create React App documentation.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.140
There you'll learn how you can add TypeScript

18
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.540
to either an existing project,

19
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.850
here, these steps, or how you can create a new project

20
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.290
with Create React App and TypeScript,

21
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.400
and here you see a command which you can just copy,

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.030
to create a new React project,

23
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.680
which also supports TypeScript.

24
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.020 line:15% 
Now, I will use this here,

25
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.110 line:15% 
and here I already am in a folder, which I want to use.

26
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.210 line:15% 
This is simply the project folder

27
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.790 line:15% 
I want to use for this project.

28
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.900 line:15% 
And then we'll just paste in this command.

29
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.740 line:15% 
And in this case,

30
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.970 line:15% 
because I want to use the folder I am already in,

31
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.710 line:15% 
also here in my terminal,

32
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.190 line:15% 
I will replace the project name with a dot,

33
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.590 line:15% 
so that it doesn't create a new sub folder

34
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.550 line:15% 
and creates the project in that,

35
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.730 line:15% 
but that instead it uses this folder.

36
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.720 line:15% 
This is of course optional.

37
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.850 line:15% 
I also want to say that I noticed

38
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.070 line:15% 
that this command doesn't always work.

39
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.390 line:15% 
Sometimes it creates a regular JavaScript project.

40
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.590 line:15% 
To fix that,

41
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.343 line:15% 
you can install Create React App globally on your machine.

42
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.140 line:15% 
Something you can simply do by running

43
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.140 line:15% 
npm install -g create-react-app, on Mac and Linux you might

44
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.560 line:15% 
need to add a sudo in front of this.

45
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.360 line:15% 
And with this installed on your machine,

46
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.010 line:15% 
you can actually run this command here, but without npx,

47
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.920 line:15% 
just like this, and then it should definitely work.

48
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.270 line:15% 
So that's what I will do here,

49
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.320 line:15% 
but normally, it should also work without

50
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.250 line:15% 
installing it by just using the npx tool,

51
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.520 line:15% 
which is part of the npm tool we already installed

52
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.840 line:15% 
together with Node.js earlier in the course.

53
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.250 line:15% 
So for now it scaffolds a new project into this folder here.

54
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.460 line:15% 
And in that project, it will set up a React application

55
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.070 line:15% 
where we can all write all our code with TypeScript.

56
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.460 line:15% 
So let's wait for this to finish.

57
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.610 line:15% 
And let's see what this gives us.

58
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.010 line:15% 
And it finished.

59
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.930 line:15% 
So let's have a look at what we got.

60
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.000 line:15% 
We got a folder, which you might recognize it's basically

61
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.970 line:15% 
the same structure you have when you create a React App

62
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.500 line:15% 
without TypeScript.

63
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.790
But we can already see the tsconfig.json file.

64
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.020
By the way, you can also edit this file

65
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.940
and fine tune it to your needs.

66
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.250
You learned how to tweak this configuration

67
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.120
earlier in the course after all.

68
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.460
The default configuration should

69
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.160
be fine for most use cases, though.

70
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.950
Now if we explore the src folder,

71
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.230
which is where we will write our source code,

72
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.550
we also find a bunch of .tsx files in there.

73
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.900
Now thus far in the course, we didn't work with .tsx files,

74
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.787
but only with .ts files.

75
00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:17.800
.tsx simply has been chosen here, because these are files

76
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.530
where you cannot just write TypeScript code,

77
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.000
but all the JSX code,

78
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.570
which just is special React, JavaScript syntax,

79
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.930
where you write HTML markup inside of your JavaScript,

80
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.880
or in this case, TypeScript code.

81
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.920
That is what we get here.

82
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.500
Now in these files,

83
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.800
we can already see some TypeScript syntax,

84
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.480
for example, here, we got a type assignment,

85
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.880
I will have a closer look at this type later,

86
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.780
but for now, we just can immediately

87
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.290
see that we obviously use TypeScript here.

88
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.680
With that, let me just clean up

89
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.730
this starting folder structure a bit,

90
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.150
and then let's build a very simple React App together,

91
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.550
and whilst we're doing that,

92
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.000
let's explore how we can use TypeScript with React.

93
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.950
So let's first focus on the cleanup,

94
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.860
here in App.tsx, I will remove the logo import

95
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.380
and remove all the content in my div here,

96
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.020
and just keep that div therefore.

97
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.530
I will also remove the App.css import,

98
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.560
get rid of the App.css file and the App.test.tsx file

99
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.470
as well as the logo.svg and the serviceWorker.ts files,

100
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.500
remove all of those.

101
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.060
In index.tsx, I will remove this serviceWorker import,

102
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.100
because we're not going to work with serviceWorkers here,

103
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.530
remove that code down there,

104
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.870
and end up with this setup, and in index.css

105
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.610
I will clear all of this,

106
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.140
and just set up some HTML style

107
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.860
where I want to set a font-family of sans-serif,

108
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.190
and then a body style

109
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.820
where I want to get rid of the margin,

110
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.763
just like this, very simple styling.

111
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.540
And with that, we've got a starting setup

112
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.840
with which I want to work.

113
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.370
Now again, I did mention it,

114
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.710
but if this all doesn't tell you anything,

115
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.200
if this is syntax you've never seen before,

116
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.610
then definitely dive into some React resources first.

117
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.130
This is not what we will focus on in this module,

118
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.010
you're not going to learn React in this module.

119
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.920
But with that, let's save all our changes

120
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.680
and now continue, and let's start to write some

121
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.980
React and Typhon code, and learn how

122
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.543
these two things work together.
