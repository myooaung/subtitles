00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Instructor>Now, with all the things</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.240
we covered thus far in the course,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.400
it's now time to practice a bit.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.860
We're definitely not done with TypeScript.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.960
There are more things to explore

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.100
and more things we'll cover in the course,

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.860
for example, how we can combine TypeScript and React.

8
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.330
But for the moment, it's time to take a short break

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
and practice some of the things we learned about

10
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.440
in a little demo project.

11
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.460
Now, in this module, we'll work on this project together,

12
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.660
but I definitely encourage you

13
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.810
that you occasionally hit the pause button

14
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.530
and try the next steps on your own.

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.840
Of course, following along is also great and nice,

16
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.450
but you might learn a bit more

17
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.330
if you also try things on your own

18
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.260
before you then compare your solution to mine.

19
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.160
And with that, let's dive right in

20
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.183
and practice working with TypeScript.
