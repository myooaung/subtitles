00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.010
<v Instructor>In this module we'll dive</v>

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.400
into a concept called generics.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.890
Generics exist in TypeScript, not in vanilla JavaScript,

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.860
so there is no real translation here.

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.480
But we can utilize them in TypeScript.

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.200
And the concept of generic types

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.730
all exist in other programming languages.

8
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.950
Not in all other programming languages of course,

9
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.530
but in some, for example in C Sharp.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.290
Now this course of course is not about C Sharp though.

11
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.280
So let's have a look at what generics are

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.770
and what they are in TypeScript

13
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.410
and how we use them there and why we use them there.

14
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.450
Specifically, we'll have a look at what exactly generics are

15
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.000
and why they are interesting and helpful.

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.925
We'll then build our own generic functions and classes

17
00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.820
because, turns out, we can do that.

18
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
We'll then have a look at generic constraints

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.800
and what that is and why we would use something like that.

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
And we'll have a look at a couple

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.250
of special TypeScript types,

22
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.750
which also typically are generic

23
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.100
and which we'd ever only really can understand now.

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.963
So let's see what we got there.
