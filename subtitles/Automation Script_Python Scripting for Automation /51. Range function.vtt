00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
prints here.

2
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.390
We're going to discuss a boat range,

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.120
function off your python to simply arranged with some parenthesis.

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.050
It is a breathing function with your fight on.

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.450
Fine.

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:25.630
Which is used to generate only indigenous generate Indigenous on that as a list,

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.750
it is going to generate some indigent numbers as a list.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.550
Right?

9
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.750
Let me weapon my common lane on first off,

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.470
all I'm going toe enter into my python to actually,

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.950
we're discussing about Python three.

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.730
But I want to show you this.

13
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.470
Arrange or port with your fight on two as well,

14
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.140
right?

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
Let me bring range off some number.

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.020
You can take any number.

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.140
Sit output and let me bring range off some number this range off.

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.150
Number number fire.

19
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.760
How given.

20
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.080
So,

21
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.970
how many wells were getting $5 starting from Geo magazine value You were arrange number.

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.570
What are you are providing that minus one range of 30123 numbers.

23
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.060
But mags,

24
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.210
the number is three minus one.

25
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.350
That's what you are getting here,

26
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.350
right?

27
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.150
Fine.

28
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.030
No.

29
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.790
Let me come out from your fight on two under entering to fight on three.

30
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.260
Here also.

31
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.380
I'm tryingto print.

32
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.380
Arrange off fight sorry,

33
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.320
it's my spell.

34
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.790
Mystic Ranger fight,

35
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.250
then print range off three as well.

36
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.530
See in your piped onto directly or getting output as the list off the running range

37
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.120
function.

38
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.550
But whereas in Fight on three,

39
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.920
you are not getting directly a list,

40
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.650
but this is a arrange object,

41
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.820
but you can convert you arrange object or put India list by using type conversion procedure

42
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.690
that is list off range off.

43
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.520
Your number is going to get your list now.

44
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.250
Finally,

45
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.420
with help off your range function,

46
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.300
you're going to get a list off values or a sequence numbers final.

47
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.250
They all are indigent numbers,

48
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.850
right?

49
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.390
No,

50
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.670
Actually,

51
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.210
there is a small syntax with you are arrange function that is range start,

52
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.650
stop and then step.

53
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.330
So ranges.

54
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.950
Taking three arguments,

55
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.760
right,

56
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.690
So in there,

57
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.260
in there if you are very here Previously,

58
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.170
whenever if you run something like range fire range three,

59
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.440
you're not profiting.

60
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.100
Three arguments were providing only one argument Whenever.

61
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.910
If you provide only one argument,

62
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.750
like in this way,

63
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.550
that is called stop argument value,

64
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.930
then what about your start on step by default?

65
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.390
By default,

66
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.650
I mean,

67
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.400
if you don't provide any values for he was start then.

68
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.550
That is always Jiro.

69
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.330
And if you don't provide anywhere before he was step,

70
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.020
that is one.

71
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.850
Then what it is to start on step like,

72
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.850
let me explain you once again on your common life.

73
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.040
Suppose days if I try to print because this is fight on three.

74
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.620
That's way to show you your output directly as a list.

75
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.960
I need to convert your range Object in the A list.

76
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.350
That's what I'm doing here.

77
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.630
Suppose you were probably injure.

78
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.840
Fight one of the vilest you're getting right judo.

79
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.900
1234 I'm providing only one argument here.

80
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.100
So I know what if you provide only one argument for your range function that is always stop

81
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.650
value.

82
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.280
Right then what a bold start.

83
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.250
Start immensity with what number you're starting,

84
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.620
Geo.

85
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.650
There is a default value.

86
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.200
If you don't provide any start number,

87
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.850
it is going to start with Jiro on then from there onwards five values.

88
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.510
Yes,

89
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.350
You're getting finally $5.

90
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.200
And what is the maximum number?

91
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.050
It was stopped minus one is the maximum number.

92
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.440
Right now I am giving Jiro Come off.

93
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.830
I see The difference is their indifference nor difference whether you are going to provide

94
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.570
start as Jiro or even if you don't provide a start value by default.

95
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.470
It is zero on waterboard Step Step is nothing but difference between any 262 numbers.

96
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.880
What is the difference between one and zero?

97
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.250
One,

98
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.350
21113 and 114 and 131 right?

99
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.670
The difference between any two successful numbers either step So how you arranged function

100
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.950
is going to generate a number.

101
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.750
A bite afforded will take start number Jiro if you don't provide at the time.

102
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.010
Also default is Jiro,

103
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.220
then Jiro plus one is the next number.

104
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.880
One plus one toe.

105
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.830
There is a second number two plus +133 plus +14 Likewise,

106
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.950
you can increase your numbers up to some numbers,

107
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.820
but judo to fight five values range is five minutes.

108
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.190
05 Ella's yard to get that means your range from is going to count.

109
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.700
One,

110
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.400
2345 Upto this violation is going to give right now.

111
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.550
Let me provide with step as a in your range function.

112
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.000
If I come of one,

113
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.850
that is a step So start stop on the instep.

114
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.220
Is there any difference nor difference?

115
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.800
Let me provide some.

116
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.460
Do you know 22 step as one seed.

117
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.370
Output judo step means one minus 01 to minus 113 minus one.

118
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.530
That's what step No.

119
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.210
I want to gender numbers with the step as to what is the meaning for that start number

120
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.750
Digital,

121
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.020
then Geo place to there is a second number.

122
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.810
I need then to place to 44 plus 266 plus two Yate.

123
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.620
That's what I need on,

124
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.200
like ways.

125
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.040
One of the numbers you're going to get eight.

126
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.650
Let me.

127
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.870
Right.

128
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.520
First of all,

129
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.720
all possible numbers.

130
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.270
Well,

131
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.150
14 16 18 2022 like ways.

132
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.230
But what is the my Exume number?

133
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.160
How when you are I mean,

134
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.040
stop number 20 if it is 20.

135
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.480
Stop number Always.

136
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.450
You're going to get stop minus one as the maximum value inside off your list.

137
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.210
That means 19.

138
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.350
But if you start with Joe and if I step as to nobody will get 19 you'll get 18.

139
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.070
Is the magazine number right after rating?

140
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.810
If I step two,

141
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.660
you're going to get 20.

142
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.950
But going to you should not take range function is going to give magazine number minus one

143
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.950
.

144
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.830
Actually,

145
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.930
you need to get up to 19.

146
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.790
But you're generating with steppers too.

147
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.650
That's why magazine number is I didn't know.

148
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.250
See the output?

149
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.250
That's what.

150
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.810
Now,

151
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.650
if you want to get up to 20 just take 21 when you will get up to 20.

152
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:50.230
But now values are Jiro 2468 10 12 14 16 1920 with step two not only step,

153
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.140
we can take any step.

154
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.350
Let me take three as a step.

155
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.810
Let me next about some seven.

156
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.300
So,

157
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:04.100
Joe starting number judo plus 7 +77 Place 7 14 14 plus 7 21 But one day one is actually you

158
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.050
were steps Stop!

159
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.120
Stop Value stop minus one before 21 yard to get it.

160
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.030
I mean up to 14.

161
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.710
You are getting right.

162
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.850
This is the uses off your range function.

163
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.780
Not only that,

164
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.580
let me do it.

165
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.630
Simply print Range off.

166
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:26.050
Let's say I want to print 10 Comotto starting value 10 ending value to Is it possible?

167
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.850
I know what XX is.

168
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.790
We're going toe from right to left.

169
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.100
Sorry.

170
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.390
Left to right in your X axis,

171
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.970
right if you take your X axis,

172
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.950
you're always trying to write your data from left to right somewhere it anyhow,

173
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.510
year somewhere to you How year it's not possible,

174
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.850
right?

175
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.150
That's why what you're going to get that by default you're going to get.

176
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.830
See,

177
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:56.010
that would put let me print it as a list so that you can see the result empty.

178
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.340
But if I provided step see that first I need to get somewhere lewd.

179
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.250
Then I want to decrease with minus one.

180
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.150
No,

181
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:10.250
see that some very how 10 some very how to.

182
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:17.450
But what I'm saying is I can't get more than 10 because if I take 10 come into range.

183
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.290
But what I'm saying start with,

184
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.750
then decrease directly or saying there don't go towards right by default.

185
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.250
You were data will go while writing from left to right.

186
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.070
But don't go towards right.

187
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.300
That's what we're saying with step as minus one.

188
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.150
That's when now you're getting decreasing data,

189
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.050
right?

190
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.050
Fine.

191
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.930
Now let me do one more thing.

192
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:48.650
I want to get data from suppose minus two to minus tan by the fourth step is one right?

193
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.460
Let me read your x axis somewhere here home minus stand.

194
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.440
So I'm very hard.

195
00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.150
It as minus two by the fourth step is one Suppose if you start with the minus tool,

196
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.250
what is your step?

197
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.760
Bless one.

198
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.550
So next year,

199
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.050
days minus to plus one means minus one.

200
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.750
This is not in this range.

201
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.050
So again,

202
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.470
actually,

203
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:14.820
if you're writing minus two minus two to minus 10 means we're not coming in this way by

204
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.550
default your pipe and we'll go from left to right.

205
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.620
But forcefully,

206
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.330
How to say,

207
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.730
please go towards the left.

208
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.040
That is with a step minus one might not only minus when you can take minus two or minus

209
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.010
tree whatever it may be,

210
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:32.850
that's a right fine.

211
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:38.010
So this is the way how you can generate your list off values based on your requirement.

212
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.800
Know how a small requirement generate?

213
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:51.900
Even numbers suppose from between 1 200 simply I can do it.

214
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.670
Bring list.

215
00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:00.970
Arrange off from 1 201 200 in this range.

216
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.850
I want to get even numbers.

217
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.250
Right.

218
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.080
So what is the first even numbers?

219
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.160
Let me take Jiro then for Gina.

220
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.860
Just are too No.

221
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.950
See the result these all out even the most you are getting between 1 200 Then your today

222
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.510
would not want to see the result.

223
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.450
Now you're going to get property with numbers.

224
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:21.870
Now,

225
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.980
I want to get our numbers.

226
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.850
Start with one.

227
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:33.200
Then you're going to get our numbers between 1 200 They I last point.

228
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.130
See if you have a list.

229
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.380
Let's say I have a list of called some random numbers.

230
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.550
It may be any value,

231
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.650
right?

232
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.660
Directly injured off printing your and pair list.

233
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.170
If I want to go with for Luke,

234
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.040
I can take in this way.

235
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.260
No.

236
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.550
For each in your list,

237
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.650
I can print one by one each.

238
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.580
See,

239
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.250
that isn't the same day.

240
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.740
You can also use range function year because range or put is finally a list.

241
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.120
No,

242
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.700
I'm begging.

243
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.610
Supposed range of four not see that.

244
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:11.110
But you're going to get data from 0 to 3 now in your brain function by default.

245
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.450
It is in terrible anywhere for Luke.

246
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.560
No,

247
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.950
with this,

248
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.190
we have a small requirement in this way.

249
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.640
What is?

250
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.250
That means I generally have a list to call any data.

251
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:29.110
Something like this.

252
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.780
Okay,

253
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.050
so that is how many values you have in your list,

254
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.210
you can find out with help off lend logical.

255
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.950
You can find out nothing to count it.

256
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:44.850
Fight Then if we are having five or lose what are the index values for your list?

257
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:50.660
It will end this fight if Atlantis fly by default index values are 0 to 4.

258
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:59.230
We know that even if you can count it fighters in next Jiro 1234 You don't before Now you

259
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:06.870
fino lend if you know land without counting without counting the index values 40 were given

260
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.290
list range off lent off.

261
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:14.190
Your list is biting for it is going toe you you were index value.

262
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:21.040
So if you are given list And here this is the range object If you want to see in detail

263
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.750
what are the values inside off that?

264
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.150
Just try to convert that as a list and see the output.

265
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.120
No,

266
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.210
With help off range automatically,

267
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.510
you can find out the index of Alice where you're given list without county.

268
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.690
No.

269
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.850
Based on this concept,

270
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.950
what I'm doing is see that,

271
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:46.480
See if I want to print first value from your list one out today in this week,

272
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.300
then second do 1234 But using for loop already we know this concert,

273
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.250
but using range function I'm telling that for each index,

274
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.250
anyone range off lent off your list.

275
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.700
First of all,

276
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.820
I'm printing index.

277
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.820
What is the next you're going to get that is there in your each elex,

278
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.600
right?

279
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.550
Just observe that would put what you're going to get.

280
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.430
You're going to get automatically your next values.

281
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.710
No.

282
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:18.200
After this,

283
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.700
I want to print based on this index value or based on the values from your range function.

284
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.850
I want to print the values off my list.

285
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.060
See,

286
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.630
How can I print value?

287
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.550
It was too.

288
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.150
Or anything.

289
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.990
You want a list with the help off your index from your range function,

290
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.870
try to understand.

291
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.210
Here,

292
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.650
See the output woman.

293
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:49.050
Let me save it and done it can see the output you're getting automatically your values.

294
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.220
So here we are not taking my list.

295
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.920
I have taken only the length off your list on I'm able to find index values from your range

296
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.450
function.

297
00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.350
Then what I'm doing is I'm bringing your index.

298
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.020
Then I am taking you at least logically,

299
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:12.470
I'm substituting your index value from this Because this is now Jiro 1234 index values one

300
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.690
by one I'm taking with your each index Variable that index variable.

301
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.960
I'm stop shooting with help off your list so that you are going to get my list off.

302
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.360
Jiro,

303
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:19.840
that is nothing.

304
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.610
About five miles east off one my list off 23 and four.

305
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.280
Right?

306
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:24.720
So,

307
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.630
logically,

308
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:31.380
you can ableto get your list off values based on index And you are generating your your

309
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.250
index values based on your range function your help off your range function.

310
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.050
Okay.

311
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.660
So,

312
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.040
guys,

313
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.870
we will use in so many cases you arrange function well,

314
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.340
practicing with your scripts for time.

315
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:44.610
Me?

316
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.710
These are the basics to work with the world.

317
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.150
Arrange function.

318
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.730
Okay,

319
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.820
so ranges very,

320
00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.150
very helpful in your for Lou.

321
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.400
Okay.

322
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.910
Okay,

323
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.180
guys,

324
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.550
Thank you for watching this video.
