00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
friends here.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.480
We're going to implement one simple python skit That is simply how to change current

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.400
working there A tree?

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.730
Si Chen yin current working there.

5
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.310
A tree with fight on is very easy.

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.700
Let me enter into my fight on three terminal.

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.970
Right?

8
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.950
And I'm going to import ways model.

9
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.250
Let me show you That weighs dot current working that everywhere we are,

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.710
we know we have ways dot Can't get current working that a distant tax already We have seen

11
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.220
all these indexes in our previous videos.

12
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.450
Right,

13
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.510
Fine.

14
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.350
Now suppose I want to move or change my current working directory to something.

15
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780
Some location.

16
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.740
I'm giving some part.

17
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.250
I'm giving.

18
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.050
No,

19
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.390
it has been excluded.

20
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.640
No,

21
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.200
Let me check it where we are.

22
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.550
No.

23
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.860
Get current working directory under rule.

24
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.110
Really?

25
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.350
See?

26
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.570
So if you write these three lines right,

27
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.950
then you're script is over.

28
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.760
But sometimes Well,

29
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.740
changing your directory,

30
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.350
you'll get some exceptions.

31
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.050
Let me show you them.

32
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.180
I suppose what I'm doing is changed out of three d.

33
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.550
C.

34
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.250
I will do one thing first,

35
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.300
So let me movinto temp on.

36
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.430
Let me create Haidar Txt on.

37
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.260
Let me create battery.

38
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.450
Fine.

39
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.350
No,

40
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.590
I'm entering into my five country.

41
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.770
Right.

42
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.250
Let's make sure this is by countries in taxes.

43
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.330
So how small?

44
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.840
Different 70 or pipe country?

45
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.540
I'm in.

46
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.490
Come back to bite on.

47
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.350
Right.

48
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.440
Find first,

49
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.900
let me import ways model.

50
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.890
Then ways don't get current working battery right?

51
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.050
Then I'm changing into suppose.

52
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.850
Root them now What is your current working directory?

53
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.750
Fine.

54
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.800
No,

55
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.730
Anywhere we are in route.

56
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.270
Um but just as in that you are in location,

57
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.800
but I'm trying to provide Ruto them and then high dot txt.

58
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.890
So hide architect is a file,

59
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.190
right?

60
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.250
We can't move into that.

61
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.720
I guess you probably by mistake that has the path to change right through your python.

62
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.450
Then you're going to get an exception.

63
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.950
What is that exception?

64
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.680
Northern Directory error,

65
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.750
Right?

66
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.250
Just to make a note on this so that finally will create complete straight.

67
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.920
So that is one of the exception you're going to get when you're going to get that Northern

68
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.350
Territory exception.

69
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.310
Know what I'm doing is where is dot changed at a tree?

70
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.650
Root em hello dot Txt?

71
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.190
See that?

72
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.150
I know what you're getting.

73
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.930
File not found it because actually,

74
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.020
whatever the part you're providing that is not present on your host.

75
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.810
In that case,

76
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.650
you're going to get exception in this way.

77
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.000
Right now.

78
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.750
Let me making note on this as well.

79
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.650
Then let me movinto one more than a tree.

80
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.460
So some was how?

81
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.550
Route 80 c.

82
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.210
So hedge TPD there.

83
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.050
How something file called cons?

84
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.010
No.

85
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.440
See there.

86
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.350
What is the exception?

87
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.200
You're getting about a mission?

88
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.550
ETA,

89
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.890
so permission denied.

90
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.820
Actually have a part,

91
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.930
but you don't have permission to enter into that data tree,

92
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.590
right?

93
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.830
So So changing Directory.

94
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.090
What?

95
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.550
King directory is very simple.

96
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.650
Simply ways not changed at a tree.

97
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.490
But why?

98
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.860
Working in your real time?

99
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.750
You will get these type off exceptions then.

100
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.960
But nobody feel writing a python skit.

101
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.050
It should work in all scenarios.

102
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.050
That's why you to think about all possibility exceptions.

103
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.640
No,

104
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.040
these are the possible the ex systems.

105
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.800
You exceptions.

106
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.410
You have for your change.

107
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.020
Definitely.

108
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.920
No,

109
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.070
you know,

110
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.250
divided by transcript.

111
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.770
Right?

112
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.750
So what I don't want to do is first Hannity input ways.

113
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.430
I first I'm going to implement this scripture in terms off.

114
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.240
I mean,

115
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.160
without functions.

116
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.080
Then after that,

117
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.770
I will show you in terms off simple function so that you will get practiced with your

118
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.550
functions as well.

119
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.670
Okay,

120
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.550
fine import ways.

121
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.640
So I'm going to read a required part from the user.

122
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.650
So required particles tojust use inputs impacts.

123
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.310
So entirely were change buttercream and that part two Change that.

124
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.750
A tree.

125
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.490
Nothing,

126
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.450
Right?

127
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.840
Just for the user understanding purpose.

128
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.150
We are giving this print Mrs.

129
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.280
So before went to change.

130
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.150
Let me print simply the current working directory Ease.

131
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.420
So you know how we can get with ways,

132
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.150
ways dot Get cwt,

133
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.890
then No days.

134
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.570
So you're going to get an exceptions,

135
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.850
right?

136
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.860
So you can easily handle with the prior and accept blocks.

137
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.810
So what I am doing is Hi.

138
00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:02.350
So what I'm trying is ways dot Change your daughter three on a quiet pot.

139
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.230
So you're going to read the part from the input side,

140
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.450
right?

141
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.250
Monk is if it is works perfectly,

142
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.900
then I can drink Simply now.

143
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.800
You were new working Barrick three piece.

144
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.100
Then I can say simply ways don't get cwt.

145
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.130
But why changing your part while tending your garden?

146
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.700
You're going to get some exceptions,

147
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.890
right?

148
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.750
We already taken those exceptions.

149
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.850
No,

150
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.480
in case very first chance.

151
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.450
Let me take this one.

152
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.210
That given part is not existing.

153
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.120
Then then you're going to get this exception.

154
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.860
Then I'm handling this except in case file,

155
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.820
not phone error.

156
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.650
Then I can say simply,

157
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.550
Please verify given.

158
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.670
But are you in part?

159
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.890
Is not a valid parts given,

160
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.810
but is not a valid,

161
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.450
but that's it are.

162
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.000
Sometimes you're providing valid part,

163
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.850
but you're going to provide file parts,

164
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.270
then accept not a territory exception.

165
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.750
Then I can save drink given bought.

166
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.550
He's a file park.

167
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.650
So on change.

168
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.000
Working direct three.

169
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.040
So same information.

170
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.820
If you want to write,

171
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.190
you can also write anywhere file,

172
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.850
not phone.

173
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.490
And also that's it.

174
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.660
Right.

175
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.150
Then you have one more exception.

176
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.010
Even though if you provide value part violent territory part sometimes you may not have

177
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.890
access to enter in the dark directory,

178
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.780
then permission alot then printed simply Saudi.

179
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:07.550
You don't how access could change.

180
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.940
Okay,

181
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.950
you don't know access to access for the given,

182
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.050
but so go on change.

183
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.750
You can write any message whatever you want.

184
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.090
That's it.

185
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.830
Other than this,

186
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.750
in case you forget any other any new exceptions just to handle that exception except

187
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.230
exception as he let me print that exception.

188
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.340
In case if you get any new exceptions than you can handle them,

189
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.920
you can see them here so that in future it can our them right.

190
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.650
That's it.

191
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.840
I now let me exit from here,

192
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.070
and I'm going to write a simple pie transcript change that It would not be way.

193
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.180
That's it.

194
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.250
Now let me save it and help me on this with fight on three.

195
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.350
So I didn't provided,

196
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.750
uh,

197
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.920
she Bangla.

198
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.500
And if you want,

199
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500
you can probably and that it weakened rate by giving execution permission,

200
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.580
you can run dark slash Okay.

201
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.850
Something out of how given wealth?

202
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.640
Yeah.

203
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.630
Two quotations.

204
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.190
Let me remove one quotation.

205
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.370
No,

206
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.010
it's fine.

207
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:27.390
So I'm going to provide Rudy de si now your new working that it reasonably DC Let me rely

208
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.080
on and I'm going to provide Wrote it.

209
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.650
This is something like X Weiser.

210
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.500
I'll see that given part is not a valid part.

211
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.120
So can change working directly.

212
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.990
No,

213
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.660
let me provide.

214
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:44.340
Who did he see are something like hedge duty Pretty than conference Sorry.

215
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.530
You don't know Access forgiven park so can change your contentedly So if you ever clearly

216
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.530
changing?

217
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.510
You are working there.

218
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.970
A tree is very simple court.

219
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.230
Where's dot change territory.

220
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.730
But while changing in your real time,

221
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.090
you'll get some exceptions,

222
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.850
so you have to ready to handle them.

223
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.950
So now we handle them in our core.

224
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.510
So busy is simply your simple by transferred.

225
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.150
But now I want to implement same script in terms off functions.

226
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.780
Anyway,

227
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.170
I'm not going to write a deep off functions simply,

228
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.500
I'm writing with a simple function.

229
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.190
So guys,

230
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.330
we know that it's better to start.

231
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.900
You were called always with,

232
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.750
if underscore underscore name.

233
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.010
The reason is,

234
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.260
but what if someone he's going to import your court at that time?

235
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.920
You can hide.

236
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.960
They were main logic.

237
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.350
They can use only one main function.

238
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.550
So that's it.

239
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.520
No,

240
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.540
let me simply right anyway.

241
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.520
Just import your model.

242
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.480
Surveyed our very first line right?

243
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.770
Then start with if underscoring the school.

244
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.650
Then write your main function.

245
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.670
So I have No,

246
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.680
I'm not going to write any number of functions.

247
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.580
I'm going to write only one function so inside of this function.

248
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.190
Just I'm writing this logic just for your understanding purpose.

249
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.550
That's it.

250
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.010
No,

251
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.890
let me provide indentations other ways you will get another.

252
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.260
I mean,

253
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.580
you'll get an inundation at a light.

254
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:17.650
That's it.

255
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.650
So now you're function Is woman anyway,

256
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.010
as off?

257
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.340
No,

258
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.990
I'm not expecting anything from your main function to your if condition that way simply at

259
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.340
the end.

260
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.850
I'm writing return None.

261
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.860
That's it.

262
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.000
So I commentary What previous court?

263
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.560
Same court.

264
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.360
Just I heard inside off your main function.

265
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.700
That's it,

266
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.680
Right?

267
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.470
So let's be clear,

268
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.450
but nobody for trying to write your court.

269
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.770
It's always very to start with the or if condition and then some.

270
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.490
Not only men you can take any functioning,

271
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.550
but generally will take me.

272
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.640
Just write that main function here.

273
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.630
That's it then.

274
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.550
Inside that you're right your la Z That's fine.

275
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.490
No,

276
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.150
let me run it.

277
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.810
So before going to run,

278
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.450
let me provide she Bangla in as well.

279
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.750
So this is my fight on location.

280
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.250
So I want to provide this that very first line in my court.

281
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:10.080
That's it.

282
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.630
No,

283
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.350
I'm going to provide execution permissions for my script.

284
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.980
No,

285
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.550
I can done my script in this way.

286
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.790
No,

287
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:23.950
I'm providing permission denied part So I have some part on my host for each.

288
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.840
I don't know access.

289
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.450
We'll see that.

290
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.170
Okay.

291
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.690
So,

292
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.040
guys,

293
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.360
there's a simple way to handle it.

294
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.320
Were our script with exceptions.

295
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.750
Whenever if you want to change your working directory through your python script,

296
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.950
Okay?

297
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.320
Okay.

298
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.850
Thank you for watching this with you.
