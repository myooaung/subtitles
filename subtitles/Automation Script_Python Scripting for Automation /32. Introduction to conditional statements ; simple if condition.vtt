00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
friends here.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.680
We're going to discuss a bold,

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.320
conditional statements off python C.

4
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.660
Conditional statements are very,

5
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.580
very important.

6
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.050
While writing your scripts,

7
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.340
let me weapon one off for a previous a script that is just displaying it will string when

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.080
you were Ah,

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.000
terminal in the line of the right side or left side or in the center off the line.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.150
Right.

11
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.850
We have already seen aboard this script.

12
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.430
No,

13
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.270
let me weapon my command line from there.

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.550
I want to run this script.

15
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.330
So actually,

16
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.930
this script is there under my desktop by don script.

17
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.150
So let me open your script one second and I'm going to run this.

18
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.900
So it is asking and very well string.

19
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.680
So I'm going to enter some string.

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.300
Yes,

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.910
you're getting some all put in the center left side and then right side.

22
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.750
That's fine.

23
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.150
But here I have a small requirement.

24
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.820
By default you are displaying.

25
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.850
You are a string in a center left and right side on a line.

26
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.970
But by default,

27
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.190
I don't want to print.

28
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.550
If I ask Ally in my text,

29
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.870
then only you How do print other way just to print a normal way how you're going to print?

30
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.470
They were Are this?

31
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.730
Oh,

32
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.530
you're going to display your data with your pipes on Prince Street,

33
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.750
man,

34
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.950
that means,

35
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.990
But we do this print simply.

36
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.890
You were string whatever you have,

37
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.150
right.

38
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:50.750
My requirement is if I run my script how to display only with your prints.

39
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.290
Statement.

40
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.110
I don't want toe bring the remaining values.

41
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.450
I mean in the centre,

42
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.250
the left aside and light side.

43
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.110
If I ask while running script,

44
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.940
please align my text then only how to display this.

45
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.250
Otherwise I don't want to display.

46
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.960
Then how you can control there How you can control displaying your data in the middle of

47
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.150
centre or left or right?

48
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.130
Right.

49
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.870
See that?

50
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.950
What I'm doing is I'm writing something.

51
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.150
I'm writing something that is called If I'm writing falls,

52
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.450
I'm writing false.

53
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.950
And then under this line,

54
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550
I'm going to write the word three lines.

55
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.950
See the script?

56
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.910
No.

57
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.750
Here.

58
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.350
I'm controlling the execution off these three lines with this line.

59
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.230
So here I am,

60
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.620
writing false falls means you are whatever the line you hear that line won't exclude these

61
00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.350
three lines.

62
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.550
Let me go with this simple explanation.

63
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.210
Yes,

64
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.570
I Jimmy,

65
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.950
have a room for that.

66
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.800
There is a lock,

67
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.250
right?

68
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.170
No,

69
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.050
you are here.

70
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.350
I want to enter into this room.

71
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.190
Don't say that.

72
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.230
I can break the walls are door lock.

73
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.930
I can end up in a legal way.

74
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.870
I want to enter.

75
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.020
Like see if we have a keen Orhan right?

76
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.880
Then only you can enter into this room.

77
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.620
Otherwise you cannot enter the same thing.

78
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.550
I'm checking here.

79
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.020
If you false means you don't have a key.

80
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.140
If you don't have a key the lines which are there under this line these three lines are

81
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.150
there under that line.

82
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.850
This is like a room.

83
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.510
Some sort of statements block off court.

84
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.200
These lines won't execute.

85
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.400
Right?

86
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.550
First observed output.

87
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.550
I'm telling that I don't have a key in my hand.

88
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.480
Then you can't exclude these lines.

89
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.810
You can't enter into the room if if you enter into the room,

90
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.810
you can do any action,

91
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.950
right?

92
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.380
So I don't have a key in my hand.

93
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.650
That's why I can't exclude these three lines.

94
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.500
So guys took control.

95
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.150
Execution part of some sort off lines are maybe one line.

96
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.540
First of all,

97
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.230
you have to write If something may be false are pretty hard right then under that you have

98
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.600
to write.

99
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.960
You are controlling lines which lines you want to control while writing some lines under

100
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.240
this.

101
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.290
If line under if line,

102
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.050
you have to provide some space.

103
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.120
If you don't provide space,

104
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.950
you will get another.

105
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.740
Because these like your room under that You have these lines.

106
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.050
So that's why auto provide some space.

107
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.550
Okay,

108
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.090
I just operate block Not like we weapon my script on.

109
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.290
Let me first I will do this thing.

110
00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.450
Clear my screen on the sea He was script and now I'm going to run this.

111
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.450
See the output?

112
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.350
I'm wondering simply Python.

113
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.060
You're getting only piped on output.

114
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.950
You're not displaying these things.

115
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.710
You're not getting an output from this.

116
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.620
The reason is directly or telling to your if condition this is,

117
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.300
if apparently are telling to your If I don't have a key then you've doesn't allow to

118
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.450
exclude this lines.

119
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.470
No one I'm doing is badly.

120
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.550
I'm telling to my if I have a key then you ought to write the truth.

121
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.350
Then you had rightto through.

122
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.220
Yes,

123
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.250
now I didn't improve.

124
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.450
That means now I'm telling to my python I have it true.

125
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.650
I have it key for my room.

126
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.160
Then see that now you heard and through their.

127
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.630
And if you run your core,

128
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.950
see that you're getting your output in three different ways,

129
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.550
right?

130
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.650
Fine.

131
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.930
But here,

132
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.290
whenever.

133
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.890
If you want to display or put your writing proof or never,

134
00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.650
never if you want,

135
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.990
if you don't want to display or what you're writing false.

136
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.000
But you should not right like that.

137
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.370
Because while running your skip,

138
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.750
you can't go on Marty for your script.

139
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:17.290
That's why what I'm doing is here you can write some expression such that the result maybe

140
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.240
true or false.

141
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.230
If it is true,

142
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.180
you can get your output.

143
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.940
If it is false,

144
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.590
you can get your you won't get your foot in that your great some expression.

145
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.860
So for that one,

146
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.670
I'm doing this.

147
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.500
I am reading some user option user options.

148
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.650
You can take any variable I'm taking user option,

149
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.150
our user confirmation.

150
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.190
So I'm asking the user,

151
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.050
Do you want to Elaine fixed?

152
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.330
Say yes or no?

153
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.600
Right.

154
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.380
So if user says yes,

155
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.640
then only I want to exclude this lines.

156
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.980
If you that say it's no,

157
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.050
I don't want to execute,

158
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.750
right?

159
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.390
So now,

160
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.910
in travel writing prove what I'm doing is user confirmation.

161
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:18.280
If it is you close to us like suppose well running your spirit be free under Yes then yes

162
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.690
equals two.

163
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.150
Yes,

164
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.380
that means proof.

165
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.710
If you remember,

166
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.090
we we learn about comparison operators.

167
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.620
If I right some X equals three x.

168
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.300
That is true.

169
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:37.050
No If I right some yes equals two Yes brew.

170
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.880
If I write no equals two?

171
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.330
Yes.

172
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.450
Then that is false.

173
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.180
No.

174
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:51.040
While writing skip wild running script you're providing yes or no option Based on that,

175
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.870
your python is going to compare if user input user confirmation is equals to Yes Then this

176
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.350
is true.

177
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.320
We know if this is true.

178
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.600
You are if with a lot,

179
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.880
to exclude this lines.

180
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.850
If this volume is not equals two yes then this result is false.

181
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.140
That's why finally the expression result is false.

182
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.450
Then you're if doesn't elope Exclude this lines.

183
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.180
See?

184
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:20.180
I'm going to run my court First of all,

185
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.430
observe your script right now I'm going to run Enter your escape.

186
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.960
Let me run!

187
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.470
Fight on!

188
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.870
Maybe I forgot to sell this court.

189
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.720
Let me save it.

190
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.610
I sail on.

191
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.340
Let me read on.

192
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:41.810
So fight on Elaine fixed.

193
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:47.200
And the real string I'm on drink pytorch you guys because off this line.

194
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.320
So from Miller previous string operation practice,

195
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.660
right?

196
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.630
You know what is the use off import ways?

197
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.610
And this one you are importing pretty different model.

198
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.050
And from that you are using one of the operation to get your columns.

199
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.430
That's fine.

200
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.730
No,

201
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.930
because off this line enter your string.

202
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.610
It is asking.

203
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.650
I'm wondering Python.

204
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.580
Then after that imagery or printing your string Yes.

205
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.250
You're getting that output along with that because of this line.

206
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.710
Do you want to align?

207
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.680
Text say yes,

208
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.050
Armel.

209
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:25.000
Suppose if I say yes then this yes is going to store into your this variable right on that

210
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.000
.

211
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.370
Very well.

212
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.450
Im combating here.

213
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.910
If this value stored in your user confirmation if it is Yukos Yes,

214
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.950
then finally this expression result is proof.

215
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.470
If it is true,

216
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.610
then this youth will allow to exclude these three lines.

217
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.180
Right?

218
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:48.640
Im don't put one second.

219
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:48.930
Yeah.

220
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.250
Let me mags I minimized my skin.

221
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:51.580
Yeah,

222
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.410
No.

223
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.190
See that Bite on?

224
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.050
Yes.

225
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.260
You're getting perfectly No,

226
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.420
I'm really I am.

227
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.530
And bring any string.

228
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.280
And now I'm on Bring no,

229
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.850
that means.

230
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.560
You know what?

231
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.750
If you under No,

232
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.950
what will happen?

233
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.210
Your user conform.

234
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.290
Variable is no no equality.

235
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:13.680
Yes,

236
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.550
no false.

237
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.730
If it is false,

238
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.150
your if is not going to exclude these lines.

239
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.070
Right?

240
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.950
So that's what we did here.

241
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.160
So no.

242
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.430
Based on some decision,

243
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:32.030
some condition you are displaying the you are executing some sort off lines.

244
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.330
No,

245
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.050
this is called conditional statement.

246
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:40.980
Your condition is going to check with help off if keyword right,

247
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.850
if he's a conditional statement,

248
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.990
right?

249
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.580
No,

250
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:44.830
let me.

251
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.170
Right.

252
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.210
Let me do the sim packs for your simple if condition.

253
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.490
So,

254
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:50.920
guys,

255
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.850
nothing is there.

256
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.820
First of all,

257
00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:04.550
if is all simple conditional statement right.

258
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:23.640
So used to control the execution off set off length corn block off court 1 may be one leg.

259
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.620
Right?

260
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.840
Then what is this index for that ive You have to write some expression here so that

261
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.620
expression may be to our false.

262
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.360
Then some statements,

263
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.280
statements means,

264
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.540
maybe Prince statement.

265
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.960
Or maybe some logic.

266
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.950
You cannot any number off statements,

267
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.820
something like that.

268
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.280
That's it.

269
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:51.880
So these two lines will execute if your expression is true and these two lines won't

270
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.650
exclude by your if condition.

271
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.990
If this expression is false not to create your expression,

272
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.730
you can use different things.

273
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.710
Different operators If you remember,

274
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.550
there are membership operators,

275
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.440
comparison operators,

276
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.220
identity operators on a logical operators on those operators,

277
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.650
final result is always true or false.

278
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.950
Now you convert any expression such that the result would be either true or false.

279
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.580
Now get your result is either true or false.

280
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:34.680
You can use combat is in operators identity membership Logical,

281
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.590
Open It does so By using these four operators,

282
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.850
you can create any expression Here.

283
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.450
Let me take one more example.

284
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.150
Let me write one more thing.

285
00:12:47.150 --> 00:13:06.770
Let me do the program name as something like Capitalize Given or let me do one thing swept

286
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.270
case.

287
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.380
Not the way So what is my requirement?

288
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:11.710
These.

289
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:18.320
I want to read a string and then I want to ask the user.

290
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.950
Do you want to convert?

291
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.710
You are string into lower or upper or swap case.

292
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.390
Whatever it may be,

293
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.020
let me take a lower case injured off this one.

294
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:44.410
Let me do one thing convert given string into lower,

295
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.100
not the way right.

296
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.610
See first of all what I'm doing is I'm reading a string from the user.

297
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.830
So let me take User Street.

298
00:13:54.830 --> 00:14:00.450
You can take any variable so to read a string You how input syntax entirely work String

299
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.050
right after reading the string.

300
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:10.420
What out is I need to ask the user Do you want to convert it into lower case?

301
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.150
Say yes or no So I'm taking user confirmation input.

302
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.650
Do you want to convert?

303
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:26.900
He was string into lower case.

304
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.150
Say yes or no.

305
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.980
That's it right?

306
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.840
No support Just assume that you are going to enter.

307
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.350
Yes,

308
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:52.110
If he says yes right then if user confirmation if it is equals to Yes then 20 were string

309
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.290
not lower.

310
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.150
That's it.

311
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.910
Fine.

312
00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.850
Let's say right.

313
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.650
Let me run you a script.

314
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.130
Why?

315
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.770
Don can work.

316
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:14.990
Let me under Indo Capital letters or combination off something like the fight on.

317
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.610
So do you want to come?

318
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.760
What?

319
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.050
He was stringing to lower case?

320
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.650
Yes.

321
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:25.800
Then you're getting old port where we help Sorry,

322
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.170
we are taking user confirmation right here You are converting user string Let me take it as

323
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:38.980
it user String user String your converting Let me read on so by tone something like this we

324
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.870
want to convert.

325
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.500
You will string in the lower case.

326
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.440
Say yes or no.

327
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:42.980
Yes,

328
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.800
I want to convert.

329
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.570
Then just type it.

330
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:44.860
Yes,

331
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.350
and end up.

332
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.850
You're getting Lord kiss.

333
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.590
No,

334
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.500
I'm really Andi.

335
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.250
And I am giving something like some data.

336
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.690
Do you want to come?

337
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:53.830
What?

338
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.170
Your string into lower case?

339
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:55.750
No,

340
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.150
the North put.

341
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.540
Because if you enter yes then the value you are going to enter?

342
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:02.930
Yes,

343
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.720
Well store in tow.

344
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:09.530
This user conform variable and that value under this three defendable we're comparing.

345
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.650
If both are equal,

346
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.590
then this result becomes true.

347
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.590
If this is true,

348
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:18.420
then this If allowed to exclude this line if it is false,

349
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.210
your if condition don't allow to exclude this land.

350
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.000
That's why you're not getting output Whenever.

351
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.750
If you say no,

352
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.600
like right.

353
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.390
So here I'm using combat is an operative.

354
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.150
Not only that,

355
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.750
let me take one more example.

356
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:39.840
Suppose I have a list off values in my hand?

357
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.150
I have a list off values,

358
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.650
right?

359
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.260
I will do one thing.

360
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.350
Even numbers from 2 to 10.

361
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.150
Right?

362
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.050
Our Joe 10.

363
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.620
Late Monday.

364
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.560
Jiro 246 eight.

365
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.290
Then then these are even numbers,

366
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.090
right?

367
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.950
So what I'm doing is I'm writing a script.

368
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.980
I'm writing this tube.

369
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.850
That's good piece,

370
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:15.350
Jake.

371
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:19.830
Available even Not be.

372
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.030
Wait,

373
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.760
something like that,

374
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.530
I think.

375
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.670
Is there my even numbers?

376
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.660
My even numbers.

377
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.350
So my even numbers I'm taking this way.

378
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.950
Right then.

379
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:38.390
What I'm doing is I'm reading some number from your input night.

380
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.260
So let me take user number equals two.

381
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.680
So there's no we are not going to read a string.

382
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.680
We're going to really number so that nobody if you're going to read a number,

383
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.880
just take eval function than inside that just right in port.

384
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.110
Entering what number?

385
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.450
Right.

386
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.100
Next.

387
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:02.820
What I'm doing is you user number in in my even numbers.

388
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.350
Then I can say praying.

389
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.070
Bring.

390
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.120
You are given.

391
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.550
Number is my even number.

392
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.990
Nothing.

393
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.910
Is that just I'm creating expression,

394
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:19.180
right?

395
00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.950
I'm creating an expression with membership operators.

396
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.050
Right.

397
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.970
Let me run this fight on.

398
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.950
Otherwise I will do one thing.

399
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.800
Type your script.

400
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.160
I'm going to run this.

401
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.280
See the output.

402
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.200
Enter your number.

403
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.050
I'm entering number called some six.

404
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.170
You're going number is my even number.

405
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:50.080
Because what are the number you are providing that is already there in my list,

406
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.070
off even numbers.

407
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.850
That's why I'm saying that is my even number.

408
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.160
Let me under Something called some 20.

409
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.620
No.

410
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.790
Good,

411
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.690
because that 20 is not there in this list.

412
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.440
That's why if you check,

413
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.230
you were user number in my even number more.

414
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.450
It is not that That's what this result is false.

415
00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:13.160
This result is false that for you're not excluding this line not to.

416
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.660
Okay,

417
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.240
So,

418
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:16.470
guys,

419
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.100
this is about a simple,

420
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.260
if conditional statement.

421
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:26.380
So the ice before working with your if conditional statements you should be good with you

422
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.160
were come back.

423
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.050
Isn't identity membership on logical operators?

424
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:39.990
Good means no Nieto learn how to use if you run any operator in your combated gin or I

425
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.050
didn't really our membership.

426
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.350
What is the result?

427
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.830
True or false?

428
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.920
How you're getting through how you're getting false.

429
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.460
That's what you have to understand if you are good with that concept that you can easily

430
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.260
understand your conditional statements.

431
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.350
Okay?

432
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.100
Okay.

433
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.550
Thank you for watching this for you.
