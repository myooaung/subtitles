1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
friends.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,760
In our previous video,

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,870
we have seen how to read a CSE file using python with the help off the fall.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,710
The model called CSP on here.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:18,120
We're going to see how to get on Lee Header instead of getting your entire data from your

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,680
CIA sweet.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,150
I mean,

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,900
instead of getting all rose from your sees me,

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,850
I want to get only the header or foster ruin us,

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,600
sees we file and then I want to see how many rules are there.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:29,910
New York,

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,220
CS.

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,550
We fight,

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,650
right?

15
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,410
Fine.

16
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,210
Let me open our previous read your script.

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:37,800
You know,

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,780
this is our previous school,

19
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,150
right?

20
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,250
So this we're using just to really worse es three file content.

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,690
So CSU is nothing but number off rows and columns.

22
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,650
You have your rows and columns in your CSB fight.

23
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,410
No,

24
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,560
I know,

25
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,610
but if you're able to see your data,

26
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,040
right,

27
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,120
that dead eyes in terms awful list.

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,690
I mean,

29
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,880
each row is one list in that way you're getting that's fine.

30
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,250
Know what I'm doing is angel off interrupt using your father Lou,

31
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,610
see that I can directly print your data.

32
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,150
We told using for loop.

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,140
See how I'm going to bring list off.

34
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,790
I'm converting your data.

35
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,950
URC sp data in realist.

36
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,490
No,

37
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,150
see the result.

38
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,590
That's it.

39
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,830
You're going to get your all rules as the one list.

40
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,250
That means inside off a list each value each row is again a list.

41
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,500
Actually,

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,050
this list were able to separate with help off your follow.

43
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,900
Right?

44
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,700
This is what we're doing with your for Luke.

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,050
You are taking one by 11 by one.

46
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:49,110
This is a This entire thing is one rule this rule were taking each each is nothing but this

47
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,380
one.

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,010
We're printing that next again we're taking this through,

49
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,050
and then we're blending there.

50
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,610
So in the know we're printing your data on,

51
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,450
we've been able to see your CSP rules.

52
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,350
Actually,

53
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,150
it is good to print your information in this way in self printing as a one list,

54
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,950
right?

55
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,990
What it is.

56
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,380
Yeah.

57
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,090
Let me come in.

58
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,390
This so it is actually good.

59
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,670
So,

60
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,270
by seeing this,

61
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,760
you can understand that this is a hey that this is the first rule.

62
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,650
This is a second room,

63
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,270
right?

64
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,330
00 Seeing should off your for loop board wearing simply were directly converting.

65
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,670
You are fight on sees the object in realist.

66
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,450
So you're getting this information now.

67
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,450
If you are there in your output,

68
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,360
that is a list which consists off each value as one row.

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,920
The foster is always ahead.

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,350
All right.

71
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
That's why what I'm doing.

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,550
You see that green?

73
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,090
The header Ease.

74
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,570
So here,

75
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,850
I want to bring to the header.

76
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,240
I want to bring to the head of burden in next line.

77
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm going to print your header.

78
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:04,050
So what is your header list off content in the in their Jiro index is they?

79
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,650
You are ahead of Let me come in this line.

80
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,480
I don't see that is a what happened.

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,250
List off.

82
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,950
Yeah.

83
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,480
Ah,

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,410
content off,

85
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,950
Joe.

86
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,050
No city after converting as a list.

87
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,840
Not no.

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:30,990
See,

89
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,550
there is a you're getting your head of This is one way,

90
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,010
right?

91
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,040
But injured off that there is one more way just to get your head are simply bring There is

92
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,950
a before the operation called Next.

93
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,650
Next.

94
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,530
See?

95
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:46,850
Actually,

96
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,740
by default the number if you open your file,

97
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,890
your cancer is there at very first operation are in the first row,

98
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,950
so next means you're simply sending your castle in your file.

99
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,350
Who next lane.

100
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,070
But before sending your Custer to next line What is there in the current line with your

101
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,210
cancer that contained?

102
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,150
We're looking ableto print with help off next to operation.

103
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,860
See that right?

104
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,400
See,

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,350
after doing this operation after doing this operation are even in order to print.

106
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,620
If you want to get your header into your hand,

107
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,550
you can print it are simply I'm doing this operation after this operation.

108
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,020
What I'm doing is I'm trying to print the rate at which is there in your content?

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,590
No,

110
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,790
you're not getting your header because already,

111
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,090
Heather,

112
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,650
we we moved our cursor from other to first row with help off this operation.

113
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,980
But while sending if you want to capture your header yes,

114
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,800
you can capture your other in this way Now in header variable,

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,230
you have a header Information off your CSB file So once If you do next operation on the

116
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:00,390
word CSP object It is going to get where the custody is their individual Your cursor is

117
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,130
there that contemptible store into your header variable.

118
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,630
You can take any wearable I'm taking her then the remaining data Whatever you have in your

119
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,080
content,

120
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,350
right?

121
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,800
So your custody is sending the next line.

122
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,850
That means you're sending your cancer toe Next rule.

123
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,950
Then you actually you hold some was for our file header Flus troll.

124
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,740
Second rule This is her That first to a second row whenever.

125
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,380
If you open your file because that is their right here in this push in your custody is

126
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,650
there.

127
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,750
Know what wearing were sending forcefully that cost are due next role.

128
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,710
That's fine.

129
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,780
Now in your content How only two rows.

130
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,250
So by using for loop,

131
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,610
you can able to get only those two rows Right now I see that if you want to get your header

132
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,090
one thing is can what?

133
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,770
You were content and be a list.

134
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,200
And then from that get index zero That is by default your header.

135
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,250
But instead of that,

136
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,550
it's very simple.

137
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,350
Header Next gunned int.

138
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,550
So how did you are getting into this variable?

139
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,650
That's it.

140
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,770
So even you don't want to do this because you need Suppose if your concentration is only on

141
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,300
header part you know it off this for you.

142
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,980
So let me bring my head.

143
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,450
Animal,

144
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:19,280
bring the head Agrees you can use any format off your prints.

145
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,950
Statement?

146
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,250
That's it you're getting.

147
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:29,550
So that is the number off Rose means after separating your head up than remaining are the

148
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,950
roost,

149
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,310
right?

150
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,050
You don't include your head as a one row and there is headed only that is not your actual

151
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,320
data,

152
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,650
right?

153
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,340
Just for header partners,

154
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,250
you are including that ruin your CSU file,

155
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,150
then remaining.

156
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,050
How many rules are that,

157
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,850
then?

158
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,090
Simply print lent off.

159
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,610
List off your content.

160
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,450
We know if you have a list in that we can calibrate how many values are there.

161
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,890
Suppose if hell three rows in a list.

162
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,650
You are getting three values as a list.

163
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,950
You are Rose.

164
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,000
That's why first time see that.

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,750
Let me print that.

166
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,290
We thought,

167
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,650
Ah,

168
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,020
this lent operation.

169
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,370
Let me print your remaining date.

170
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,410
Offer taking Heather?

171
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,960
No,

172
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,150
the remaining there days.

173
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,550
Who values inside off your main leads to see that this is a main list,

174
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,660
right?

175
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,710
So now,

176
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,270
first,

177
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,250
the list is a value that is nothing but roll one.

178
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:31,540
So I'm gonna list is a value that is nothing but wrote to so no one value second value no

179
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,940
insider for list actually have two values knife.

180
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,080
I try to a play for this lento operation.

181
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,330
We know.

182
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,320
What is the lengthy uses off Lent on your list or couple Turow's Now I can print in this

183
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,510
way The number off Rose.

184
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,660
What?

185
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,680
That's it.

186
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,610
Kudos.

187
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,230
Suppose I assume that you are not separating.

188
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,590
We're headed.

189
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,250
Let me come into your head up.

190
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,540
No,

191
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,050
the list off Rose are three.

192
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,360
Actually,

193
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,720
if you don't want to cancer the Heather header than what you are to go,

194
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,550
just subtract minus one year.

195
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,660
That's it.

196
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,590
But it's also fine.

197
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,050
You heard it under them Compton.

198
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,990
Remaining rules in your content.

199
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,880
That's fine.

200
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,960
Or if you are not reading Header,

201
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:29,210
find the number off rose in your work content then sub sect with minus one so that they're

202
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,750
going to get the number off rose in your scenes we find right.

203
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,170
So,

204
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:35,440
guys,

205
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,920
that is a simple way just to really roll header on to find the number off rules in your

206
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,310
sees.

207
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,800
We file.

208
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,360
Okay.

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,860
Okay,

210
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,190
