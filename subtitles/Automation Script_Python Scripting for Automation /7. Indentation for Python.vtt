00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
preference here.

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.550
We're going to discuss about indentation in python like let me start there.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.350
First of all,

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.170
what is an Indian?

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.670
C Inland is nothing but a space.

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.210
So this if you know,

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.550
some other languages like C c plus plus java are some shell scripts,

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.450
right?

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.490
Let's say suppose,

10
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.940
See Languish.

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.450
So in C language to represent some block off court were using curly braces.

12
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.850
Now the lanes which are there between these two caliber asses are a block.

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.750
The lines which are there between these two Carl embraces this one on this one is one block

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.910
not to represent some set off lines as X operated core as a separate block off course,

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.450
we're using curly braces there,

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.070
but in your python,

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.240
you don't have something like caliber asses to represent a block off court.

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.640
No,

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.980
Instead of that we are using here.

20
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.130
Indentations were using some space to represent a block off court.

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.740
Right?

22
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.750
So indentations are used to represent a block off course.

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.880
Right?

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.790
Let me give you a simple example.

25
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.510
So as of now,

26
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.890
I don't know about Vita,

27
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.350
but just observing some court let me write simple core.

28
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:48.180
So he had I'm opening a program.

29
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.430
A skeptical in India since uses dot The way my very first lane I am writing Simply drink.

30
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.550
This is a boat indentations,

31
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.560
right?

32
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.950
Simply or printing some string.

33
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.760
Now what I'm doing is,

34
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.750
if three greater than one,

35
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.490
then I want to exclude some two lines.

36
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.750
Print using if condition sprint,

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.300
we are taking company.

38
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.550
We are come butting three earned one.

39
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.050
That's it.

40
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.760
No guys,

41
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.910
See that I'm getting some space for these two lines Now.

42
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.750
These two lines are a block off court.

43
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.200
These two lines are a block off course on this block off court is under this line.

44
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.280
So after this line,

45
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.650
I'm giving some space equal space for all lines.

46
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.440
Then these lines,

47
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.950
even he converted 100 lines also with equal space.

48
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.510
Now all 100 lines are there under this line because after this line,

49
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.790
only we're giving spaces.

50
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.510
That's why all these lines are there under this line,

51
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.310
whatever it may be.

52
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.920
As of now,

53
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.950
I don't know about your fight on,

54
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.220
right?

55
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.050
Just observed that.

56
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.820
No,

57
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.830
These two lines are called block off court.

58
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.960
And this line is there under this line?

59
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.250
No,

60
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.210
let me save it on from this we'll study,

61
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.580
right?

62
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.930
No,

63
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.190
I'm running this against simply right on your script.

64
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.450
Name,

65
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.060
right?

66
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.980
You're getting some old put.

67
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.960
I just see once again.

68
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.590
You're cool.

69
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.620
Oh,

70
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.290
this is called indentation might.

71
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.790
No,

72
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.890
the amount off indentation is up to you,

73
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.970
but it must be consistent.

74
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.700
Troop that block.

75
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.150
See that?

76
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.590
I have given same space for first line.

77
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.300
And secondly,

78
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.750
in case by mistake,

79
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.740
if I do some extra space or some less space right on tried to run your script and see the

80
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.010
output.

81
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.200
What?

82
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:23.180
You're getting indentation error unexpected in then unnecessarily or providing some space.

83
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.250
Right?

84
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.280
So there's many.

85
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.990
But if you want to provide a space,

86
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.010
right,

87
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.360
so before that lane,

88
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.250
you should have some condition or some function in something like that.

89
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.110
As of now,

90
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.640
I don't know that we just assume that for each I never lend.

91
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.360
You should have the same space unnecessarily.

92
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.550
Don't probably space,

93
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.150
right?

94
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.310
Not only here now.

95
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.650
Let me re check it first.

96
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.480
I'm running.

97
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.310
It's working.

98
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.150
Know what I'm doing is for very first line.

99
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.810
I'm going to provide a space.

100
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.330
Very first.

101
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.080
Let me some prince statement for that.

102
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.250
I'm giving some space.

103
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.680
If I give some space.

104
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.450
And if I run after that,

105
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:08.240
you are getting in a letter like again indentation era unexpected and then unnecessarily or

106
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.220
providing a space for line number one.

107
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.310
Right?

108
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.820
So to provide some space before starting your line Right before that lane usually are some

109
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.300
logic that logical like with the condition or some function name or some class name

110
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.150
something like that.

111
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.460
Like let me open.

112
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.480
You escape Very first line.

113
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.150
I'm starting.

114
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.080
If it is very first line possible,

115
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.350
you should not provide any space.

116
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.510
Let me deliver space even let me do one thing.

117
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.490
No,

118
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.250
forget about the were block off court.

119
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.830
Now I'm writing something here.

120
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.250
Print.

121
00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:01.860
We are okay with it and then they sense not for this prince straight man,

122
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.660
right?

123
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.450
If I right some space,

124
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.540
then you're fighting wound.

125
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.140
Except in case If this line is under this line I mean under this block off court.

126
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.350
Then for this line you have to provide same slant off space.

127
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:25.310
But we are providing only one space In case if this line is also under this block,

128
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.150
many 100 probably same space here.

129
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.710
But my assumption is there is no relation between this block off or on this line on disease

130
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.710
.

131
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.050
I'm assuming this is a separate line.

132
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.970
If this is a separate line,

133
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.750
you should not probably space first.

134
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.480
If you want to privatise space before this land you hard right against something like some

135
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.040
condition,

136
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.250
name some condition or some function name or some class name,

137
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.750
Right.

138
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.350
So as off.

139
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.650
No,

140
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.410
we don't have anything like condition.

141
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.890
Function on the classes.

142
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.330
Don't Probably space.

143
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.750
That's it.

144
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.240
So simply guys,

145
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.490
as a learner don't provide any space before starting your line.

146
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.820
Okay,

147
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.450
That is nothing.

148
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.350
But simply about your indentations off your fight on,

149
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.380
that's it.

150
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.450
Now it's working perfectly.

151
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.240
So his final point.

152
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.750
Just remember that this is very important.

153
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.250
Don't include on Indian unnecessarily night.

154
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.390
Okay.

155
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.770
Okay,

156
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.980
guys,

157
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.890
Thank you for watching this.

158
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.250
Will you
