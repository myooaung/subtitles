1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
prince in this video,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,740
we're going toe.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,160
See how to provide input for your pie Transcript.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,950
Wild running.

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,020
I'm how to provide output from your by transcript.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,450
And also we're going to see the uses off a malfunction.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,580
Right.

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,160
So this year I'm explaining this concert from my Lennox books.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,890
I'm opening my Atlantic Stedman right from there.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm going to explain about this.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,330
And you can also try the same thing.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,030
Whatever I'm trained from UNIX or UNIX,

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,260
like systems or Lennox even on your windows as well.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,240
Without any change,

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,600
the only thing on our windows we configured fight on us simply python.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,150
But the year fight on is like fight on three name,

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,650
right?

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,770
Fine.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,650
Let me write simply a skeptical input and output script Not be Wait.

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,810
So,

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,040
guys,

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm going to design a simple ah Palatinate.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,820
Artemis.

24
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,430
Caligula.

25
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,870
So simple are my dick calculator.

26
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,450
So I'm fixing numbers like a close to And because toe right then I am finding the result

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:18,250
equals two year plus B and I'm going toe print the early shelf.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,650
Yeah,

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,170
I be He's so here.

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,850
I'm going to print my result.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,250
Fine.

32
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,600
So this is our script.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,490
Whatever we have now I'm going toe printed The result with the help off.

34
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,250
Bite on tree not with So if you see simply pipe down then it will work from fight on two.

35
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,790
Invite on to your own.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,700
How like this syntax you have four matters string you don't now only invite on treaties

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:56,690
there so piped on three Input Dando It's working perfectly But if you observe our script is

38
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,520
like simple automatic calculator are simply addition Collect me you only option as edition

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,790
Simple addition calculator because I'm not being here as off No addition Subtraction,

40
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,650
multiplication and division Let me does only simply tradition,

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,790
right?

42
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,520
So what?

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,270
That would just give you how as off Now that script,

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,350
If you run with any number of times Europe would would be always 12 for foreign eight,

45
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,850
right?

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:31,690
But my requirement is if it is an addition calculator while running in this way our

47
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,000
stripper has to our skin dirty or so and so number Enter your B number and then it has to

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,450
do the result Each time it has to ask each time it has to take two numbers.

49
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,450
Then it has toe find the desert.

50
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,320
But as I know we are fixing our values year and being set off your script,

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,670
but I don't want to ruin their.

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,180
Then what I can do is insure coffee a close to four.

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,810
Always.

54
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,560
I'm going to read my number from command line so far that this is a syntax and reevaluate.

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,650
So whatever you're writing inside off your input parents is in in terms off quotations that

56
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,850
will be printed as thes on you're Come on line.

57
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:16,850
Then let me take even for we also input and that be value,

58
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,750
right?

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,840
So as off No,

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm not going to perform.

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,280
You were a desert because I want to show you something.

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Drink.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:36,480
The value for years is Yeah,

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,470
I It's a type ease.

65
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,190
I mean,

66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,270
what is the data type?

67
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,280
I want to print that.

68
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,190
So type off you want to you,

69
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,650
right?

70
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,280
Let me check it.

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,230
You can check you in for B.

72
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,570
Also,

73
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,300
I'm taking only four by tone.

74
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,550
Sorry Spell Mystic.

75
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,730
Be white.

76
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,550
The it Julian.

77
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,050
Something wrong?

78
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,350
Where is it?

79
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,850
I puffy bring Okay.

80
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,600
Sorry.

81
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,740
We're using Python.

82
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,070
It's not fight on fight on three because we're working with fight on three fortune only.

83
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,080
Invite on three abortion.

84
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,790
We help.

85
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,400
You have for a month or two strings.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,850
Okay.

87
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,960
See that?

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,380
Yeah.

89
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,020
Before that,

90
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,700
let me show you.

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,120
You are script ones.

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,450
So this is your school,

93
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,800
you know,

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,730
But not if you're on your bike landscape.

95
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,150
It will run from up to down on while running.

96
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,230
If any line started with Hashim on that line won't exclude.

97
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,360
Same plate will skip.

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,250
Now you have only three lines in your program.

99
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,840
These two on this line.

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,890
So because off a cause to input first you're skeptical.

101
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,530
Take input with this command some value from common land.

102
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,630
Let me enter some value.

103
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,250
45 on some be value,

104
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,260
then see the output.

105
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,650
You're getting value 45 like a string.

106
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,950
But you know,

107
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,340
that is a number.

108
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
We want to feel that as a number.

109
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,800
But your bite on three is taking with help off in port,

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,400
right,

111
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,250
that as this string.

112
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,890
So what are the input?

113
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,510
Your programming.

114
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,950
That is always a string if you're really that with help off input.

115
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,880
Right?

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,390
But that hasn't fight on to you.

117
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,080
How Input to read numbers.

118
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Anyhow,

119
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,950
Ryan put to read strings.

120
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:31,300
But a year there is a common common inputs is their common input statement.

121
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,280
Is there that is input through which water you are reading from common line.

122
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,750
That is always the string.

123
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,250
Then how you can convert to your required that a type?

124
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,060
We are different things.

125
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,190
I'm in different types.

126
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,960
Let me weapon my fight on three.

127
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,900
Colonel graze Whatever we're going to discuss now that will work only with by country,

128
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,450
not with bite onto Let's X equals two input.

129
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,470
Right and bricks.

130
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,670
So I went Bring something.

131
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,310
What happened?

132
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,680
Yeah,

133
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,190
I started with single condition and nervous Double collection.

134
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,750
That's wrong.

135
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,730
And medics,

136
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,150
I'm ending something gold for physics.

137
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:20,050
Like then See that Taipa fix strength.

138
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,440
But I want to feel that as a number in teacher.

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
So that's why wild reading,

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,850
you know,

141
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,670
type conversion.

142
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,150
We help tonight.

143
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,650
So simply you can write in this way.

144
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,860
Read on then.

145
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,360
Cannot in does in Dijon.

146
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,550
This is one way.

147
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,490
So what?

148
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,120
There Whatever you are entering from your common line something wrong.

149
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,790
Indentation.

150
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,280
Yeah,

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,290
Noble read something and can work that into invasion.

152
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,800
No.

153
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,130
See that print pipe off your ex in visa write articles,

154
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,730
You know,

155
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,650
one more the fold function cause called evolution.

156
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,360
Using this,

157
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
based on whatever the data you are entering,

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
your python will identify what I posted that you are entering.

159
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,530
Let me under some three,

160
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,150
not four,

161
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,280
right?

162
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:36,520
No printed type of fix float so a violation function will automatically come.

163
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,710
What?

164
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,650
You're given their timeto Portland data type.

165
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,490
Anyway,

166
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,250
input is only two red strings.

167
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,770
But if you want to read some other values,

168
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,750
you hard to use evaluation.

169
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,150
Right?

170
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,050
Fine.

171
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,050
Let me do one thing.

172
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,680
I'm going to repeat same input and then six No,

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,450
I'm going to Endor a string call height,

174
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,750
right?

175
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,550
Si hai is not defined.

176
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,050
It is not taking So when nobody If you're using evaluation,

177
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,030
I never know if you are providing a string anybody fall input.

178
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,310
These here is really to read is a tow string.

179
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,150
But but nobody.

180
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,890
If you're using evaluation,

181
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:31,510
you had to bribe radio string as a quotations not to no Bring Taipa fix.

182
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,250
That's it.

183
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,150
Okay,

184
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,420
so me Dia use X equals two a well input.

185
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,540
Enter your required thing on whenever If you're entranced ring me.

186
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,680
Please provide in terms off quotations other ways.

187
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,350
If you want to read only strings simply use this one.

188
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,440
Enter your string and in this case,

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,380
you know need to provide anything inside off.

190
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,860
Your quotation simply can buy.

191
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,530
Hi.

192
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,350
Hello.

193
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,150
That's it.

194
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,450
Tonight.

195
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,970
No See Print.

196
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,950
Exe It will work.

197
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,270
So whenever refuse evaluation function for you were in port then you are to write your

198
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,910
condition inside off double quotes like Okay,

199
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,550
now let me design your simple calculator.

200
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:35,650
So input you have all relation.

201
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,070
Okay.

202
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,300
These are syntax to really your numbers.

203
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,590
Of course,

204
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,290
you can also use type conversion but I'm using this one.

205
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,750
These,

206
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,350
of course,

207
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,980
somewhat better.

208
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,990
I will tell you that as well,

209
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,400
guys.

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,810
So first of all,

211
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,040
Abdul,

212
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,530
your script you're having now this may number of lines 12345 Because our first line,

213
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,850
if I run my pythons kept with fight on three right?

214
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,990
Because our first line it is reading something.

215
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,910
Second line it is reading something.

216
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,490
Then you're getting addition Eight on type is in danger for your year.

217
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,800
Even be is also same,

218
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,980
right?

219
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,210
So same program.

220
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,750
You can also write in this way without any confusion.

221
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,550
Let me come and forced all these lines.

222
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:33,690
So what I'm doing is Yeah,

223
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,750
because to in Asia,

224
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,450
but this in tax will work only to read Indian numbers.

225
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,510
But you may anybody in Egypt Oh,

226
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,680
right.

227
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,150
Some floor.

228
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,990
Or maybe some complex sometimes.

229
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:57,350
So that we don't prefer this one night.

230
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,970
So I don't prefer this,

231
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,300
actually.

232
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
But just the reason.

233
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,930
One more option in games.

234
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,850
If you want to walk purely with indigenous,

235
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,360
right,

236
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,190
then at that time,

237
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,150
you can take this one.

238
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,550
But by using evolution automatically,

239
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,120
it will identify you.

240
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,850
What are the data you are and bring right?

241
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,720
So I'm wondering for if I see that mine.

242
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,750
Indeed it.

243
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:28,390
But if we enter something like find out seven I,

244
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:36,500
it is not accepting because it it need only in digital values.

245
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,890
Right?

246
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,700
But if I use simply with evaluation,

247
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,750
it will work perfectly.

248
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,550
So that's the reason.

249
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,340
If you want to read anything from command line,

250
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,140
just try to use a valuation off your input on out of that time.

251
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,960
In case if you want to provide any strings,

252
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,580
he hard to write your strings in terms off conditions,

253
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,240
but anywhere's off.

254
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,730
Now we're going to work with the numbers on the Let me take for that fight a nine dart,

255
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,700
some to see the result.

256
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,750
It's working perfectly.

257
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,940
So that's why guys the his my station tried to use because we're going for anywhere.

258
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,280
Definitely.

259
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,460
All our names will use bite on three only.

260
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:16,980
That's why.

261
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,190
Just try to remember in this way to read inputs.

262
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,550
Okay.

263
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,210
Okay.

264
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,850
Thank you for watching this video.
