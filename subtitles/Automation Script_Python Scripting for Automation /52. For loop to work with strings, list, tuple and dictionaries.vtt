ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
friends here.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.050
We're going to use your for you for your strings list.

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.950
Couple's on big studies.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.480
Already we have seen how to use your loo for string list a couple.

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.300
Right?

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.950
But here,

7
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.360
I want to show you once again a bit.

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.790
Small modifications,

9
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.150
right?

10
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.930
Anyway,

11
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.850
there is no modification with your strength.

12
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.110
Let me write a simple by timescale.

13
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.260
Just Tokyo Worrell idea with your for loop to use for your different data structures and

14
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.950
later types.

15
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.250
Let me take loops for data.

16
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.260
Something like you can take any script name,

17
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.510
right?

18
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.140
Structures,

19
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.760
start freeway.

20
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.590
First of all,

21
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:55.870
let me take my stringers Anything my string working with for you apparently can print your

22
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.250
strength.

23
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.390
Right?

24
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.550
You can get your output.

25
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.350
Let me write my strength.

26
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.180
You're getting your output now I want to print They were strenght characters,

27
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.310
one by one in different lanes.

28
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.600
Actually,

29
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.680
I want to print I mean,

30
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.600
suppose in first line.

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.900
I want to get first character,

32
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.650
Second line second out of something like that,

33
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.050
right?

34
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.440
See what I'm doing?

35
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.950
You simply for each character.

36
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.320
Aiken separate character one by one,

37
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.620
from your given strain with help off.

38
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.640
You're Luke for Luke.

39
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.250
By default.

40
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.950
You can use it.

41
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.550
Yes.

42
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.350
You're getting one by one character.

43
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.010
Now,

44
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.010
you remember each of these two lines in case you for your intensive just to print a word

45
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.250
character one by one Characters,

46
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.560
right?

47
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.160
Not to be used for Lou for your strings.

48
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.650
You how joint matter?

49
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.850
If you remember join,

50
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.540
let me write.

51
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.210
Forced us string as it is and see the output what you're getting.

52
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.220
We're getting your string by adding space.

53
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.250
But I'm going to hurt slash your new line.

54
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.150
No seat output.

55
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.120
No,

56
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.560
I did write two lines off our port toe.

57
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.750
Bring your characters line by line,

58
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.450
right?

59
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.980
Just you can use join Mature night.

60
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.070
Fine then let me come in.

61
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.750
This there is no much work with you are strings.

62
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.670
In case if you want to simply print your characters one by one on your site,

63
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.750
you can together print.

64
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.420
I'm in for loop or giant directly.

65
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.740
That's okay.

66
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.650
You know what I'm doing is let me take my list.

67
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.350
I am writing 12345 Something like that.

68
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.960
Now you know how to dig.

69
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.850
You are each value from your list one by one,

70
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.150
honey can print it right?

71
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.530
Yes.

72
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.740
After your or put,

73
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm able to print your wireless one by one.

74
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.800
That's fine.

75
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800
But I assume that inside off,

76
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.280
at least on how a values us.

77
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.650
Okay,

78
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.350
let me give this oddities.

79
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.850
I want to come in this.

80
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.850
That's fine.

81
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.130
No,

82
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.510
actually,

83
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.740
no.

84
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.620
My listed in this way,

85
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.130
guys.

86
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.650
My list a close to list off list.

87
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.740
But each and every value is again a couple.

88
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.130
Yes,

89
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.020
you may have in this way.

90
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.650
No problem.

91
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.590
Something like this.

92
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.750
Now for this I'm using.

93
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.580
Now this is not like a one value.

94
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.570
It is like some items,

95
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.750
right?

96
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.110
I mean,

97
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.750
for each topple inside off a list I'm taking simply even take any variable.

98
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.950
I'm taking simply each item in your my list.

99
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.990
No,

100
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.250
I'm printing each item.

101
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.950
No seed output.

102
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.830
Yeah,

103
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.660
let me save it and see the output from your list.

104
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.970
This entire thing is actually one first value.

105
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.890
That's what I'm taking.

106
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.950
Each item is nothing but first value you're taking.

107
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.480
Then you're printing second.

108
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.570
Will you see?

109
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.550
Finally,

110
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.380
this entire thing is a first value in your list like one This entire valley with second

111
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.850
will you start of a loo.

112
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.690
Now you're taking one by one on your printing.

113
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.050
Them?

114
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.470
Yes,

115
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.510
we're doing that now.

116
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.250
One more thing.

117
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.490
Let me open my common line.

118
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.990
It's very important by doing this time,

119
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.520
You guys,

120
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.680
I have a couple called some number.

121
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.950
Maybe in this way.

122
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.000
And I'm going to assign this like X.

123
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.650
Come away,

124
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.200
goes to and print your way and see the result would you?

125
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.520
How you're going to get six on any X?

126
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.550
We are going to get fight.

127
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.150
No,

128
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.710
What I'm doing here is with help off your for lewd this entire thing I'm storing into each

129
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.980
item,

130
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.450
variable.

131
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.070
I'm going to store this.

132
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.610
First of all,

133
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.210
you into this each item that I'm bringing the second value.

134
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.370
Then I'm bringing third value.

135
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.050
I'm taking on that.

136
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.500
I'm printing with help off your look.

137
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.350
But while taking here because we have approval is in the inside off this couple,

138
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.750
I can unpack it with two variables.

139
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.270
I mean,

140
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.640
see,

141
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.940
I'm taking something like first value and then second Well,

142
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.050
Afghan bias,

143
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.250
no one I'm doing is I'm going to print only off.

144
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.570
I'm going to print only if that means from each and every item I am taking first value

145
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.650
other than I am printing there.

146
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.110
Actually,

147
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.290
I am taking to values.

148
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.060
But first value oneness.

149
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.740
I'm ascending.

150
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.880
BF so I mustn't be Yes,

151
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.620
but I am bringing only if that's what.

152
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.930
What is that what you're going to expertise from first item one from here for from here?

153
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.450
Six.

154
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.170
See that put?

155
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.150
Let me run it by saving this court.

156
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.250
One second.

157
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.600
One second.

158
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.950
Yeah.

159
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.980
Let me save it on.

160
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.480
Bernie said output 146 year getting only first values.

161
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.750
Now I'm bringing Yes,

162
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.470
no.

163
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.350
In each and every item you're going to get second value.

164
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.160
I want to print both.

165
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.550
Yes,

166
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.090
you can print it.

167
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.670
No problem.

168
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.150
You have come.

169
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.200
Oh,

170
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.610
yes,

171
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.960
One grandma do.

172
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.350
I'm in 1 to 456 only you're getting one and two.

173
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.930
I mean,

174
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.960
why I have taken value from your list if that,

175
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.410
I believe,

176
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.650
is a couple or maybe a list Also,

177
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.710
that you can unpack it in tow.

178
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.500
Two variables.

179
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.710
Let me take now instead of a couple.

180
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.350
I can also take inside off a list,

181
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.650
a list,

182
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.840
or maybe combination off your list on double salts.

183
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.350
Noble.

184
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.220
But the thing is,

185
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.590
whenever if you're taking two variables inside off your loop,

186
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.790
the value which you're taking from your list that really should have two values,

187
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.400
then only you can unpack it first.

188
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.160
The value 2 45 2nd Valuable.

189
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.670
Yes,

190
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.150
that's it.

191
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.980
But see,

192
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.380
they're supposed if I have a list Edmund digging.

193
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.970
Take a more for its fine.

194
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.650
But if I don't have only if I have one value,

195
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.530
you can turn back it because X come away.

196
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.910
Costa.

197
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.760
We are assigning one.

198
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.950
Well,

199
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.810
that's not possible.

200
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.650
Exit Coastal where Coastal You can say it.

201
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.490
Three.

202
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.930
Value.

203
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.770
Canton back.

204
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.050
It took two variables.

205
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.500
That's what I'm seeing here.

206
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.600
And what if you're taking one by one?

207
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.220
We leave,

208
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.480
though.

209
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.380
If you have to lose inside of that value,

210
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.720
you can unpack in terms off.

211
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.450
Two variables.

212
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.270
No,

213
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.820
see the result.

214
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.460
I'm saving it.

215
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.010
I'm running it.

216
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.240
Yes,

217
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.350
you're getting the same way.

218
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.570
You can write couple on insider for trouble.

219
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.520
You can take a couple also combination off couples and lists.

220
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.110
You can take anything actually,

221
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.760
upto this.

222
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.870
It's not that much important,

223
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.450
but the concept is important.

224
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.250
Why I am giving this is you have one very,

225
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.150
very important situation.

226
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.050
While working with your real time using dictionaries.

227
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.980
First off,

228
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.350
let me define my dictionary.

229
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.610
I'm dating suppose here.

230
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.950
I'm writing one.

231
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.380
Then be I'm writing some to let me take anything.

232
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.550
You can take it right?

233
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.850
GSC on value history?

234
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.790
Nothing.

235
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.310
No,

236
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.950
I'm taking for each in your my dictionary.

237
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.120
Let me print.

238
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.970
You can guess me.

239
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.640
Are you gonna Can you expect me?

240
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.100
What is that?

241
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.150
But I'm going to get if I run the score,

242
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:33.290
only keys you're going to get biting for If this is your dick study if you use your

243
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:40.430
dictionary inside off your look you're going to get only keys are if you remember,

244
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.850
one of the dictionary operation is like darkies is also there.

245
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:49.370
That is a list Any way you could take only my Dexter.

246
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.530
Your dictionary in your loop by the fall,

247
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.950
they will look for look is going to take only kiss.

248
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.110
Otherwise your dictionary dot keys operation.

249
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.150
It's very,

250
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:05.350
very important case Let me don't even see that put you're going to get kiss only.

251
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.980
But I want to get only values now.

252
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.520
You cannot play here values now see the result?

253
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.480
You're going to get 123 values now I want to get key and then value If you remember,

254
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.850
there is operation called Items on your big study Not see the result.

255
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.450
Each is nothing.

256
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.630
But now I don't which consist off key on value,

257
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.560
key and value because no In each and every variable you have a couple which consists off

258
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.230
two values.

259
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.750
Now I can take here two variables called key come a value.

260
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.120
I mean you can take any variable name but because this is Dick Sorry from the history

261
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.750
you're getting key and then value Now I'm taking key and value.

262
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.350
Now if you want to print only kiss you can print it on Li Ke.

263
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.640
See,

264
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.290
that would put But I want to print only value.

265
00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:03.680
So that would put I want to get both Kik a mobile.

266
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.210
Yes,

267
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.750
nothing.

268
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:12.540
So taking keys and values from your dictionary using for loop is very,

269
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.250
very important,

270
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.930
right?

271
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:19.250
To exclude this logic again and again and see the result with all operations,

272
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.410
this is very,

273
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.350
very important place.

274
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.850
Working with your dictionary with the daughter items on What is the output are getting?

275
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.530
See if I run simply on my common line,

276
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.560
you have already dictionary What is our put off items?

277
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.260
You're going to get their list,

278
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.550
which consists off.

279
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.170
Apple has a value on in the couple.

280
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.450
You how one is a key and second value is the value.

281
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.710
No using for loop,

282
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:51.100
you can take one by one value from your loop and while taking because you have it toppled,

283
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.400
which consist off to lose.

284
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.620
Now I'm tryingto unpack in this way X,

285
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.610
come away cause to fight.

286
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.860
Come on,

287
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.150
six,

288
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.450
You know.

289
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.980
So now what?

290
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.290
I'm taking you stick a more value.

291
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.150
I'm digging because it's very suitable word for your dictionary.

292
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.330
This is a key,

293
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.050
and this is a valid.

294
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:04.680
That's what I'm taking.

295
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.100
Variable.

296
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.200
Starsky and Value.

297
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.050
Right.

298
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.220
Okay.

299
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.690
Okay.

300
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.350
I thank you for watching this video.
