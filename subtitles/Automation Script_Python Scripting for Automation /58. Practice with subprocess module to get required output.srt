1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910
prince here.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,850
We're going to write a simple by transcript with your so process model.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,350
The requirement is find bash washing off planet ways.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,550
See if I take my Lennox Warriors sort Colonel,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,050
you know you have a bash on your body.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,260
Next,

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,650
like systems are different.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,000
Bash,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,260
iPhone,

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,950
iPhone washing your getting some more put.

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,060
But here's what I need.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,540
I need this value only full auto out for six.

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,050
That is actually my washing my bash wash.

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,350
And I need that output only I don't want entire output.

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,010
See,

16
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,150
Before going to run your command with your python,

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,750
you are so think about your requirement.

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,850
I mean,

19
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,780
whether you want to run simply your common or you also need some modifications on your old

20
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,070
put if you want to run simply your command,

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,660
then just to go on use waste our system.

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,650
That is very simple one but on the output if you need some modifications as off No,

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,360
see that we need to get this output from this.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,080
We want only this four door to door for six.

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,960
That means we need some modifications on your own.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,250
Put.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,230
That's why I just go on,

28
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,250
run your command using so process model.

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,460
Right?

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:12,860
See,

31
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,100
now I'm going to write a python.

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,430
Skip,

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,410
just toe,

34
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,260
get bashed.

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,100
Washington Bias Washington B Y Yes.

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,110
I'm going to import some process model.

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,280
See,

38
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,050
before going to right there were bite landscapes using so process,

39
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,810
right?

40
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,190
You just keep in your hand.

41
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,260
This document only We heard that from a previous video for timing,

42
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,740
bedlam,

43
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,000
coping this our line.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,930
But you people don't copy and face the court here.

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,820
You just try to light type your core.

46
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,450
So that will.

47
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,070
Italy.

48
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,620
It is easy,

49
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,030
toe.

50
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,250
Remember your core,

51
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,050
right?

52
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,870
Your sin.

53
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,080
Taxes for yourself.

54
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,650
Process?

55
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,420
No,

56
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,760
actually.

57
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,400
Bashes space hyphenation,

58
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,840
iPhone,

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,040
iPhone.

60
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,940
Abortion command is not depending on any environment.

61
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,400
Variables.

62
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,120
That's why I can take simply command because to false Sorry.

63
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,320
I mean,

64
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,450
Sally closed toe falls.

65
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,800
If I take Shelly Coastal Falls,

66
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,350
you know you have to take your command as a list.

67
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,330
So bash hyphen,

68
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,230
iPhone Washington.

69
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,920
So how could get their command as a list means once again,

70
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm feeling that Just go to your bite on tunnel.

71
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,010
Take your windows.

72
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,250
Common as thirties.

73
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,230
I mean window.

74
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,530
Sorry.

75
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:20,760
Next.

76
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,470
Like systems then.

77
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,150
I just played this in this way.

78
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,910
Then you're getting some more port.

79
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,380
That is nothing.

80
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,540
What?

81
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,780
You were a list for silicones,

82
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,550
Toe falls.

83
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,780
That's what I'm doing here directly.

84
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,660
Because as off no,

85
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,430
I know the require thing.

86
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,230
So that's what exactly?

87
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,750
I'm ready.

88
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,740
Bash.

89
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,320
I have my phone.

90
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,250
Wasn't as a list.

91
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,850
Fine.

92
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,770
After running your common right,

93
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,480
it may take some time to exclude your common anywhere.

94
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
Bash space,

95
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,760
hyphen,

96
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,430
iPhone Washing is very simple command.

97
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,690
It won't take any Ah,

98
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,480
much time.

99
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,770
You need to wait.

100
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,850
But it is a better practice to use.

101
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,390
Yes,

102
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,310
but not wait.

103
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,590
Because sometimes whenever we were going to use some such command it would take some time

104
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,680
to exclude your commands.

105
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,990
That so I just tried to make a habit that using SP not wait in your court.

106
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,750
Then find out your output on ETA.

107
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,850
So you know how to get your output on them simply by communicating with the world.

108
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,100
SB that's it.

109
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,040
No,

110
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,780
guys see,

111
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,990
Based on our secret,

112
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,350
I can say that where your command was success or fail,

113
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,250
right?

114
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,310
Let me do one thing.

115
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,140
If r c if it is equals to Jiro,

116
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:39,730
then I consider strongly I can say bring Oh,

117
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,310
please.

118
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,750
So it is old put.

119
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,190
Oh,

120
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,180
that is available.

121
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,910
You are taken else means if our sick or is not a coastal settlements.

122
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,740
There was a failure,

123
00:03:48,740 --> 00:04:02,320
so common was fade Return error Banana are Natalee's so are easy.

124
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,250
We are We are taking what you can take any wearable like let me say this and run the court

125
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,250
.

126
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,010
Let me run this with by country.

127
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,850
We need my country,

128
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,150
Right,

129
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,270
right.

130
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,770
You're getting your output right on.

131
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,650
What I'm doing is I'm going to take a invalid command in trough.

132
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,940
You're bash iPhone,

133
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,190
iPhone.

134
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,450
Watch any fire in high fun bash Washington.

135
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,160
You're getting an invalid syntax.

136
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,540
I mean,

137
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,230
common is not excluding probably.

138
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,450
Right.

139
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,500
That is actually not a valid command.

140
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,790
So that's why what I'm doing is just I'm taking your list of basses,

141
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,220
then injured off hyphen iPhone Washington I'm taking You should not take just to show that

142
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,280
whether our court is working properly or not.

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,650
For that I am taking this one.

144
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,850
Let me show your court ones and then let me run your core.

145
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,650
See?

146
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,760
Common was failed on an Aries bash washing no such fire territory.

147
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
So something wrong with your comer.

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,170
So we know that what is all wrong here,

149
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,730
That's why.

150
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,200
Be careful whenever if you're taking your comments.

151
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,900
So same command.

152
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,350
You can also run by using Shelley Coast.

153
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,790
True,

154
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,560
by simply taking your command as a string but on windows,

155
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
please prefer Shelly Coastal.

156
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,350
True always.

157
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,250
Okay,

158
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,150
Plane.

159
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,530
So they says off.

160
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:23,890
No,

161
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,580
you are getting your output with your fight on.

162
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,600
But requirement is I don't want to get this entire output right.

163
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,750
I need only this one.

164
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,490
That's why what I'm doing is,

165
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,050
first of all,

166
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,930
I'm going to come What?

167
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,310
Your entire output into a list.

168
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,760
You can convert your output,

169
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,650
which is ah,

170
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,520
from your SP,

171
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,230
right.

172
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,520
Split the lines by using that.

173
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,050
Even get Europa has at least to see that you're getting as a list right now.

174
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,870
What I'm doing is I'm going to print your line one by one.

175
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,710
Just observe the logic so I don't want to print in this way.

176
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,750
What I'm doing is I'm taking one by one all value from your list which has been created

177
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:15,020
from your out port simply for each line in your output,

178
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,320
nor speak lines simply.

179
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,550
I'm bringing each line.

180
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,680
See that?

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,610
See the logic,

182
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,280
right?

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,980
The same way.

184
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,910
Just practice it gay.

185
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,450
So that it will be easy for you to understand this court.

186
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,490
Yes,

187
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,990
I get your getting your entire output.

188
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,990
But I want to print the lines which are having only wash in.

189
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,350
Not simple.

190
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:46,110
See that what I'm doing is if Washington,

191
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,150
in line in your each line,

192
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,750
then only printed that line otherwise don't create their line.

193
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,760
No.

194
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,420
See the logic.

195
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,630
What?

196
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,850
You're going to get your or put?

197
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:03,810
Yes.

198
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,950
You're getting these two lines,

199
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,810
right?

200
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,280
But what you need you need first liners off.

201
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,400
No,

202
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,770
right.

203
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,250
I'm in Washington.

204
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,100
So as off.

205
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,540
No,

206
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,610
you don't know that X concept?

207
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:18,840
What?

208
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,500
We leave?

209
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,770
Yeah.

210
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,780
Based on release,

211
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,940
I will take if Washington under lease Both words are there in a given line.

212
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,150
Then all I want to print that.

213
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,810
See,

214
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,500
guys,

215
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm going to use now.

216
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,100
Here one You are logical operator called on if Washington each line on them.

217
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:45,860
Release Washington as well as really what I should have in my line then Only I want to

218
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,590
print that line.

219
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,350
There is you need to understand about logical overturned when you're to take on the means.

220
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,170
See,

221
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,470
my requirement is this thing should be true.

222
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,450
This thing should be true.

223
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,940
Whenever these two are true,

224
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,980
Are there time only?

225
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,610
I want to exclude my condition.

226
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,750
So in that case,

227
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,680
you know toe club your two conditions with help off under operator.

228
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,040
So if both are true,

229
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,450
then only your final result will be true if use under operator.

230
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,450
But if you take all over to know you're going to get again two lines,

231
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,650
you just take it so that you can understand.

232
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,930
Now let me Ronnie Transit output.

233
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,560
Now you're getting only one line,

234
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,050
which is having Russian as well as release.

235
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,550
But I need this part,

236
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,870
right?

237
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,800
I need this part.

238
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,050
So what I'm doing is nice As of now,

239
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,350
I don't know about rogue ex.

240
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,250
That's why I'm doing so many steps later,

241
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,230
we will see again with the reggae X factor.

242
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,820
Very simple as off.

243
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,050
No,

244
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,190
don't concentrate on break.

245
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,440
It's just see the logic.

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,550
What I'm doing Night.

247
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:53,410
So now 1234 to part You are getting as I mean indexed for easy or required out.

248
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,250
Put us off now.

249
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,250
Let me take this from this.

250
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,150
I'm taking index three value not to.

251
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,980
But I eat only four door to door for six.

252
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,390
Then again,

253
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,600
split this with help off this parenthesis.

254
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,540
See that?

255
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,480
What I'm doing is again I'm splitting.

256
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,800
You are out Port base.

257
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,170
Wrong.

258
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,150
This parent assists symbol Where is it?

259
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,150
That's it.

260
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:34,960
Under that I'm taking Index digital just to see first we thought this one what is all

261
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,930
pretty or gdi If I split that our port with tell preferences what we're getting You're

262
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,040
getting a list which consisted of food or to write for six under.

263
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,080
Then second value is something but I need this.

264
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,320
Well,

265
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,890
that's why just taken x Eljero.

266
00:09:52,890 --> 00:10:01,600
Let me write that index digital.

267
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,020
So this is the final requirement through which you're going to get your bash wash and fold

268
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,090
or corrupt for six night.

269
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,200
So that is successfully we implemented a cold Ah,

270
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,450
accord Call getting bashed washing using fight on on your index like systems.

271
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,950
Right?

272
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,390
So,

273
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:22,800
guys,

274
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,410
there's not that much important.

275
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:30,050
But the thing is how you were using your so process for your requirement that is important

276
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,050
.

277
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,850
Getting bashed washing is not the important thing,

278
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,780
right?

279
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,650
How you are implementing your UNIX.

280
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,310
Come on,

281
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,250
get your bash.

282
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,540
Washington using your fight on that is important.

283
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,750
So that's why I was given this example,

284
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,750
right?

285
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,500
No.

286
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,960
Before going to the next video,

287
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,560
Please,

288
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,650
please try to find job awash in using your fight on.

289
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,840
Yeah,

290
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,090
for job for you to take only one high fun,

right?

292
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,560
If you run your core,

293
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,590
I need to get only $1 are not Jiro underscore to double one.

294
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,750
So before going to next video,

295
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,450
please please try to implement by yourselves this output.

296
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:17,140
I don't know if I run If I provide this command for myself process I mean for my bite on

297
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,360
Skip.

298
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,710
I need to get a washing as wonders on or Jiro underscore to double one.

299
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,650
I just I'm giving one clue.

300
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,080

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,390
So before coming the next video,

309
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,650
please try to implement the core.

310
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,620
Get your Java Washington using your python by excluding your command with help off.

311
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,600
So process model.

312
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,250
