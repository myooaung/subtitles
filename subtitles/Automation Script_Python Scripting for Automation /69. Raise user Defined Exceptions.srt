1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
prints here,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,550
we're going to see how to create custom exceptions.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,180
First of all,

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,310
what is a custom exception symbol wanted?

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:13,590
Lee.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,750
If you want to rise an exception,

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,550
then you can rise so that type of acceptance or called custom exceptions.

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,690
And you can create this custom exceptions in two ways.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,650
By using rising asset.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:38,330
So rise we're going to use our rising it exceptions,

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,250
which are existing with your pipe on.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,070
Right?

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,400
So let me explain this with an example.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,840
So I'm going to sail my script name as something like custom exceptions,

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,850
right?

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,740
Si,

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,740
simply I'm using you.

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,340
Rise,

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,750
Exception.

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,230
This is a exception.

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,260
Not know,

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,950
See the output.

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,990
If I run these,

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,510
it is giving like an exception,

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,550
right?

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,740
See what is the exception?

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,710
Name exception itself on what is the error?

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,150
This is exception.

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,830
Not only that,

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,080
suppose if any,

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,470
very was not defined.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:22,740
You know,

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,180
right name era is the exception,

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,760
so variable is not defined.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,250
Wanted glamorizing this.

36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:43,800
That's a But this is not the way to use in your real time support just agenda.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,280
You are trying to really a variable.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,160
It may be anyway,

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,610
let's say simply a Zico's to some 23.

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,630
So when I want Rees,

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,070
if is he's greater than 30 then.

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,270
No,

43
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,250
I don't have any problem.

44
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,900
Bring value is.

45
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:14,310
But if is not less than I mean not greater than 30 then I want to rise an exception in

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,780
giraffe print.

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,270
Dissembling Mrs Wondered Lee.

48
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,540
No,

49
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,870
actually,

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,750
previously we how a study to our wire exceptions.

51
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,790
But now we're trying to learn how to create exceptions.

52
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:33,530
If it required right someone your age is less than 30 then I don't want to run my skip.

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,850
I wanted that made my skip.

54
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,870
I want to stop.

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,270
I need to rise an exception.

56
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,600
Yes,

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,450
you can rise simply race.

58
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,250
So I'm taking Supposed value a little exception,

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,250
right?

60
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,430
So see,

61
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm using existing keywords value era that is already there with your exceptions,

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,910
right?

63
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,560
So the free rays give what is used to rise on existing exceptions.

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,350
Wanted Lee.

65
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,550
It is less than 30.

66
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,250
That's it.

67
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,850
These the way how we can raise a custom exception using rice keyword.

68
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,450
Now we have one more thing called,

69
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:18,890
I said.

70
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:27,290
So Assad is going to use to create your wound exceptions with a name called Asset Error.

71
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,810
Just let me do that say I'm reading simply assert.

72
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,570
See,

73
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,540
first of all,

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,250
how your asset is going to work.

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,510
A set will rise.

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,450
A such an error if the condition becomes false.

77
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,690
I mean,

78
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,510
suppose I'm writing for less than 30.

79
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,300
That is false.

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,350
But if I write for greater than three,

81
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,360
that is correct.

82
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,960
Way no.

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,850
See that I'm running.

84
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,830
It is not raising any exception because condition is true,

85
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,050
right?

86
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,380
If I write conditioners falls now,

87
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,090
see the result.

88
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:11,920
What you're getting you're getting enter called our exception called assess in that So a

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,300
certain is used to create a such an error on whenever.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,930
If we get any assertion error You how to assume that wanted Lee.

91
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,150
You create a,

92
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:29,380
um exception Not right.

93
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,870
So you don't so you can take something like suppose Ah,

94
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,690
if engine off you've condition or that they can give it so Suppose I'm trying to write,

95
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:47,350
try actually a gym that I am reading a supposed easy close to some 30 right?

96
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,720
So now I know not to use if condition directly if I want to rise,

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,370
an exception based on is then I known to use if condition I said itself it is going to walk

98
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,750
us s A.

99
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:09,050
If is less than 30 then only create create an exception.

100
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,260
If it is true,

101
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,360
then see value is let me run it and see the result.

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,740
Yeah,

103
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,150
it is.

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,250
Try and accept Right unit Toe right.

105
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,050
They were accepted block as well.

106
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,240
Let me write.

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:37,650
Except bring Exception occurred,

108
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,140
right?

109
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,950
So what type of position are Sorry What type of exception?

110
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,250
Your creating with help off asset A section Let me run it and see the result.

111
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,710
See,

112
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,570
both are same.

113
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,050
Let me take 33 Then condition will become too right.

114
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,650
I mean no See what you're getting,

115
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:08,070
if is is if for days less than 30 Yeah for these greater than right As per your

116
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,350
requirements if he is greater than 30 No problem,

117
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,550
right?

118
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,350
Let me take my age Is something like 20?

119
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,650
No,

120
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:28,840
If it is not gonna than 30 right then I want to create an assertion at a yes exception is

121
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,950
occurring means assertion batteries running How rising So if you want to handle you were

122
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,220
raised a such an error Yes,

123
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:47,250
you can handle it like except if ever is assistant era Then bring riser with as say,

124
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:55,030
because is he's a less than 30 that no,

125
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,180
see,

126
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,040
that isn't so a certain is going to do on an exception.

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,130
Call assessment.

128
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,350
That's it.

129
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,040
Right.

130
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,280
So,

131
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,500
guys,

132
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,340
for time being,

133
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,850
just have a look about this asset and rice.

134
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,700
I So,

135
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,810
while writing really time skips based on requirement,

136
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,750
I will use rice.

137
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,600
Sometimes you said sometime on simply,

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:20,990
I will use,

139
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,950
try and accept.

140
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,760
It's based on situation.

141
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,990
So up to that,

142
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,470
you have to remember this in Texas night,

143
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,950
and then we will use their while writing over skips.

144
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,670
Okay,

145
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,050
guys,

146
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,550
thank you for watching this video.
