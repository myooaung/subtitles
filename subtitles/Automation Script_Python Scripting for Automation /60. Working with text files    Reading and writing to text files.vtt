00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
prince using Python you can work with,

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.030
like text files,

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.470
Jason files,

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.760
CS refiles,

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.950
HTML files and so on.

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.660
And as off no.

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.050
Here we're going to work with textile files.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.850
So simply working with text files using python.

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.250
So there's before going toe work with your text files using python.

10
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.690
Let's move into our General Jui processor whenever.

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.830
If you want to create or read the country from your text.

12
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.550
If I write,

13
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.010
see what I'm doing is someone I want to get a new fight,

14
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.000
right?

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.270
Yeah,

16
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.110
before that CJ's generally if you want to work with text files ready whole three options,

17
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.550
that is,

18
00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:02.700
you can create a new fight or I'll contain cool on existing fine or just for reading

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.950
purpose Really file content,

20
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.150
right?

21
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.350
See when nobody if you're going with the geo position,

22
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.320
I mean in this way,

23
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.750
right,

24
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.450
Click new,

25
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.050
then you're filing I mean,

26
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.730
let me sell it my file as txt file.

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.050
I mean,

28
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.750
I want to create filers text,

29
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.370
right,

30
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.110
I'm creating.

31
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.740
Let's say file Emma,

32
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.930
someday more dot txt right now I'm going to open it.

33
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.630
After that,

34
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.680
I'm going to open it.

35
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.350
Open it.

36
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.450
Yes,

37
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.650
I will open right.

38
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.080
See you guys in your geo procedure.

39
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.980
Whenever If you open your file,

40
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.880
you can really were file.

41
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.650
You can right content to your fight,

42
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.820
but all the options are available simply by opening your fight in.

43
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.450
Do a more,

44
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.420
but come online or through programming or through scripting.

45
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.050
It's not possible you have to open your file either to write content or to really content

46
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.950
are to add some new data Existing files.

47
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.150
Be clear.

48
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.720
See Ngom or it is possible simply by opening your filing.

49
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.040
Barbara's in through programming.

50
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.450
If you want to work with your files right,

51
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.400
you have to be open your file.

52
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.690
You have so open you are filed either,

53
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.110
and write more means.

54
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.350
If you want to create a new fight,

55
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.610
fight are hard to open.

56
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.850
Your file up anymore means adding new country into adjusting fight.

57
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.660
Then you have lost option that is,

58
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.350
read more just to read right.

59
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.490
See that you can open your file.

60
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.850
If you want to create a new file yard weapon.

61
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.890
Your file with the W more are.

62
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.070
If you're already a file,

63
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.220
and if you want to add,

64
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.550
upend the data to an existing file,

65
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.330
then you have the weapon you're filing upended more are simply If you want to really of

66
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.160
content from your file photo,

67
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.550
open it,

68
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.280
using our more like fine And one more thing this once If you right some content to your

69
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.600
file,

70
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.910
right?

71
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.350
See,

72
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.380
I'm opening steps are important.

73
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.720
I'm opening based on cursor position.

74
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.890
You're going to write contained somebody.

75
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.200
Of course,

76
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.150
I'd somewhere that I'm moving concert to some place then I can like so very,

77
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.350
very cancer Is there based on the customer only you are writing content to your fight,

78
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.250
right?

79
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.000
Fine.

80
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.550
So I assume that I am writing this is it demo?

81
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.450
Fine.

82
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.950
And I'm going to close it while closing it is asking sale option,

83
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.300
but in programming in your pie transcript once.

84
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.120
If you close automatically,

85
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.600
the data will sail into your fight.

86
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.530
You don't need to provide confirmation like sale or don't see whenever.

87
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.010
If you close automatically,

88
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.150
your data will store into your fight,

89
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.540
right?

90
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.130
See?

91
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.450
No,

92
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.360
I'm going toe.

93
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.060
See,

94
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.360
guys,

95
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.040
whether you want to read a content or whether we want to write the content to your file

96
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.780
always you should get in your programming first.

97
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.650
Your Custer position are your file object.

98
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.050
You can take any variable.

99
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.750
I am taking your for file object.

100
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.520
Just assume that this is like your cursor position.

101
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.250
So once,

102
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.240
If you get into your hand conservation,

103
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.080
then after that,

104
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.740
whether you want to read or write,

105
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.350
you can do it.

106
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.860
So no,

107
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.350
I want to get my cancer.

108
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.350
Right.

109
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.650
School.

110
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.110
Right.

111
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.140
Content to your file,

112
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.650
then weapon your file in right more.

113
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.780
Open your filing,

114
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.950
Right More Let's say no file dot Txt m writing,

115
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.090
then w more write more then after that,

116
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.650
simply you can close.

117
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.900
So as of know,

118
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.970
what I'm doing is simply I'm watering your fight and then closing your file while opening.

119
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.320
Right?

120
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.250
I'm giving some filing automatically this file with greater with empty data.

121
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.750
Now,

122
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.880
this is your cancer operation with conservation.

123
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.830
Know where I'm writing any data to your file?

124
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.150
Simply.

125
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.780
I'm closing.

126
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.650
It's like creating empty file,

127
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.840
right?

128
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.590
Let me check it so that he is simply creation off.

129
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.360
Empty file.

130
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.050
That's it.

131
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.130
Let the weapon editor.

132
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.320
So I'm going to open my You can dig a sublime or here to,

133
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.040
um aerator.

134
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.530
What are maybe can take?

135
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.160
I'm going toe.

136
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.650
Suppose Ah sublime text,

137
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.480
right?

138
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.210
Let's open that.

139
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.610
First,

140
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.900
let me create defined so that it's forced off.

141
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.740
All right,

142
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.610
so working with extra files,

143
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.020
you know,

144
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.250
to work with your text fights,

145
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.470
you have different modes,

146
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.990
right?

147
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.590
Really?

148
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.320
Are up in first of all because we are going to create a new file,

149
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.110
isn't that we don't have any files to read?

150
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.950
We need toe,

151
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.290
create some file,

152
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.750
right?

153
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.460
So before going to create always in your hand,

154
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.920
you should have a custom position from your file.

155
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.950
That's why what I'm doing is first,

156
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.200
I'm going to open my file.

157
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.550
Let's say some file,

158
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.050
write some new demo door txt file I'm creating.

159
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.620
So I want to open this in right more.

160
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.350
So now this a file I'm opening for right more.

161
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.510
So once you've opened your file automatically,

162
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.900
this syntax is going to give your custom object.

163
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.230
Simply file object.

164
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.950
That's it.

165
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.330
No.

166
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.540
Based on this object,

167
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.330
you can write some content to your file.

168
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.410
But what I am doing is simply I will open my fight and then close right?

169
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.650
Let me save it.

170
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.250
Be clear.

171
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.920
Let me say what with some name,

172
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.570
right?

173
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.550
So I'm going to store on my desktop.

174
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:50.170
Creative filed R B Wait,

175
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.590
That's it?

176
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.850
No,

177
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.980
this is a python script.

178
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.300
Now.

179
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.100
What I'm doing is I'm going to run our core there.

180
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.410
Simply control.

181
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.210
Be done.

182
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.620
Then you don't have any old put here because you don't know any Prince statement to get

183
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.350
your output right?

184
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.100
Simply we get left file.

185
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:17.090
Let me weapon our for that creative file just now.

186
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.010
Vacated this.

187
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.010
Let me.

188
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.350
Sorry.

189
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.400
That is a by downstairs.

190
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.650
Right.

191
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.150
So our file name is new Demo?

192
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.110
Yes,

193
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.630

194
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.450
New Damodar.

195
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.150
Txt.

196
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.990
Open this.

197
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.380
You don't have any contact because you just open and close your file.

198
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.450
Okay?

199
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.150
But I will write toe our data to your file.

200
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.950
But before that,

201
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.310
suppose I want to see in which more your files were paying.

202
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.540
You can check it.

203
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.450
Simply bring your for not more.

204
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.950
So it is going to you the more off your file.

205
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.910
Right?

206
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.360
More Right.

207
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.020
Then let me come in this.

208
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.850
No,

209
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.160
you can check it.

210
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.710
Therefore,

211
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.470
door readable after the good.

212
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.620
What you're getting Yeah,

213
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.600
this is a function.

214
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.450
Let me Donny.

215
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:17.710
False You're getting That means you open your file not for read some other thing.

216
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.790
Maybe right more up and more that we have seen by using it for not more so.

217
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.960
If we're not readable,

218
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.910
it is going to give false means.

219
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.750
You can't read the content if you open your file with the view more.

220
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.110
That's a Let me print one more thing.

221
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.650
A four door rideable.

222
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.350
Yes.

223
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.350
Through your getting.

224
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.070
Yes,

225
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.110
we converted some contento.

226
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.150
This file actually,

227
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.090
no need to check this.

228
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.420
Yes,

229
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.210
there are some options.

230
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.930
That's why I'm giving this right now.

231
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.750
Let me come in this entire court.

232
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.760
Be clear now what I'm doing,

233
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.080
Guys,

234
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.180
I want to write a file.

235
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.390
Then first weapon with some named random name.

236
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.250
You can take anything,

237
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.830
right?

238
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.800
I'm begins up was random dot Txt.

239
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.710
So you want to write their file at very first time?

240
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.920
You don't have any file previously agenda Then open it in right more so I know.

241
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.870
But if you open with this intact automatically,

242
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.950
or Brighton will go your file object.

243
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.190
Imagine that.

244
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.150
That is like a custom.

245
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.650
Anyone not back?

246
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.720
Yes.

247
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.050
Now in your handy Harvard cancer position,

248
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:28.190
then one I want to do is I want to read some content than based on your consideration.

249
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.630
Just don't write operation.

250
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.020
Let me.

251
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.350
Right.

252
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.450
This is a first line I'm writing.

253
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.290
Then after that,

254
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.950
Muzi.

255
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.470
So that's what we do.

256
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.310
This just we hold it on three lines off court to create a filing to write some country in

257
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.460
tow.

258
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.550
That fight now you feel run this court,

259
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.050
then only your file will create.

260
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.560
You heard it in a python script just to create your file with content off.

261
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.450
This is a This is first line,

262
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.950
right?

263
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.190
Let me say we don't want it.

264
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.600
It's a done right.

265
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.250
Let me go to here.

266
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.170
Somebody will have random.

267
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.630
See that?

268
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.750
Let me open this fight.

269
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.250
This is it.

270
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.950
First line okays.

271
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.980
What I'm doing is I'm going to read one more lane,

272
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.850
right?

273
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.750
This is a second line.

274
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.950
Let me save it on Ronnie.

275
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.150
What's in your file and see the country?

276
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.290
This is the first line.

277
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.520
This is the second line.

278
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.120
You're getting both the lines in the same line in your fine.

279
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.750
But actually,

280
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.070
that is not our requirement.

281
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.950
We need to get.

282
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.520
This is the first line in one line.

283
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.000
This is the second line in next line.

284
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.550
But then what If you want booze,

285
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.540
but What?

286
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.790
If you want to send the next line into next line at the end off,

287
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.740
you can every line you had to write slash and so that your constable Good next line.

288
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.250
I mean,

289
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.050
generally,

290
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.380
you know,

291
00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.190
suppose Rajinder you're going to write some content in any file,

292
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.510
right?

293
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.070
So what I'm doing is my newly I'm typing.

294
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.810
This is a life nice.

295
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:12.590
If I wanted contented next land what I'm being I'm wondering my under keep on my keyboard

296
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.700
right then Only a custody is going to next line.

297
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.290
That's what I'm doing here with help off slash in for last lines up.

298
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.380
But if this is large sign,

299
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.170
you need to send your custom the next line.

300
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.550
That's it.

301
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.990
Let me save it under on it.

302
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.580
So before Ryan,

303
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.300
let me close this file.

304
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.750
Yeah,

305
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.150
Chocolate on it.

306
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.660
No weapon.

307
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.250
You're fine.

308
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.950
Take the country.

309
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.760
Now you have.

310
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.780
This is the first line.

311
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.650
One line is the second leading next line,

312
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.590
right?

313
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.270
So automatically your custody sending the next line.

314
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:52.420
Suppose if I want read one more line right then this is a car line and writing.

315
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.580
So that is not only here before writing your Tylenol so you can send your concert the next

316
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.780
line slash and mean simply,

317
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.480
Or Castle will go to next line in next land this contemptible.

318
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:01.750
Right?

319
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.850
But providing slash are not very First,

320
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.600
any line is not a good practice.

321
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.750
That's why always we mentioned at the end off your content slash and you need to remember

322
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.250
this one.

323
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.520
Let me save it underneath.

324
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.120
So where is your fight?

325
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.340
Yeah,

326
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.810
Random.

327
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.290
Open it and see the continue.

328
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.150
How three lines.

329
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.580
And one more thing,

330
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:22.980
guys,

331
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.160
it's very important.

332
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.280
I am running thescore again and again.

333
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.250
Let me run it once.

334
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:32.950
I don't second time Third time three times on this creep.

335
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.410
But if you after your content,

336
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:35.830
right?

337
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.750
If you're do your content it is only three lines.

338
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.850
So you can feel I mean ah,

339
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.340
you are running your court three times.

340
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.850
Then maybe your data will be there three times anymore.

341
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.620
Fine.

342
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.520
But it is not there nor fighting 300 is there only one time.

343
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.350
So you are not getting like this.

344
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.480
No,

345
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.060
you're running your program three times.

346
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.350
Then you're not getting your file in this way.

347
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.650
Your data is not repeating three times in your file it won't happen.

348
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.710
See what?

349
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.990
Actually it is doing whenever.

350
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.700
If you open your file and write more,

351
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.650
it's very important whenever if you open your filing right more.

352
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.870
If I is already there,

353
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.690
then first off all your python will simply remove this file on.

354
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.210
Then same file name will be created.

355
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.250
If file is not that new fight is going to create.

356
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.430
Oh,

357
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.380
if file is not that it will create a new file.

358
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.660
The file is already there.

359
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.250
Your content.

360
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.150
We will overwrite.

361
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.300
Your content will overwrite.

362
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.350
See that?

363
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.250
Suppose I'm going to read here,

364
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.010
let me delete these two lines.

365
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:50.750
So what I'm doing is this is a new content.

366
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.850
Let me save it on gun it don't.

367
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.650
I know.

368
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.450
See the content,

369
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:06.060
your previous that have gone only new content is there Previously you help three lines,

370
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.450
right?

371
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.350
But now you're only one night that easiness.

372
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.060
But what if you open your file and write more?

373
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.970
Simply You can assume that if already file is there with this name that final dilate and

374
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.250
knew the same name new file will create.

375
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.000
It finally is not the first time you're going to create that file.

376
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.650
That's it right.

377
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.710
Fine.

378
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.610
So that is here you are writing.

379
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.950
You were content to your file one by one.

380
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.650
I mean,

381
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.080
suppose if I want write three lines how you're going to write three times You're using your

382
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.330
full dot right there Food or right?

383
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.000
Therefore not right.

384
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.590
No,

385
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.150
it off that.

386
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.990
See,

387
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.550
What I'm doing is I'm going to come in these three lines injured off that instead of that.

388
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.880
Therefore,

389
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.800
daughter right lines on here.

390
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.080
Your toe,

391
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.750
probably or data as a list.

392
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.580
You can also story.

393
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:57.980
What data?

394
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.510
Somewhere as a list.

395
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:10.080
Let's say my content after 300 a Gaza list in at least each and every value is one line.

396
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.290
Let's say this is it data one Suppose so.

397
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.780
Ideally,

398
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.100
how tr slash in like so if you don't are,

399
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.260
you can also take care.

400
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:20.470
Well,

401
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.810
I think your content to your file with help off Luke,

402
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.670
I will show you that.

403
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.390
Meanwhile,

404
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.340
first off to get basic idea,

405
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.290
I'm giving in this way.

406
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:34.960
This is a data to then This is a data three.

407
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.670
Suppose right.

408
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.150
See if I don't adhere slash And what will happen?

409
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.550
Let me say it.

410
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:47.330
So guys injured operating lane by leading with the elbow fear for dot Right function right

411
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.740
before not right mattered.

412
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.710
What we are doing is therefore not right.

413
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.640
Lines here again.

414
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.200
Property where?

415
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.450
Content as a list.

416
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.120
Now our content is a list somewhere we have our list off content.

417
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.450
Here.

418
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.750
Let me save it.

419
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.550
Underneath it.

420
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.170
Same file memorandum previously.

421
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.300
How?

422
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.580
This information right now what we did,

423
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.130
we weapon that file in w more.

424
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.780
That means if there is any files with the same name that content will delete or that file

425
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.930
will delete on new content.

426
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.150
We will will rightto this file.

427
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.080
Now let me go to here and open your files.

428
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:25.420
See that this is a data One is a data to this is a data three if in case if you want to

429
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.840
send,

430
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.890
this is a data three next line what?

431
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.150
You have to go at the end off even second line.

432
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.250
The hard right slash and right,

433
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.420
fine,

434
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.200
but providing slash.

435
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.660
And at the end of each and every lane,

436
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.080
it's not a good practice.

437
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.760
Automatically new to our slash and for each and every line.

438
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.710
Right?

439
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.160
So,

440
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.480
for that,

441
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.790
what I'm doing is no.

442
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.150
Let me come into all this thing?

443
00:16:47.150 --> 00:17:01.350
You Mexican?

444
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.390
No,

445
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.130
I'm going to a different file name.

446
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.550
I don't want u same Phi limp.

447
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.910
Of course you can use it.

448
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.350
No problem.

449
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.710
Let me take first.

450
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:10.230
Awful.

451
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:16.400
My content as something like this is using Look back.

452
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.290
Medic Iteration one.

453
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:27.450
Then this is using no federation.

454
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.550
Do let me copy this data one more time,

455
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.790
right?

456
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.850
See that?

457
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.850
So what I'm doing is this is it.

458
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.160
Extradite.

459
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.010
So let me daily says it.

460
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.260
Three.

461
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.170
No,

462
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.140
first of all days.

463
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.950
First of all,

464
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:50.270
I can take one by one value from your list using for loop rate.

465
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.370
If you remember for each line,

466
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.040
let me take.

467
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.950
You can take any available year for each line in my content.

468
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.470
Right?

469
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.420
See what I'm doing?

470
00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.850
Bring each line,

471
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.920
say,

472
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.760
with Atlantic,

473
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.850
you're getting one by one line.

474
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:04.910
Now,

475
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.090
before printing your line at the end.

476
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.060
I'm earning slash In your no problem,

477
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.570
you can add it.

478
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:09.790
No.

479
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.350
Yes.

480
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:16.770
Know what I'm doing is I want to create a file with this content,

481
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.660
whatever the content you have in your list.

482
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.160
So I want to create a file call.

483
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:28.360
Let's say victor loop dot Txt I want to create this file.

484
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.380
So opening right more so it is going to give a file object.

485
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:33.930
Actually,

486
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.860
there is a class.

487
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.170
Okay,

488
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.570
As of now,

489
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.550
you can't understand that.

490
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.180
Yes,

491
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.230
I gender here for is it Carson?

492
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.360
Just for the water understanding.

493
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.160
But what I'm giving you for as a couple days.

494
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.930
But if you're gender,

495
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.980
it is going to work the same operation.

496
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.700
Whatever your custody is doing inju way more so just know we got indoor handcuffs.

497
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.890
Operation off this file Now what we have to do,

498
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.660
we want to write line by line,

499
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.700
contain to your with Luke Got txt file.

500
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.420
So you know,

501
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.740
if you have a one single line,

502
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.110
how you're going to write your data,

503
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.050
your four door,

504
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.080
right?

505
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.720
That's it.

506
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.400
See,

507
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.260
what I'm doing is automatically I'm taking line by land from your list.

508
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.470
And I'm writing that line to your file with Alpo.

509
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.320
Fear for dot Right?

510
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.880
May 3rd other than while writing at the end off each of Neverland,

511
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.340
I'm reading slash in No,

512
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.350
no need to manually right,

513
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.590
slash and teach the enough each and every line.

514
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.800
Right?

515
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.810
I think this is not a practice good practice because you're going to get your data from

516
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.350
somewhere.

517
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.400
There may be numb number off lines,

518
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.760
right.

519
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.610
So logically into tired slash and at the end,

520
00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.020
off your each and every line,

521
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.700
while adding that data to your file.

522
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.160
That's it.

523
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.010
Right?

524
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.150
So after this one,

525
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.910
your do you completed your for loop?

526
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.310
Suppose for three generations this loop is going to over then after Luke,

527
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.060
don't forget to close your file once.

528
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.720
If you close your file automatically,

529
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.710
the data will store.

530
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.300
Will say Oh into your file called with the loo.

531
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.190
Got txt file.

532
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.990
Let me save it under on it then.

533
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.050
Now go to here somewhere.

534
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.550
See,

535
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.840
with the loop is there?

536
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.660
Open that to that.

537
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.050
Like Fine.

538
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:17.790
See,

539
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.840
I suppose if you have some file somewhere,

540
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.900
all the file is there on you don't want to be stopped the existing data and you want to

541
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:31.830
upend the new data to your file that nothing is there Simply weapon Your file in more yet

542
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.450
upend at the end.

543
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.160
You're going to our new data.

544
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.550
They let me save it under it once.

545
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:39.810
See,

546
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.950
guys previously you how the content Dinner file three lines country.

547
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.620
Know what I'm doing is I'm opening my filing upend more whenever If you open your fighting

548
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.450
up anymore.

549
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.420
If this fight is existing,

550
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.440
it won't disturb the existing data.

551
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.140
It will give that data as this.

552
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.950
Then the new data will be a pender at the end off your file.

553
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.290
So same content.

554
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.450
I want blood once again to my file.

555
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.630
Yes,

556
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.820
just opening up in the more right.

557
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.090
See that I'm running.

558
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.540
It's done.

559
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.880
Now open your file.

560
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.850
See that your data is there two times.

561
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:21.840
One second you can run so that once again the same that I you're goingto happen at the end

562
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:21.840
.

563
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.560
Off your file now.

564
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.590
Three more excellence.

565
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.680
Let me weapon that file.

566
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.950
Yes,

567
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.160
right Fine.

568
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.450
Now imagine that We don't know how this fight.

569
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.550
Let me remove this file.

570
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.480
Nice.

571
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.610
Whenever if you tryto upended data.

572
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.430
So this file If it is there,

573
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.260
then the new data will be up in there at the end.

574
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.060
If it is not there,

575
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.780
no problem.

576
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.620
You're fighting will create a new file now.

577
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.710
So if file is not there then happened more on w more.

578
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:58.270
Both are saying if fighting is not that upended more and then write more.

579
00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:58.950
Both are same.

580
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.350
Now let me save it on money.

581
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.310
I'm running.

582
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.600
It's done without any errors.

583
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.950
Means it works perfectly.

584
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.640
Let me weapon your file.

585
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:07.810
See,

586
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.290
now you got with the loop file.

587
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:17.610
Three lanes off content now I'm going to rely on So already three lanes off information is

588
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.120
there now because of this far loop Same content you're going to write once again.

589
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.260
Three lines off information,

590
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.570
right?

591
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.180
Let me open it and see the desert.

592
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:31.010
So that is the use off your upended more That is the use off.

593
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.350
You were up anymore.

594
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.310
That's it.

595
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:40.720
So this is the way how you can create a new fight or how you can upend new content to your

596
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.350
existing files Night.

597
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.310
Fine.

598
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.510
No,

599
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.720
What I want to is I have some file right already.

600
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.070
We know we have a file called with the loop dot Txt.

601
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.610
Now I want to read the content using your python.

602
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.730
I want to read the content using your python.

603
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.330
Nothing is their first.

604
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.580
Whether you want to read or write your contend with your python.

605
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:05.220
First off all your toe weapon your file But while opening your file right,

606
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:11.710
you have to right you're required more here whether you want to write or read.

607
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.920
Now,

608
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.610
my purposes.

609
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.640
I want to see the data.

610
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.800
I want to read the data.

611
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.040
Then open your filing.

612
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:16.660
Read more.

613
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.260
That's it.

614
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.050
So whether you're going to write your country into your file or whether you're going toe

615
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.190
really content from your file,

616
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.210
you have to do one thing open and close.

617
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.350
Don't forget about this.

618
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.720
If you don't close,

619
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.040
then ah,

620
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.050
sometimes your file make corrupt,

621
00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.110
right?

622
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.510
Fine.

623
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.440
No,

624
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.780
I weapon in.

625
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.290
Read more.

626
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:43.650
I close it like let me excluded Nora nor poor.

627
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.040
Whenever.

628
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.490
If you're reading means you should display something,

629
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.910
then only you can see the country.

630
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.010
Now.

631
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.610
How can I display the content?

632
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:50.880
Nothing.

633
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.160
Is there simply print,

634
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.960
therefore not read.

635
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.170
If we're not read,

636
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:56.850
see the country.

637
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:02.010
You're going to get your entire data after time using your forgot read operation.

638
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.400
You can also store this into one variable called.

639
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.350
Let me take a data data off your file.

640
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.950
That's it.

641
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.100
After closing your file.

642
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.260
You how Your data in a data available.

643
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.350
That's it.

644
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.210
See?

645
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.260
I weapon.

646
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.870
I read the data and I stored into some variable called data.

647
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.140
Now,

648
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.040
even If you close your file already,

649
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.410
we store the file content to some variable,

650
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.280
not variable.

651
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.890
We can use it.

652
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.140
Fine.

653
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.410
So after time,

654
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.850
If you want to read your entire content is the procedure.

655
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.340
Now what I want raise.

656
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.880
I want to read one by one.

657
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.700
Line one by one line.

658
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.500
I want to read.

659
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.940
See that?

660
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.540
What I'm doing anyway?

661
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.030
If you want to read always your toe Open your filing.

662
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.760
Read more then your four door read line.

663
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.610
That's it Then let me close it and see the content.

664
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.810
What?

665
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.910
You're going to get study?

666
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.690
You read the data.

667
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:03.880
But a unit of printed that right?

668
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.690
Then only you can see the data print the what?

669
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.710
Or the data you're reading.

670
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.370
That's what this is A.

671
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.220
This is using lubrication one.

672
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.180
Now I want to read second line,

673
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:22.910
then immediately do Once again you are read line Nazi but reading line by line.

674
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.160
I don't know how many lines you have in your file,

675
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.960
right?

676
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.800
So this is not a good practice to read your file,

677
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.070
but you have the option.

678
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.110
Some things very rare cases.

679
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.260
You will use this one also.

680
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.940
But remember that uses as Well,

681
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.660
no,

682
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:38.990
I want to.

683
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.260
Really?

684
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.490
Your entire content,

685
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.870
Arthur.

686
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.260
Time.

687
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.090
So previously.

688
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.260
What?

689
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.350
All the data you are reading with the elbow fear for not read.

690
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.080
I see that.

691
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:59.850
Let me enable this one's let me print a data on What is the data you are having in that?

692
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.620
You know you have a data.

693
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.070
You're dead,

694
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.450
right?

695
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:03.730
See the output?

696
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.190
What is a type of order that is a string right?

697
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.610
Costing you how number off lines in your file.

698
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.190
I want to take line by line separately.

699
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.350
But I want to read at a time all the lines.

700
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.790
I won't read all the lines at your time,

701
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.210
but I want to take line by line separately.

702
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.260
Not like a string.

703
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.030
Right.

704
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.160
See what I'm doing?

705
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:32.950
What I'm doing here is you have one more option just to read your entire content in B A

706
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.450
list.

707
00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.630
First of all,

708
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.550
let me open my file.

709
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:42.760
Then that would take there,

710
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.160
Doc.

711
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.180
It costs two your file up their daughter read lines.

712
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.700
It's very,

713
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.350
very important.

714
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.920
It is very useful in your real time.

715
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.430
Now let me print your data and see that would put what you're going to get your getting as

716
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.900
a list you're getting as a list.

717
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.830
If it is a list,

718
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.660
you know you can take you for a loop when you can print line by line support.

719
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.690
I want rid simply.

720
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.770
I'm giving if I want to read 1st 3 lines What I will lose.

721
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:16.620
See that for each in range off three.

722
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.740
First,

723
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.360
let me print.

724
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.850
What is the each value you are getting?

725
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.810
There is no relation as off No.

726
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.170
Between your for loop on your data.

727
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.700
Simply I'm taking some range of food is going to print it.

728
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.990
Do you know want to late now?

729
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.620
This data is a list right in list.

730
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.550
If you want to read first of three values,

731
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:44.080
then index values are from Jiro to write Jiro one too.

732
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.820
So if you take a range of three,

733
00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.550
you are getting your required in next valleys for your list to get your top three lines.

734
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:58.820
Know what I'm doing is I'm bringing your data then in next value guys for foster duration

735
00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.350
your reaches,

736
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.620
of course.

737
00:27:59.620 --> 00:27:59.970
Zero.

738
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.310
That means you are printing simply debt off Jiro.

739
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.830
Then second iteration,

740
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:10.220
you're getting index value as 1 30 aggression and you're getting in next value asked to.

741
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.080
That's it.

742
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.440
This is the data you're going to print using your follow.

743
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.760
That means you're getting top three lines.

744
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.570
But right.

745
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.500
So guys know what I want to raise.

746
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.890
I want to get only last life.

747
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.650
I want to get only last line.

748
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:28.550
How can I get it?

749
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.760
You know,

750
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.920
data.

751
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.160
Last lane,

752
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.050
always already in data is released,

753
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.800
right in least last value index in terms off negatives.

754
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.410
Right.

755
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:42.050
Minus one.

756
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.590
Then I can print this one.

757
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.660
Let me come.

758
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.450
And your for Luke.

759
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:52.660
That's it.

760
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:57.450
Right.

761
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.630
So this is the usage with the red lines.

762
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.440
We have so many real time cases,

763
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:03.840
right?

764
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.050
The just introduction.

765
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.130
We will see some simple,

766
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.850
real time example in next radio.

767
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.660
Okay,

768
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.400
so there's finally hard to remember that life the right more?

769
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:15.770
Yeah.

770
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.510
While working with your files,

771
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.760
you have three options.

772
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.220
First option is you're going to create a new file.

773
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.500
First time you're going to create,

774
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.550
then open in love,

775
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:24.950
you more.

776
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:30.190
So while opening your filing this more if already file is there,

777
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.610
then what it will do your part on is going to deliver that file and he's going to create a

778
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:39.440
new file so that what will happen all the file information will be Della Terry.

779
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:48.180
So be careful whenever If you're opening your filing w more I want to keep all country.

780
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.850
And as Idris and I want to our new content,

781
00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.290
I want to upend new content to your file.

782
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:58.400
Then you are to open that in up and more.

783
00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.450
No,

784
00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.140
I want to read all the country which is there in my file,

785
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.850
then weapon read more so whether you are going to write open or reek right?

786
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.150
Plus it is same.

787
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.520
See Write your full file object Open your file and get into your hand your custom.

788
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.290

Here.

790
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.280
Finally close your file.

791
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.660
That's it.

792
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.160
Fine.

793
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.850
Okay.
