1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
friends here.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,750
Our concept Please constructor off a class.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,810
See,

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:12,230
this constructor is a method in your class and this is a special method On this mother is

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,390
called by the Ford.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,780
Whenever you create an object from a class See,

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,150
we know that classes nothing Bird combination off attributes and methods and we never if

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,510
you won't be,

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,810
execute any method from your class.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,150
Always you need toe Call that from your object.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,250
Right?

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,830
But if you define a constructor matter inside off a class you know Nieto call that by

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,290
default.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,650
It will execute whenever if you create an object Let me explain this with a simple by

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,890
transcript So I'm taking name is constructor Hopes not be white.

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,510
Let me create simple class like employees.

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,860
Then under that,

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,210
I am defending a method called simply display.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,650
You can take anything display then what I'm doing is simply I'm reading a prince treatment

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:00,650
.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,690
This is a display Matar then simply done None.

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,830
That's it.

23
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,360
So my classes having only one method Now let me clear to objects.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,920
Let's say employees Juanico's toe employees and then play two equals two employees.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,790
And if I run this court,

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,320
do we have any or put no.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,540
Because to get some more port this print statement you need to call this matter so you can

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,090
call it a matter neither from object One are from your objected to.

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,150
So this is from object one I can also call from object to the same method.

30
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,850
That's fine.

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,150
So finally,

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,750
if there is any matter inside off your class And if you only Xcor that you need to call

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:57,430
your matter from your partner object they But no my requirement days Let me write one more

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,120
matter here.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,950
But that method name is there is a default name for that underscored underscored in it

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,440
Underscore underscore then by the fall your right oneself keyword right oneself argument

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,780
for any matter which is there in your class the No let me print.

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,950
This is a innit met hard.

39
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,350
Um let me rate return None.

40
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,620
So you know,

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,710
if you want to exclude general,

42
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,030
any matter we're calling their?

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,340
No.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,250
Let me remove this.

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,850
Even if you keep it will call your disclaim attack,

46
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,850
right?

47
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,550
No,

48
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,180
Let me run.

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,800
See the output?

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,110
Gross body?

51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,450
Yeah,

52
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,650
it is written by most.

53
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,880
Either we're not calling this matter But still it is able to display the information from

54
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,540
this prince straight.

55
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,850
Man,

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:02,330
this is a innit Matar on it is calling bitey for when it is calling When every few create

57
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,610
an absurd When nobody feel assign your class for your object are the remedy is calling

58
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,810
bitey for right now So let me remove this play matter now we don't We're not calling any

59
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,050
mattered but still you're getting output means initial aviation mature will call by default

60
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,550
whenever If you create an object from your class that's your No,

61
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:31,500
I can take this Installation matter uses us different ways you can use So suppose I'm

62
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,650
goingto take this initial ation matter increase might obstetrical.

63
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,500
So,

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,040
you know,

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,300
in previous cessation,

66
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,560
right,

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
we are taken some counter variable on forcefully.

68
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,540
We are calling some increase cone for employees than there were increasing or variable Know

69
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,700
what I am doing is directly I'm defending a variable called County Costa Jiro initially and

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,110
then,

71
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,010
like many more this prince treatment,

72
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,870
you can keep that statement as well.

73
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,400
No problem.

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,450
Know what I'm doing is you were class variable equals two employees door cone.

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,450
Bless one.

76
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,650
Okay.

77
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,340
Now,

78
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,790
before creating object.

79
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,040
Let me remove all these things as off.

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,350
No,

81
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,990
you don't have any object.

82
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,310
That's why insulation matter is not going to call Now.

83
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:38,390
Let me bring first the number off objects create there from employees class or as off?

84
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,600
No.

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,050
There are no objects from your class.

86
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,220
That's why you're not Put this somewhere.

87
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,850
What is the problem?

88
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,800
Okay,

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,770
be or a and e See,

90
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,950
that isn't currently there are no objects created from your class.

91
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,550
Now let me create one object from my class.

92
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,090
So I'm creating suppose employees.

93
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,790
One equals two employees.

94
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,300
No,

95
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,680
See the reserve You're getting automatically one way whenever.

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,970
If you do in this way,

97
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,350
you're creating one employee.

98
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,730
One observer at that time in this employee one my third Sorry.

99
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,310
In this employee,

100
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,420
one object automatically dissimulation matter is calling whenever it is calling whenever it

101
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,200
is executing.

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,950
Right calling means you're going to exclude this whenever it is excluding inside that were

103
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,210
increasing or counter value employees counter value.

104
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,920
Now let me call Let me create one more object and see the result.

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,150
Now you're getting too right.

106
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,430
So simply guys in insulation is a special method which will call by default.

107
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,560
Whenever If we create an object from your class and inside that you can at any lousy I'm

108
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,750
taking here toe increase my employee count objects.

109
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,250
Right?

110
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,480
Okay,

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,090
Now let me write one more thing.

112
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,350
I'm going to use this initial ation mattered in one more way also.

113
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,350
Let me right.

114
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,150
You stays off,

115
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,090
Constructor.

116
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,750
Don't be way.

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,210
See you guys first.

118
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,610
Awful.

119
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,550
I'm defending a class called employees.

120
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,050
Four days.

121
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,890
You can define your class in two ways.

122
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm in syntax.

123
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,150
This is one way and one more is simply class employees object.

124
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,450
Don't worry about objects.

125
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,160
Actually,

126
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,890
while discussing about inheritance,

127
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,150
you will use this concert.

128
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,330
But if you are not using evidence than first impacts on seconds index,

129
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,050
both are correct,

130
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,780
right?

131
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,510
But anyway,

132
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,330
if you want to make this always correct than use class employees in currency,

133
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,120
just write object.

134
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,440
But you don't worry about that object.

135
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,110
What is that object?

136
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,000
How you're going to use?

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,190
We're not going to use it.

138
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,450
We'll discuss that in her in evidence concert.

139
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,340
So from from no one words,

140
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,310
when nobody's going to define a class,

141
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,620
please take class.

142
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,440
Last name,

143
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,320
then impotent.

144
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,350
This just right object.

145
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,190
That's fine.

146
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,140
No,

147
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,650
I'm writing a method to define name on salary.

148
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,790
Well,

149
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,240
let me dig.

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,550
Name your salary.

151
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,700
You know,

152
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,650
the foliar right self on this matter is to define name on salary.

153
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,650
Then we're expecting name on salary values.

154
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,850
The let me write itself not name it caused to name.

155
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:27,050
Then Self Lord salary equals two celery then simply right to return month.

156
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,150
Then let me write one more matter just to display what information off party are absurd

157
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:46,920
Bring the name is simply right here.

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,750
Name self door name then in next lane.

159
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:07,480
Celery is Saudi slash invite next lane The salary he's so whatever the salary for your

160
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,000
employees,

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,830
just write that Salvi So what is the sell for Lord salary?

162
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,190
That's it.

163
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,520
Right?

164
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,950
And finally right of return.

165
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,370
So,

166
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:17,580
guys,

167
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,690
how didn't hold defined template or class on?

168
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,490
If I run these as if no,

169
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,620
there are no objects,

170
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,900
no good tonight?

171
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,500
No.

172
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,360
Let me create an object Employees one equals two first win it our sign our class or

173
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,610
template toe this object Then if you want to create variables or attributes for that then

174
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,820
you have to call related methods.

175
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,150
So I am calling suppose with some celery.

176
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,750
So I created one observed as off No.

177
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,160
And let me great!

178
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,650
One more out object if you want for name on Sally for second objects.

179
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,480
Let's stay.

180
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,050
Ah,

181
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,150
not Indra.

182
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,250
Then look me right.

183
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,450
Some salary.

184
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,650
What happened?

185
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,500
Okay,

186
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,620
we did not create out there,

187
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:10,930
right?

188
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,940
So first we need to create an object.

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,740
And by two equals two not to So we created two objects.

190
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,290
So guys,

191
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,050
you can create your object at any place.

192
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,460
After that,

193
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,050
you can call.

194
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,570
So put it you can create first your number off objects.

195
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,340
Then you can call.

196
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,250
You required a method for each object.

197
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,210
Anyway,

198
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,850
this is fine.

199
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:40,430
No next thing I want to display the information Then whether he wanted display information

200
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,430
,

201
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,220
first object or second object.

202
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,450
So I want to display information for first object.

203
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,350
Then first object dot display.

204
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,950
Then I want to get the information for second object.

205
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,590
Then second object dot display.

206
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,050
That's it.

207
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,650
So,

208
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:53,920
guys,

209
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,190
if I take initial ation matter uses see how I'm going to implement the same court?

210
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:11,050
Let me write one more thing using in it metadata be like First of all,

211
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:21,280
let me take Seem glass name then under that initial isn't in turn off this foster mattered

212
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,910
What?

213
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:34,120
I'm going to take these see into off This is salary I am defining in a in isolation.

214
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,450
Met there.

215
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,350
So this is a matter tonight.

216
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,320
Any number of arguments based on your requirement.

217
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,150
Previously we have taken simply self.

218
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,350
That means we have not passing any argument.

219
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,570
No year.

220
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,180
We are ready to take some arguments for insulation matter.

221
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,170
But how to pass?

222
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,690
We will see.

223
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,100
No,

224
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,050
simply right.

225
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,320
Self lord name equals two name on.

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,910
Then Self Lord salary.

227
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,250
It was too suddenly.

228
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,750
Simply write return None.

229
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,350
Let me take this displacement velocities.

230
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,130
Okay,

231
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:20,350
No guys previously injured or finish elation matter You are having name on salary matter.

232
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,200
But you know whenever there is insulation matter that will exclude by the four.

233
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,590
So if it is executing,

234
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,050
it is expecting name on salary?

235
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,350
No,

236
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,320
if you don't know how this noble If you have a insulation better in this way it is not

237
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,210
taking any argument.

238
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,050
Then no problem by day for two legs.

239
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,360
Cute.

240
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,950
You don't need to pass arguments for that.

241
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,030
But if you're here anyway,

242
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,680
anybody If they create an object.

243
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,850
Let me create an absurd.

244
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:52,980
And if I run no court because off this we're creating an object at that time.

245
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,150
By the fall insulation,

246
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,280
metal will call if it is calling.

247
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,750
It needs to arguments.

248
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,200
Then how we can pass.

249
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,420
If you're not passing,

250
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,050
see that you're going to get another going initial ation matter.

251
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,250
Missing two required operational arguments.

252
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,950
Name on salary Right now nothing.

253
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,760
Is there anybody?

254
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,470
If you are creating an absurd here itself,

255
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,660
you can pass.

256
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,850
You were required values.

257
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,250
See that?

258
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,290
No,

259
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm going to run.

260
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,030
You're not getting an error?

261
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,400
No.

262
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,690
Let me call employees.

263
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,150
Wonder display details.

264
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,690
Yes,

265
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,380
You are getting so guys comfort to this court.

266
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,650
What is that one this year?

267
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:46,490
So in this previous court to create your self dot name or partner object d'art name object

268
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,490
d'art Salvi we need to call name salary matter.

269
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,970
We're creating object and then create that information for your object We are defining.

270
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,820
We are excluding.

271
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,150
We're calling a method called name salary.

272
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,030
So we're writing one extra line.

273
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,550
But here moment right there.

274
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,280
Whenever.

275
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,690
If you're creating an absurd,

276
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,220
are that time the required variables.

277
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,110
Arguments for your installation mattered you can pass here itself so that you're creating

278
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,450
particular object information.

279
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,980
See,

280
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,160
now I'm displaying employees.

281
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,650
One details.

282
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,550
You're getting that right?

283
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,260
No,

284
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,450
The same way I can also create any number of objects.

285
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,950
So let me take imply you too.

286
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,400
Suppose I am passing?

287
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,300
Not in 90,004 months Salary?

288
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,810
No,

289
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,110
I'm running your employees to object has been created and play.

290
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,120
One officer has been created But I want to see the information about employees to then call

291
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:51,450
display matter even if you don't want to call display matter externally we have a short cut

292
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,740
anyway.

293
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,150
Bitey fall insulation Mother is calling No in there just right Self lord display That's it

294
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,150
.

295
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,880
Be clear whenever If you're calling your method outside off a class you hard toe point with

296
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:13,410
respect to observe But inside sell for dark self not display So guys no to assign it to

297
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:19,050
display information simply we're having only two lines But in previous court see that to

298
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,080
create your objects One Metarie hard to call to display Hard to calls up was one moment

299
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,400
Anyway,

300
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,490
it also you can call this matter inside of this but compared toa this matter here we're

301
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,260
losing at least one line now.

302
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,950
See the result?

303
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,350
That's it.

304
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,000
If you don't want to call this matter from insulation matter,

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,220
if you want to call externally.

306
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,420
Yes,

307
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,820
you can also call excellently by using employees $1.

308
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,000
Display our employees to your display.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,950
That's it.

310
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,520
So there's finally the advantage off initialization memories.

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,010
You can create your attributes if you follow this index.

312
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,350
If you've all of this impacts,

313
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,340
you can create your attributes while creating your object.

314
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,600
That's it so that you're going to reduce one line.

315
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,840
So if I take any method other than insulation matter,

316
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,860
toe creates your name on salary attributes for your opposite.

317
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,610
I need to call that matter here in this way.

318
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,080
How taking your name name on Salvi then to create your name and salary are variable for

319
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,770
your object.

320
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,200
I need to call in this way.

321
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,750
But if you views if you use initialization method,

322
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,320
no need to call by the fall.

323
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,950
You can create the attributes or variables for your partner Object.

324
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,720
That's it.

325
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,450
That is that One days with constructor off Mitter.

326
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,950
I hope you're clear with this installation matter.

327
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,260
Okay,

328
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,530
guys,

329
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,850
thank you for watching this with you.
