00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
prints here.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:10.010
We're going toe practice with your conditional statements on that practices reading number

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.990
between one button right and then displayed in terms off words.

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.010
So if you run your pie transcript it has toe ask.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.150
Enter your number,

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.630
then you,

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.120
Otto,

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.150
enter any number like 123 are up to 10.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.750
Then after that,

10
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.490
through your pipes landscape,

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.750
we are displayed that number in terms off words.

12
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.090
So that is what I'm going to develop with your conditional statements,

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.750
right?

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.710
Let me open my everyday.

15
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.120
So they say,

16
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.070
is my editor.

17
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.470
Let me say where.

18
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.950
Script name as number to work.

19
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.380
Number two,

20
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.480
Lord Dark.

21
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.750
Feeling nothing.

22
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.970
So guys,

23
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.490
first step,

24
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.880
ease.

25
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.450
Your skipper has to read some number.

26
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.850
Let me dick.

27
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.250
Input or number equals two.

28
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.430
See,

29
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.690
guys,

30
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.820
we are reading a number.

31
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.250
That's why you had to use a malfunction in your pipes on three in port,

32
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.500
then here,

33
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.230
simply right,

34
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.050
and everyone number right.

35
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.040
So after that,

36
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280
whatever you are entering the number,

37
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.750
you have to convert that number into work.

38
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620
Suppose let's say you are entering number one.

39
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.050
Then you were given number is one.

40
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.690
Then you want to print it in terms off words like when you won so directly.

41
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.210
I can't write in this way Print you are entering number one.

42
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.910
Suppose right.

43
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.050
So for that I can't write in this way or simply If your number is one right.

44
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.960
If your number is one that only how to print this one for anyone.

45
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.520
If your number is to learn how to print it a blow to let me write first bring to bring

46
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.040
three Let me write it for us.

47
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.150
So that a really good idea.

48
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.750
Four.

49
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.750
Bring fight.

50
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:28.550
Let me repeat it upto 10 six Bring seven eight mine Then let me print it Then that's it.

51
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.420
But if I run this script right,

52
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.750
let me run it first.

53
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.250
So our striptease number two word conversion.

54
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.650
Right?

55
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.750
So this is your script?

56
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.850
No,

57
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.090
you fire under what is happening Because off very first line You're Skippy is going toe.

58
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.650
Ask end everyone number.

59
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.950
Let me do that.

60
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.600
Enter your number.

61
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.210
Suppose I'm wondering number two.

62
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.230
So if I end up number two,

63
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.730
he has to display only to But you were stripped.

64
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.050
Whatever you have as off now that is going toe.

65
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.290
Bring the 123456789 and 10.

66
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.980
This is not correct.

67
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.740
If you're given,

68
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.660
number is two,

69
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.650
then you're toe print only two.

70
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.450
That means you're to take a decision before going to print your statement.

71
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.840
Right.

72
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.000
So you know how you can take a decision?

73
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.150
You can take a decision using conditional statements.

74
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.280
That's why what I'm doing is I am writing if number if it is equals to one,

75
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.950
then I want to print this line.

76
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.750
That's it.

77
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.000
Some way.

78
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.840
If number it goes to cool,

79
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.550
then I want to print this line.

80
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.660
Likewise.

81
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.890
Let me repeat up to if number it cost to three.

82
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.400
Then I want to print three.

83
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.020
Right,

84
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.350
So there's now I'm using.

85
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.900
Ah,

86
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.360
very simple if condition.

87
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.850
Because you can write your logic in anyways.

88
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.130
But while writing yeah,

89
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.970
do write some effect too.

90
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.010
Oh,

91
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.580
script.

92
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.580
What timing?

93
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.150
I'm writing simple way using your simple If condition.

94
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.050
I will also show you some effective script to implement this logic.

95
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.740
Let me do it.

96
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:31.650
Let me do it up to nine.

97
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.660
Then finally you have 10 right?

98
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.950
See that number because to 10 that's it now warned Runny was scraped right.

99
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.890
Other than under any number five.

100
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.180
You're getting only fight then One.

101
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.980
You're getting one.

102
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.400
See that?

103
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.400
It's working perfectly.

104
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.780
Right?

105
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.350
So has off.

106
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.540
Know what I would just give to you?

107
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.490
How that is working perfectly,

108
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.390
but same script by June,

109
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.450
That same script.

110
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.950
I'm running by property by providing a number called Tool.

111
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.680
No,

112
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.350
you're not getting in output night.

113
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.830
So if you're enter number is 1 to 10 range,

114
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.350
then only you're going to display.

115
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.280
So that's what you want to mention in your script.

116
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.410
So I'm wondering.

117
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:32.010
Enter your number under any number and bet any number between Oneto 10 range Okay for

118
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.600
timing will keep this missile as in this way.

119
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.030
No,

120
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.350
If you run your script yes,

121
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.500
you are observing Enter any number between onto Ray onto 10 trains.

122
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.760
You know,

123
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.750
I'm wondering Supposed three.

124
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.020
Yes,

125
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.790
you are getting But even though if you're displaying,

126
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.630
enter a number between 1 to 10 drained by mistake.

127
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.500
I enter 11.

128
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.260
No,

129
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.050
you're getting you're not getting in airport.

130
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.420
That's why what I'm doing is,

131
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.760
if any number not in the given range Oneto tend range.

132
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.350
I want to display like I wonder display like your number is out off range number.

133
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.510
That's why I'm running one more if condition are their name.

134
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.360
Ive number Not in it.

135
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:23.080
Remember that our membership operators not in one comer took a modicum of 456789 on than 10

136
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.750
range.

137
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.830
Then I can see bring.

138
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.750
They were number is off range.

139
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:40.550
Please select between Oneto tend range.

140
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.320
That's a by mistake if we aren't any number other than 1 to 10 range.

141
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.450
So guys faster for you ought to know what is a membership operated here.

142
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.720
See,

143
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.280
when this condition result,

144
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.250
when this expression result will become true means let's say you are an bring number 11

145
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.100
then 11 not in this range,

146
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.390
right?

147
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.500
That's what we are checking.

148
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.070
If 11 is not in this range than this expression will become true then you are excluding

149
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.550
this line.

150
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.380
Let's say it them then and not in this range No then already is there.

151
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.360
But you're taking for Not that way.

152
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.870
If 10 is the number,

153
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.680
then you will get this as a false reserved.

154
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:26.700
That's why you're not excluding this like so there is a simple way to use you were Ah if

155
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.150
condition for this requirement.

156
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.370
But here there is a disadvantage off course.

157
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.850
Your court is perfectly correct.

158
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.450
It will work for your number.

159
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.090
I mean,

160
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.850
if any number you're going to under between 1 to 10 range.

161
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.890
But here problem is first,

162
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.990
let me explain with let us assume you were given number.

163
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.940
He calls to one.

164
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.150
Then what will happen?

165
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.270
It's even know what if you run?

166
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.350
It was keeping legs good from top down because our very first line,

167
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.770
your skip,

168
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.510
is asking Enter your number between 1 to 10 range.

169
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.180
Suppose I'm entering one.

170
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.480
Then this one will go in the store and you're numb.

171
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.050
Variable.

172
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.000
Right.

173
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.490
So after the in second line,

174
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.610
you have ive condition.

175
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.080
So if number cost one Yes,

176
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.240
our number is one and we are taking with one.

177
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.780
This is true?

178
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.050
No.

179
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.780
Then you're printing this.

180
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:24.730
Then your first of condition expression is true on your printing where anyone that is over

181
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:24.730
.

182
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.980
Then immediately or python will go and check next to condition as well.

183
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.780
Because all are in your belief conditions.

184
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.540
There is no relation between anyone off.

185
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.570
You've condition here All our separate blocks,

186
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.550
separate rooms.

187
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:42.180
That's why your fight on rewarding check with secondly fastball number is one,

188
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.050
but we're checking with two when it closer to no false.

189
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.700
Likewise,

190
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.210
all conditions are false.

191
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.400
But we know that if number request one,

192
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.310
why should recheck initially all these conditions and everybody for all our falls.

193
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.380
If your number he cost one even though,

194
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.850
if you know Marie coast one unnecessarily or checking all these conditions because all are

195
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.550
separated conditions.

196
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:13.310
If you remember we how if else if condition what is the users off uses off?

197
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.020
That I think,

198
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:21.480
is that if I add in this way else if then then entire if weighs one of conditionally this

199
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.850
entire Lhasa case one if condition on lead,

200
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.040
let me at it first else.

201
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:33.250
If then I will explain so not the meaningful disease.

202
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.780
You have only one condition.

203
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.550
This entire thing is like one of condition Now,

204
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.430
previously all are separated conditions.

205
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.450
There is no relation between anyone off the between any two off your if conditions

206
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.080
previously.

207
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.710
But now this anti from 2 to 23rd line entire thing is one of condition.

208
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.550
But this is if else if condition know how it will work.

209
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.820
See,

210
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:03.900
because off by adding else if you are all If conditions are treating as a one of

211
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.390
conditioned by your fight on.

212
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.730
Then what is that?

213
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.250
One days By writing in this way,

214
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.610
he's let me explain with the same number as one.

215
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:18.320
If somebody calls toe one what will happen first If by the for your vital will check this

216
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.540
if condition not because one Yes,

217
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:20.910
true.

218
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.070
If it is true,

219
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.920
your python will exclude this line.

220
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.350
You were if we Lalo to exclude this line,

221
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.050
I leave anyone off the condition.

222
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.960
You're faster condition self.

223
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.160
It is a true that's why by the four your python is going to skip all these conditions

224
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.850
without checking.

225
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:44.190
That is the at one days If you club all your if conditions so that you're going to stay the

226
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.340
execution time right on Nestle are not going to check the many conditions.

227
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.350
If very first condition is true,

228
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.810
then definitely we know that remaining all are false.

229
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.300
Why should we go and check them?

230
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.980
Soto,

231
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.330
aware that you have to write your all conditions all if conditions has a one of condition

232
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:07.290
So that is possible by writing in this way if as if as if also false if else If this entire

233
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.950
thing is no one of condition.

234
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.530
No,

235
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.300
Let me explain it.

236
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.180
Some other number.

237
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.540
Let me take my input is three.

238
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.230
I'm providing input as three.

239
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.050
Then three is going to store your numb variable in this.

240
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:23.810
So while excluding for first line,

241
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.090
you're profiting Number three then first line exclusion off.

242
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.550
Your first ladies were now in your numb variable the value with street.

243
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.810
Then immediately or pattern will come to second line immediately.

244
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:41.350
Three close to one False because disease falls because disease falls.

245
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.540
That's why you're fightin coming toe next eve.

246
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.540
Condition next else if condition.

247
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.990
This is false.

248
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:55.640
That's why Python is coming to else if condition so number 33 closer to know falls again.

249
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.280
These are false.

250
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.960
That's why we have one more else.

251
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.080
If that's why you're right and it's coming to here and then it is taking here now because

252
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.490
the three yes,

253
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:03.950
it's true.

254
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.510
This is true.

255
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.980
You're fighting will execute.

256
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.260
I mean,

257
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.950
you're else if will allow to exclude this line.

258
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.530
So now this condition is true.

259
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.950
You are excluding this line.

260
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.960
So if condition is true,

261
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.990
then your pipeline will skip remaining all conditions whether they're true or false.

262
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:26.350
Your button won't take care if the first occurring condition is true.

263
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.060
Then remaining.

264
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.620
All conditions are going to skip without checking.

265
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.950
Right?

266
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:39.750
So this is the odd one days by clubbing your multiple if conditions right.

267
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.360
So I think this is fine now.

268
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.120
Here also,

269
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.720
I can reduce one more else of condition.

270
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.450
Guys,

271
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.250
just agenda al gender,

272
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:56.180
this condition 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th and 10.

273
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.950
If all our falls then what is the meaning for that?

274
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.230
Definitely Or number is not equals to one or two or three or four or five or six or seven

275
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.450
or eight or nine or 10.

276
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.350
Your number is out off 10 range.

277
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.780
So why should we check this?

278
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.130
If all conditions are false by default,

279
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.250
we can say that number is out of range.

280
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.420
That way we thought,

281
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:24.080
writing your else if simply you confide in place off this line simply else you can write it

282
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.050
else you can write it if you want to keep it as else.

283
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.030
If not your number not in group off values noble.

284
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.650
That's fine.

285
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.420
But we know that if all first it and conditions are false,

286
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.310
means definitely your number is not in the range of 1 to 10.

287
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.690
Then no need to check condition again.

288
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.940
Dad,

289
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.740
look and say that if all other conditions are false,

290
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.410
then you can say that number is out of frame.

291
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.350
Please select between 1 to 10 range,

292
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.050
right?

293
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.720
So,

294
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.900
guys,

295
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.350
the else is your optional.

296
00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:02.260
So you have to remember that when else will exclude mint If all about conditions are false

297
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.260
,

298
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.000
then only where else will execute.

299
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.330
Otherwise it won't x cured right on the hard to remember one more thing while excluding

300
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:15.020
your if else if condition If any one of the condition is true,

301
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.250
then you're fightin will exclude the lines which are there under that particular.

302
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.470
If condition on remaining all will skip,

303
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.650
all will skip.

304
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.970
They won't exclude.

305
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.300
They won't even touch by your python.

306
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.000
So in this way you're going to save your execution time,

307
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.850
right?

308
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.950
Fine on gays.

309
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:37.910
If it is fine,

310
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.740
Better Tok here also there is the one beside one dish.

311
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.850
What is that?

312
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.500
First of all,

313
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.460
let me x Goodison show you the result.

314
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:54.350
I'm going to exclude it,

315
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.470
right?

316
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.950
Sorry.

317
00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:09.200
Not that I'm and brings up was let's say four.

318
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.070
Yes,

319
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.180
you're getting for now,

320
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.930
I'm wondering some number 34.

321
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.790
So your number out of fringe,

322
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.850
please select between 1 to 10 range.

323
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.230
Right.

324
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.150
Fine case as off.

325
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.380
No,

326
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.180
this script is also perfectly correct.

327
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:30.980
But if your number is out off in how your execution is happening,

328
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.950
just check it once.

329
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.220
So let us assume your number.

330
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:35.880
Variable.

331
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.410
I mean,

332
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.490
from common lane for this line,

333
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.180
you're providing number as some tools.

334
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.450
If it is tool right,

335
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:50.160
how your python is going to excuse your defense condition from top down immediately after

336
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.220
reading your number,

337
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.350
fighting is coming to your festive condition.

338
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.980
So it is going toe Very fight you are given.

339
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.670
Number is equals to one No fault.

340
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.380
So disease falls.

341
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.660
That's why your pardon is coming to next else if nobody calls to do no false,

342
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:09.670
then again your pattern will go the next else If number cause today no falls again,

343
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.530
it will go to next.

344
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:17.390
Like what is it is coming to last then suppose here number because it in?

345
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:17.730
No,

346
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:18.570
because your numbers too.

347
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.310
Well then,

348
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:24.500
next your python is trying to exclude next else if or else condition,

349
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.230
But as off No.

350
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.830
If it is else.

351
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.920
You don't have any condition.

352
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.930
If you don't have any condition by default,

353
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:34.830
this land will excuse so that he for all our false then only by the four your last line

354
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.450
will exclude.

355
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.170
Yes,

356
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.320
in this rate is working.

357
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.230
No,

358
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.150
I have it idea.

359
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.630
That is so.

360
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:48.780
If number is out off 10 range than not necessarily are checking all these conditions,

361
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.150
right?

362
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.440
All these conditions then you are deciding.

363
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.760
Number is also French.

364
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.720
After verifying all these conditions After that,

365
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.950
only you are deciding your number is also fringe.

366
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.470
That's why what I'm doing is cedar.

367
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.030
I'm writing one at once.

368
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.060
Freeway this escape.

369
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.700
Let me come in.

370
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.160
This one.

371
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.260
And I think Thank.

372
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.180
Just assume you're reading a number.

373
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.400
So I'm going to come in this life.

374
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.120
So I will write once again that line at last,

375
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.500
Sergeant,

376
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.460
that you come into your previous the script.

377
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.090
Now we're going to write new script in the same program,

378
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.450
right?

379
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.050
I am reading a number.

380
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.270
The very first itself.

381
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.900
I'm checking.

382
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.780
That is,

383
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:44.520
if if your number not in the range off 12345678 nine Other than 10 then if it is not.

384
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.320
Then if it is not in the rage,

385
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.610
Otherwise I will check it.

386
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.950
If your number in this range in this range,

387
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.450
then all I will try to convert your number in the world.

388
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.710
Right.

389
00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:03.450
So here I would like the lousy con working your number indoor work.

390
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:09.280
But I'm not writing that logic will see it else means where else will execute.

391
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.570
If your number is not in the given range,

392
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.020
then only else will execute.

393
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.000
Then I can say out off range number.

394
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.760
Please select 1 to 10 range.

395
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.350
That's it.

396
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:31.140
A year Simple simple thing is just assume you're entering number as tool.

397
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.100
So previously whenever if we enter number two Well,

398
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.510
you are taking 10 conditions.

399
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.180
After that,

400
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.350
you are very fucking cool is not out off Italy's out off range number.

401
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.350
See your days previously If number is too well,

402
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.790
first of all,

403
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.610
you're taking all these conditions.

404
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.630
Then you are deciding number is out of fringe.

405
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.280
But know what I'm doing is foster which self I am trying to check.

406
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.050
Whether given number is there in the list off.

407
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.050
10 numbers are not.

408
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.960
If it is there,

409
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.160
then I will try to write a logic yet Book on what they were number in the world.

410
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:10.760
In case if this is false means your number is not in the given range off values.

411
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.850
That's why else back is going to execute its very simple No.

412
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.550
Only with two steps you are deciding whether number is valid number or not.

413
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.950
But in previous,

414
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:26.550
you are deciding a number is not valid number after taking 10 conditions.

415
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.400
So unless we are going toe,

416
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.160
waste your execution time,

417
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.190
right?

418
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.500
But here you're saving that.

419
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.260
Let me do that.

420
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.180
I mean,

421
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.760
let me excuse your court fight on number toward conversion.

422
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.770
I'm wondering number 45.

423
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.990
You're getting number out off range,

424
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.280
please.

425
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.350
Number between 1 to 10 range.

426
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.020
Right now.

427
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.160
I am wondering suppose three.

428
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.250
Did we say all this?

429
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.240
I'm not sure.

430
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.890
Let me save it.

431
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.950
Yeah.

432
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.950
No,

433
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.650
let me do 45 number out off ranging number,

434
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.450
please select 1 to 10 range.

435
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.340
No,

436
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.530
I'm giving a valid number.

437
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:12.540
Suppose but between 1 to 10 range number four can working your number into work.

438
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.260
But you have to write logic there to convert their number into four.

439
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.150
If it is a valid number already We have a logic to convert that right already we have a

440
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.850
logic to convert that so one out of two is no No.

441
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:29.290
Instead offering Stedman inside off your if condition,

442
00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:34.510
I'll be right one more if condition because directly if number is a valid number Apparently

443
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.660
I can't say that it is a one.

444
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.050
It is a two.

445
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.680
It is a three,

446
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.970
right Are getting one.

447
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.760
How to do see that?

448
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.450
Bring one.

449
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:49.490
But when the I want to print this one if if Gay Sam writing inside If one motive if you are

450
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.350
number is equals to one,

451
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.260
that's it.

452
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.000
So inside off that ive conditioning or dried print one.

453
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.290
So I just tried toe exclude If you don't do space here,

454
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:01.810
what will happen?

455
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.050
You just right So that you can understand Why should we give space?

456
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.720
First of all,

457
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.590
this is mainly of condition With this you're violating whether given number is there in the

458
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.660
given range off values or not?

459
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.460
If it is in the range off values then it's like in this way guys,

460
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.110
just assume you have it.

461
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.760
You water house.

462
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.620
This is main door once.

463
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.850
If we under in the main door.

464
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:30.620
There are some rooms again you re enter into this room.

465
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.980
So to enter into this room are going to have a key.

466
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.800
You should have a key.

467
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.950
That's what we're doing here.

468
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.810
First I'm taking whether I am Linda in this group are not?

469
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:40.400
Yes,

470
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.420
I have a key for my main room.

471
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.760
Main home?

472
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.130
Yes,

473
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.450
I'm entering after enduring based on your number.

474
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.360
If it is one of your toe print one If it is to your toe printer to right.

475
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.270
That's why what I'm doing is Dallas.

476
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.320
If if somebody calls to to then printed to,

477
00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.550
like crazy just complete upto,

478
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.340
then I'm not writing up Good.

479
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.680
Then you can write it like so.

480
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.320
If you want,

481
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.370
I can do it so likewise.

482
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.510
You ought to write up to 10 days.

483
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.110
You just have tried to practice in that way.

484
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.440
That's it,

485
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.970
right.

486
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.120
Liberated here also how to provide.

487
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.530
I have to give one important point.

488
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.450
Let me write it.

489
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:29.600
Sorry.

490
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.660
So,

491
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:31.920
guys,

492
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.170
well,

493
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.460
writing your python scripts,

494
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.010
indentation or providing space is very,

495
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.760
very important.

496
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:58.050
Goldman 26 What can let me write it else?

497
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:05.660
If if number because to eight bring eight.

498
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:17.200
I'll see if if number it close to mine print my then I had to write once again.

499
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.760
Right?

500
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.840
You're else.

501
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.090
If if number coastal,

502
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.050
pen spring,

503
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.100
then Yes.

504
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.290
This is perfectly correct.

505
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:26.820
It will work.

506
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.420
Definitely.

507
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:27.820
Okay,

508
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.480
let me go on.

509
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:28.900
Right.

510
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.840
I'm wanting number 48.

511
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.940
You're getting old for date.

512
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.170
If I under any number out of friends you're getting out off range number,

513
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.520
please select 1 to 10 trains.

514
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.160
That is fine.

515
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.510
Not this script.

516
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.220
Combat your all previous scripts.

517
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.660
This is somewhat enhances script.

518
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.160
But guess if you observe when you are entering into your for Steve condition,

519
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.700
are you not in your first of condition?

520
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.310
This is a room.

521
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:56.480
So you are entering into this room.

522
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.050
If your number is there in in this list off values,

523
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.690
right.

524
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.590
Let's say you are entering number called 10.

525
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.890
Yes,

526
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:07.770
10 is there in the list.

527
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:10.780
That's where you are able to enter into this room after entering into this room.

528
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.540
If number is,

529
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.630
tell your toe printed 10.

530
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:17.050
That's why this is if else if condition you're biting will check for Steve condition.

531
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:17.770
Right,

532
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.860
but by ton will check for Steve condition.

533
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.350
Your property number is 10 then equals to one No,

534
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.790
false.

535
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.950
That's why I'm fighting gum and check this one.

536
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.450
Nobody calls to know false then like ways.

537
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.540
One of those you number cost nine No falls.

538
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.770
Then come here.

539
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.620
Number because attend.

540
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:35.910
Yes,

541
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:43.960
you are printing so they If all these conditions or false up to nine then definitely or

542
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.310
river remaining number is generally right Because for stuff while you were able to enter

543
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.990
into this,

544
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:55.060
if you're number within this range 1 to 10 and if you're 1st 9 conditions are false than by

545
00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.970
default to the last number is if foster nine conditions are false Then definitely you can

546
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.490
say number is 10 then known.

547
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.450
Check this last condition.

548
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.440
Of course,

549
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.080
if you write in this way,

550
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.160
that is perfectly correct.

551
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.970
But what I'm saying,

552
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.000
if all these nine conditions are falls,

553
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.780
then definitely your number is 10.

554
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.960
There is no doubt in there.

555
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.390
That's why that's why what I'm doing.

556
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.230
I'm not checking.

557
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.830
I'm not checking simply,

558
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.180
I'm writing else block.

559
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.310
That is good,

560
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.760
actually.

561
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.940
So you know when else will exclude if all about conditions are false,

562
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.450
then only it will exclude.

563
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.670
We know that if all our falls then definitely.

564
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.340
Number is 10.

565
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.550
That's where I'm printing 10.

566
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.480
That's a right.

567
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.110
See that?

568
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.320
It will work perfectly.

569
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.850
Let me under number 10.

570
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.950
Yes.

571
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.710
Let me under number some 23 are some four.

572
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.550
It's working right?

573
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.880
Flying still How very,

574
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.850
very useful.

575
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.000
Vale Frightening for this.

576
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.390
Quite me.

577
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:06.760
Still How one more enhanced way to write this script.

578
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.080
Maybe you may not get that idea as off.

579
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.300
No,

580
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.330
but once if you see.

581
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:12.300
But nobody forget.

582
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.710
That type of situations definitely will get this area.

583
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.760
So what is that?

584
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.460
I see.

585
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.160
What is that?

586
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.260
Let me come in this gold first.

587
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.440
See now,

588
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.880
as I have no to display a number 1 to 10 range.

589
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.220
How many lines you're writing?

590
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:33.390
So from 27 to almost let me daily them the lines.

591
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:33.990
50

592
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:38.050
That means almost off 27 lines.

593
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.400
Your writing to display simply your number.

594
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.760
Our numbers from 1 to 10 range.

595
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.570
But what I'm doing is one second.

596
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.160
I'm going to come in the score days.

597
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.050
See that what I'm doing first of all,

598
00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.340
before going to really one number Or maybe after reading your number.

599
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.920
No problem.

600
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.810
The first thing is you should read some number from your input.

601
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.010
Yes.

602
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.370
Support.

603
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.700
Assume that I am reading my number.

604
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.850
After that,

605
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.200
I am offer that I am defining my dick.

606
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.850
Steady gaze,

607
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.380
My one big study.

608
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.880
So what is the big story?

609
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.530
How your dictionary will be there.

610
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.610
We know that it dick study will How key value pair representation.

611
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.690
So no,

612
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.720
I am defending my dick.

613
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:25.710
Study in this way our number two world conversion victory equals two dexterity.

614
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.950
Should be always with curly braces on with key value pair representations.

615
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:35.890
So I'm taking Kia's win number one on its value s where anyone So that is one key value

616
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.900
pair representation.

617
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:45.260
Let me take 2nd 1 then 3rd 1 Yes.

618
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.630
If you go through this I mean this lousy current logic.

619
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:56.810
Then you'll feel true because it's very nice one and it's very useful one.

620
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.270
Just after this,

621
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:06.580
let me force to create my dictionary with 1 to 10 as keys on values as words 1 to 10 right

622
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:06.580
.

623
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.450
That's what I'm writing here six then of midnight seven.

624
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.760
So there's this concept is very,

625
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.880
very useful in your real time as well.

626
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880
So,

627
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.440
while writing or real time scripts,

628
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.120
you will come to know the importance off defining your dictionary with Cuba.

629
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.590
Lupe Representations.

630
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:30.560
One second.

631
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.060
The last one is stand right?

632
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.450
Yeah,

633
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:38.100
right.

634
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.050
Fine.

635
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.830
No,

636
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:46.100
I assume that you are by running this skip What will happen Because our 54 line you're

637
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:46.950
reading a number,

638
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.550
you will live some number.

639
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.390
First of all,

640
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.260
I'm evaluating whether number is a valid number or not.

641
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:59.760
If number in 123456789 spin,

642
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.800
then then then I can say bring valid number.

643
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.460
First of all admitted rallied number If it is not in the given range than I can say,

644
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.840
Please enter.

645
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:24.850
Your number is always you are Number is out off range Please select someone to 10 range

646
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.550
Nothing.

647
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.550
So guys here previously toe can What?

648
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:35.200
Your number in tow word your writing some if else If else If conditions But no,

649
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.270
I'm not writing there because I have a dick study in my dictionary I have a key and value

650
00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.370
paid representation.

651
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.160
Now what I'm doing is simply I'm printing my big story.

652
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:52.800
My dick study Don't get dot Get You were key.

653
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.660
Whatever the number you are providing that number I'm placing here.

654
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.130
No before running this cape.

655
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:03.890
Let me select this one and I'm going toe fight on terminal date.

656
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.350
I will show you first so that you can easily in this time this is my dig.

657
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.540
Sorry,

658
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:07.950
guys.

659
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.760
Number work.

660
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.050
Get embroiling.

661
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.800
Right.

662
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.140
I'm promoting one.

663
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:17.950
See the result?

664
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.660
What I'm taking to see the result.

665
00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.070
No.

666
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.980
Whatever the input you're providing,

667
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.850
that is a number,

668
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.070
right?

669
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.070
So no one I'm doing is based on your import.

670
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.160
I'm selecting a key value from my dictionary.

671
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.710
So you may under one.

672
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.950
If we under one get one.

673
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.860
What is the one value?

674
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.570
Where anyone.

675
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.650
That's what we are displaying.

676
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.680
It's very simple one,

677
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:42.950
right?

678
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:48.260
Let me save it and run it and see the magic.

679
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.390
First of all,

680
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:51.930
let me weapon.

681
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.660
He was script.

682
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.620
See the last length,

683
00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:01.540
the only we have 123456 lanes inch off 27 lines.

684
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.260
Now we have only six lines.

685
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.600
Let me remove some empty lanes.

686
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.160
Here,

687
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:12.910
let me say on Let me re open you r script here.

688
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.920
Right?

689
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.100
So this is your skip today's No.

690
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.010
Let me run it first You're number.

691
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.050
The word I'm an things up was four.

692
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:26.770
You're getting all put for more See what will happen but never if you enter number.

693
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:27.610
As for that,

694
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.760
four is going to store in your number able Fine.

695
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.870
You are checking if anyone This is just defending your variable value.

696
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.220
Right dictionary there.

697
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.510
After that,

698
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:41.620
your partner will come and exclude this one Numb 44 in this rain Yes,

699
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.610
if it is in this range one regarding print num word from your dictionary.

700
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.280
A key key one with that key.

701
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.010
What is the value?

702
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.100
That's what we are printing.

703
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.240
No monitor Take.

704
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.550
You felt condition also here,

705
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.760
right?

706
00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.880
So guys try to understand this simple magic.

707
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.450
It's very useful in your real time.

708
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.450
Okay,

709
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.370
Okay.

710
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.840
Okay,

711
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.240
guys,

712
00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.850
Thank you for watching this video.
