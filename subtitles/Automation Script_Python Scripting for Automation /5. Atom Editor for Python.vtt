You can use anyone off the editor.

95
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.160
So most of the cases I will use sublime checks,

96
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.450

98
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.630
But whereas in sublime you can download and install.

99
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.170
But it you need a license to activate the full washing off your sublime text that please

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.890
that So if you're such with the script,

187
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.170
you will get this escape run called in eight pm on.

188
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.070
Then you will see here option like this one.

189
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.070
Install right.

190
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.430
My heart.

191
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.130
But I already installed that.

192
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.350
That's why it is able to show that certain things uninstalling disabled,

193
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.500
right?

194
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.560
Somebody If I disable this,

195
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.550
that means as in that there is no script package with my atrium Edita right now.

196
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.410
If I try to run,

197
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.530
see that you won't get in output.

198
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.350
Now you're Skip Condon.

199
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.090
So not only for your fight on if you want to run.

200
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:46.650
Any type off script which was supported by you are a beom to run that strip.

201
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.370
First of all,

202
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.550
you need to install a package called Script.

203
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.550
So just select install and then come here.

204
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.850
Such for the script of package.

205
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.850
Right?

206
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.930
Reality.

207
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.450
It was there with my host.

208
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.930
That's why just I'm enabling enable.

209
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.610
If it is not that I will get uptown like install yard install.

210
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.570
It will take some time,

211
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:07.950
guys.

212
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.560
Nearly 2 to 3 minutes to retake.

213
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.750
To install you are skipped a package.

214
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.070
So what is the use off?

215
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:18.840
This package means this package will automatically identify the bite on abortion,

216
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.020
which is dead on your operating system.

217
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.740
Whatever the fight on Western,

218
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:29.290
you install on your operating system that python will be sick for your eight pia mater to

219
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.760
run your python scripts on your way to a murder is going toe.

220
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.400
Identify your python based on your environment variables if you remember while installing

221
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.340
or bite on.

222
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:49.880
We set some an internment variable or part for your PC by selecting properties are doing

223
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.840
system settings.

224
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.630
Then in environment variables,

225
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.350
we have apart and eat it.

226
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.640
See that fight on 37?

227
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.490
Washington was selector for your operating system.

228
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.600
The same python will be used by your age.

229
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.590
Lemaitre with help off script A package nothing.

230
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:12.280
Is there guys once if you install it were atrium simply goto file then certain things and

231
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:19.490
then goto install and then such a package called script and then it will display its script

232
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.490
.

233
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.810
A pack is something like this script.

234
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.950
Some Washington run courting atrium just installed that right?

235
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.070
So after that,

236
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.370
just select Europe I transcript by clicking on numerator.

237
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:39.370
Then press on your keyboard control shift and then be now it is going to run.

238
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.430
See the output in the below.

239
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.950
You're getting your output here,

240
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.270
right?

241
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.090
So what is the point on Washington?

242
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.150
This 80 a murder is using.

243
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.200
So as of now,

244
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.480
you don't know about modules,

245
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.920
right?

246
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.110
There is a model called states with your fight on using that,

247
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.750
you can able to find out the washing off your python which is run in your pipe on court.

248
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.300
Right?

249
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:00.920
Let me run it.

250
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.650
Candles shift to be so that would put $3.7 dollars.

251
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.110
Zero in case if you modify.

252
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:13.360
If you modify you were part to do some other washing off your python here automatically

253
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.470
that Brighton will be used by your atrium editor.

254
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.150
That's it,

255
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.090
Right,

256
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.150
Fine.

257
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.910
So after installing you escape after testing your pie transcript whether it is running

258
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.660
successfully or not,

259
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.570
just close it right.

260
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:30.530
Ck's once.

261
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.800
If we install your bite on,

262
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.320
you may get some shot.

263
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.140
Good for you were a teammate on your desktop.

264
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.650
If it is not just to click your start,

265
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.230
so see here you will see some eight pm editor.

266
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.350
Just click on that,

267
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.990
then it will open.

268
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.660
You are eight pm editor,

269
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.060
but you're going toe open.

270
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.340
You are area mater.

271
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.850
Yes,

272
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.550
it's opening.

273
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.060
Right.

274
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.170
So suppose if you already some pie transcripts on if you want to,

275
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.850
we run those bite on skips using your area.

276
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.410
Mater,

277
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.350
you have an option called file.

278
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.990
Just set up your folder open.

279
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.450
Fuller said like that.

280
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.710
In which location?

281
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.910
How Your python scripts.

282
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.350
Let me go with one of the location.

283
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.850
Sorry.

284
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.850

No,

288
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.330
Inside that engaging from any python scripts.

289
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.150
All those kids are going to weapon here.

290
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.250
Not really What he will do.

291
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.890
See there.

292
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.070
Let me select some of the python script called.

293
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.250
Suppose this one.

294
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.950
Just don't Vikander,

295
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.890
you're going to get your bite on Skippy here,

296
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:57.480
Then click there and then control shift to be right now you're going to get your output

297
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:57.950
here.

298
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:03.770
Do that in Berlin,

299
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.420
Index.

300
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.670
Yeah.

301
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.500
Maybe this is by tawn three,

302
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:07.780
right?

303
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.050
I'm using maybe bite on 3 13 line.

304
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:10.880
Yeah.

305
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.670
So here I need a parent.

306
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:19.750
Is this year civic and then run it condole shift to be Yes.

307
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.650
You got your output,

308
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.080
right?

309
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.660
Nothing.

310
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.030
So,

311
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.300
guys,

312
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.070
after installing you are a two year mater What your next step is?

313
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.490
If you want to change some teams,

314
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.140
you can change it,

315
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:40.640
but not enough that apparently can use default teams Then install script the package on a

316
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.750
war atrium.

317
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.580
So how be installed?

318
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.800
This if installed,

319
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.270
is then only it were host to fight on.

320
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:52.300
Software will be identified by your 8 p.m. On the court in your atrium will be run by that

321
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.580
fight on software in your area.

322
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.050
Mater.

323
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.590
So to install script A package right back.

324
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.950
His name is simply script days.

325
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:04.180
What you have to do is goto.

326
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.690
You would see that Fine.

327
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:15.950
Then select settings the lender select install.

328
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.450
Then you will get a such bar.

329
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.850
So it's such with the script.

330
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.180
Then you will get a script.

331
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.010
A package.

332
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.290
So there you have the option called install.

333
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.360
Just install it.

334
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.950
Nothing.

335
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.040
Then after that,

336
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.910
he just to close your atrium and then re weapon.

337
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:38.640
Right?

338
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.370
So one more thing once if he install you are a two year Meritor,

339
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.660
right automatically.

340
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.660
You may get short cut off your a t m on they were they stop.

341
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.540
If not,

342
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.450
no problem.

343
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:49.860
Just sell.

344
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.140
API will start and then click here so that he will go up.

345
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.260
Anyone atrium married up.

346
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:54.960
That's it,

347
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.980
right?

348
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.460
So,

349
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:57.690
guys,

350
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.420
going forward,

351
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.350
I may use most of the cases sublime texting because for presentation,

352
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.260
but was that is good,

353
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.360
right?

354
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.450
But you can practice your course using your atrium,

355
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:08.740
right,

356
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.510
and also I to right the core using via or via Mater,

357
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.000
and try to run your court from common line as Well,

358
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.880
right.

359
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.540
If you're looking for automation unit,

360
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.480
that is the best option,

361
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:20.850
actually,

362
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.300
for application development,

363
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.140
something like that.

364
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.570
Actually,

365
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:25.090
these geo,

366
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:25.870
it'll start good,

367
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.110
because for application dollar money No,

368
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.880
you'll have some number off folders.

369
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.430
