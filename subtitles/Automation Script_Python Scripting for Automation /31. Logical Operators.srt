1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
friends here.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,950
We're going to discuss about logical operators off.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,350
Fight on.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,310
Let me start there.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,260
See logical operators.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,640
Theological operators are useful toe.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,750
Combine multiple conditions.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,250
One of the multiple conditions.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,350
Let me take my fight on shell or fight on common line.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,060
Right.

11
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,170
See if I take three greater than one.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,450
This is one condition.

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:38,550
Our Let me take something like wanting this list false?

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,790
No.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,170
I want to come in these two for my partner Logic as if No,

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,420
don't worry about what is their last just after that.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:54,880
If I come in these two things three greater than one on right?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,850
You're letting someone put it may be false,

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,850
right?

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,850
So here I combine two conditions,

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,230
right,

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,560
Fine.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,830
So in this way,

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,250
just to combine multiple conditions So we are using logical operators night?

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,450
No,

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,680
in Europe Eitan,

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,850
you have different types off logical openers until they are three.

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,050
They are like find are and then not operators.

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,890
Right?

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,550
See that?

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,550
Let me go with one by one on.

32
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:37,800
See a new operator If you come by in multiple conditions with on a nobody returns Prue,

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,050
If both are all the conditions are true,

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,050
right?

35
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,650
See here as off?

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,000
No,

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,300
I combined two conditions.

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,850
This one and this one.

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,030
Okay,

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,210
so they see this easier.

41
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,890
Operator,

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,780
this is a one condition,

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,240
but finally this condition This is like a one value are one operation for your inoperative

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,130
the same way this entire thing is one condition.

45
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,980
But this is one open for the work.

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,150
Logical and operator.

47
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,900
Right for this operator you are giving to our parents,

48
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,220
you know,

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,980
in your really what is the result off this one And this one already we have seen through

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,350
and then false.

51
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,950
So if it club this too one false case with under operator what is already are getting false

52
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:24,950
.

53
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,390
Let me combine 34 conditions.

54
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,130
You can come in any number of conditions with your end operator.

55
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,240
Let me do one thing.

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,270
One less than two.

57
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,590
Yes,

58
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,090
it's true.

59
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,580
On to less than three.

60
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,830
Yes,

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,350
it's true.

62
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,150
On three less than four.

63
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,380
Yes,

64
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,860
it's true.

65
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,500
No,

66
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,470
I am combining three conditions with on the operator on did indeed relief.

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,610
You observe one less than two years.

68
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,860
It's true to less than three Pool three Less than four group No,

69
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,720
you Here I am combining three conditions and in Usually each and every condition is true in

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,510
the case.

71
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,650
If it club all the true conditions with your under operator result is also proof.

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,250
See,

73
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,650
that would put.

74
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,340
But if anyone off the condition is false,

75
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,830
let me take four less than three.

76
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,540
That is false low even though this one on this one is true.

77
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,950
But this is false.

78
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,260
No.

79
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,380
Whenever even club multiple conditions fun at that time.

80
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,080
If any one of the condition is false,

81
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,850
then result is also false.

82
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:38,590
Nice don't body when you're going to use this just after the operation How your Thunderbird

83
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,700
is working while walking with your If condition we will see effectively when we have to

84
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:52,750
select this logical operators upto that right just just observed the output Whenever a few

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,550
club multiple conditions with under operator what will happen,

86
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,850
right?

87
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,800
No,

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,350
the next one is or opening it returns Prue if either of the open.

89
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,150
So I feel that this meaning is whenever if your clubbing two conditions.

90
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,870
But using your order operator also,

91
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,440
you can club either to conditions or multiple conditions.

92
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,380
Let me do one thing one less than do oh,

93
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,550
three less than four result is true fasting.

94
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,060
Both are true like I don't know.

95
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,770
What I'm doing is one is Drew and one more is false for less than two false right?

96
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,250
But the reason is true.

97
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,840
That means while working with your our operator if anyone off the condition is true,

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,850
then dessert is true.

99
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:59,990
Be clear lace see while working with on operator right you anyone off the condition is

100
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:08,810
false then a reserve is also false then,

101
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,790
while working with the or operator If anyone off the condition is true,

102
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,150
then the result is also proof.

103
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,250
Be clear,

104
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,750
right plane?

105
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,680
No,

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,450
let me take one less than two.

107
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,990
It's too right.

108
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,690
It's true.

109
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,820
We know that know what I'm doing is true conditions.

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,120
I want to make it as a false Yes,

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,530
you can do with a smart operator.

112
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,430
See that actually,

113
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,280
one less than two result is true,

114
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,920
but that prove you're complimenting with help off,

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,730
not operator.

116
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,010
That means if you're having a true then you will get output as a false whenever.

117
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,250
If you're playing not operator,

118
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,360
Let me go this thing to less than one.

119
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,450
It's false low,

120
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,690
but I cannot play for this and not operator based on requirements,

121
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,360
right?

122
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,720
And see the output false here,

123
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,650
converting in tow.

124
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,450
Right.

125
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,150
So these are the three logical operators in your python?

126
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:19,330
Not not off through it will do false.

127
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,430
Oh,

128
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,050
not off falls it will you result us through.

129
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,200
So,

130
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,400
guys,

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,940
for time being just observed that how you can club multiple conditions with under and or

132
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:42,020
operator If you club your multiple conditions with they were and are our operator.

133
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,560
What is the result you're getting?

134
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,640
What is the rule?

135
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,150
To get value as true or false while are playing your logical operators?

136
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,750
Right,

137
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,350
Fine.

138
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,150
The letters are June Dart.

139
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,950
How some 10 conditions.

140
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,860
Let's a simply four conditions.

141
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,350
Other ways pool is done three,

142
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,600
four less than fight 12 then file is then six.

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,210
Let me read something,

144
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,750
right?

145
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,750
No,

146
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,420
If I want to club all this with on the operator Yes.

147
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,980
You can collaborate by writing between these two conditions simply or under operator.

148
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,780
Right guys here you have a small injury question.

149
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,450
What is that means my house up was one,

150
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:37,480
234 four conditions I want to club with suppose a the Anno printer or off our operators

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,220
Then how many logical aunts I can use here if you have four.

152
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,850
If you have four four conditions,

153
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:54,000
then you need four minus one and operators andare even.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,450
Maybe you can also use our operators.

155
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:03,750
That's a because one C,

156
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,370
you help photo operators.

157
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:05,650
Right?

158
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,350
34 conditions,

159
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,490
not a club you're using three four minus 13 That's what I'm saying.

160
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,750
Here,

161
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,350
you cannot play something for our patrols.

162
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,850
Right?

163
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,850
Fine.

164
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,410
No next thing.

165
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:29,110
Engine off writing and again and again as off know how only four conditions.

166
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,450
So your clubbing with suppose three under operators.

167
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,280
But just are you my house?

168
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,600
Um,

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,170
10 conditions I want to club with your unknown operative.

170
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,660
Yes,

171
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,300
mine on operatives you need,

172
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,950
You can club,

173
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,590
but there is a shortcut for that that is all.

174
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:59,130
All just to provide or all conditions in terms off a list inside off all Tulloch's done

175
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,450
three,

176
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,050
four less than fight filers,

177
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,750
then six,

178
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,550
then seven less than 10.

179
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,350
So that is always exactly questioned,

180
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,950
operator.

181
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,090
All is exactly all is equals to unknown Britta.

182
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,850
What's induct is different.

183
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,440
Under better you are including between two conditions are between your multiple conditions

184
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,440
,

185
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,350
but all you are taking all in this way.

186
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,040
Inside off your parentheses you are writing a list.

187
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,450
That list consists off your conditions as a value.

188
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,780
Right?

189
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,290
First,

190
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,100
let me do one thing.

191
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,390
I will check this result What?

192
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,790
You're getting right Because all our true you know,

193
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,470
in an operator if all conditions are true,

194
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,170
then only will get output as a true if any one of the conditions falls Result is also false

195
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,700
in your under operative both the same but by mistakes,

196
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,630
not by mistake.

197
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,850
I suppose if you have any one of the condition as false know if other seven greater than 10

198
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,650
That is false.

199
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:05,980
So 1st 3 conditions are true on one condition is false when it But if you are playing under

200
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,640
operator on your multiple conditions If one condition is falls,

201
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,150
that result is also false.

202
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:18,550
Sending you gonna play in your general and operator False,

203
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,040
right?

204
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,890
The same way you have for are also for our You have to take any if anyone off the if anyone

205
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:35,050
off the condition is proof than result is also true Nothing.

206
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,990
See some But I'm taking this as a false but no problem because this is our operator if

207
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,180
anyone off the condition is true,

208
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,450
result is also true.

209
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,550
All right,

210
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,590
then.

211
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,150
Here unit on this time.

212
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,160
And he is exactly close to your or operator,

213
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,250
right?

214
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,880
See,

215
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,100
guys,

216
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,670
under result off your final result whatever you're getting with help off and are are right

217
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,330
under,

218
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,690
you can also apply Not so if you're getting proof previously.

219
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,300
Now you're making that as a false.

220
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,550
That's what you're getting here,

221
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,350
right?

222
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,810
That's it.

223
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,690
Okay.

224
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,610
So guys,

225
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:20,290
here once again I'm telling you that Don't worry when you have to apply your end or or not

226
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,290
,

227
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:28,090
operators he had just learn only if he club multiple conditions with an what is the result

228
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,050
on what basis you're getting deserved.

229
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,290
Right?

230
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,050
So you know,

231
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:44,030
always the logical operators result is all parties always either true or false but our but

232
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,750
on one business you're getting this true or false.

233
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,990
So once again,

234
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:55,390
I am repartee whenever if he club multiple conditions with an to get the result as true,

235
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,750
the rule is all must be true then only will get output as it to.

236
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,750
If any one of the conditions falls,

237
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,030
then differently will get output as a false.

238
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,430
That is the rule of fine for our if any one of the country's rivers.

239
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,450
If any one of the condition is true,

240
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,750
desert is always true,

241
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,300
right?

242
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,350
So if all conditions are false,

243
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,780
then all you will get output as a falls in your operator.

244
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,670
See that?

245
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,650
Let me take three less than one That is false.

246
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,570
On how one more thing for less than one that is also false.

247
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,650
No result is false.

248
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,750
But if at least one condition is true.

249
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,950
Okay,

250
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,150
So this is all about zoological operators,

251
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,050
Mike.

252
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,120
So finally,

253
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,710
how you are not operative And he had to remember this all and any all is exactly Coast

254
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,210
warned.

255
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,280
And he's exactly caused to our right.

256
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,390
So when you will take this one means any and all but number if you're multiple conditions

257
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,850
internal fighting you're under operator are operated repeatedly.

258
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,450
Right out of that time you will take a the all or any based on your requirements.

259
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,050
Right.

260
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,790
Okay.

261
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,110
Thank you for watching this video
