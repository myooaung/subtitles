ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
prince here.

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.650
We're going to discuss aboard Get past module.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.650
See this Get post model consist off two important functions they are Get pass and get user

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.790
See another if you want to see what are there?

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.860
Different functions are there with your model.

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.750
What you're to do simply first entered into your python.

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.250
Then why do you import that model?

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.090
Get past.

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.830
But I'm giving some Ah wrong Model him.

10
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.150
Get past for something.

11
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.680
See that what you're getting in or put us model not phone at a no model name called You are

12
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.780
get past Because not only this if any model is not presented with the order Biden's off

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.830
Very really throw this error right?

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.580
If this model is that they don't want you any other then immediately we know that we can

15
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.720
run Get pass the air of that so that it is going to released all they were functions and

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.520
variables which are dairy with your model.

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.190
But if we other here there are two models to functions with this they are like get past and

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.640
get user.

19
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.210
These are very,

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.250
very important from this Get model,

21
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.050
right?

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.610
See there then what is the uses of get bus.

23
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.720
See,

24
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.220
generally to read some string we're using input syntax in your fight on on with input

25
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.250
syntax,

26
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.140
whatever you're typing on your common line.

27
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.500
I mean,

28
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.650
while providing input it is displaying on your terminal.

29
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.350
Let me write Simple by done school first.

30
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.960
My intention is I want to read a password.

31
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.450
Read boss work.

32
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.220
Right for that,

33
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.850
I am going to write a simple python script.

34
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.050
Be clear here.

35
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.550
My intention is I want to read a password.

36
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.490
So you know that whenever if you're reading a password issue while typing that password on

37
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.350
your common lane,

38
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.860
if you don't display,

39
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.580
then that is good,

40
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.750
right?

41
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.370
First of all,

42
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.420
let me one day my password or some DB.

43
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.760
Plus what?

44
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.450
I'm taking database parts.

45
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.250
What he calls to input.

46
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.700
Enter your password.

47
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.690
Right.

48
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.090
Let me save it and run it.

49
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.770
So I'm going to run this strip really past Darby.

50
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.050
Wait.

51
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.680
Enter your password.

52
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.230
I mentoring support some password,

53
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.650
db 123 password.

54
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.450
So actually produce buzzword.

55
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.280
Try to a wide displaying your password while typing on your common land.

56
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.650
Then that is a good practice.

57
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.380
But with your normal input syntax,

58
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.350
you can't do that,

59
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.920
right?

60
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.790
That's why what I'm doing is see that one.

61
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.250
I'm going.

62
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.750
I'm going to import the model cord.

63
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.590
Let me come in this line.

64
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.670
Our noble unjust delegate Try to import for us to get past model.

65
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.110
Then I'm going to read Devi password first up there.

66
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.360
There.

67
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.330
Cool.

68
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.650
Get past dot Get bus,

69
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.440
right,

70
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.850
That's it.

71
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.550
Mostly there.

72
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.650
I'm going to run this script,

73
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.950
right.

74
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.050
Let me run it.

75
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.240
I'm running cities asking by default password as the prompt.

76
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.430
But I'm typing here.

77
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.400
You are not able to see that done so whatever you're typing and guess if you want to see

78
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.930
just for verification just for your edification After reading just I do printed act so that

79
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.250
it will be clear to understand this,

80
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.250
right?

81
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.200
So print I will do one thing.

82
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.460
The entered password is right.

83
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.910
I'm going to print that so that I can get clarity varieties reading password or not.

84
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.240
Right.

85
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.750
Let me run this So I'm going to run it.

86
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.250
What happened?

87
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.060
Okay.

88
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.600
I started with single quotation.

89
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.900
Sorry.

90
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.150
Double condition on any with testing liquidation in your print statement.

91
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.880
So now it's good.

92
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.500
No,

93
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.980
I'm running.

94
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.970
See the airport first of what it is asking Password.

95
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.670
Grace.

96
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.820
It's a very to see if cold as well,

97
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.050
right?

98
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.440
Read past our people.

99
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.560
This is your court.

100
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.300
What you're doing very first,

101
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.590
your important get past.

102
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.520
Why I'm imposing importing this get past model Because I'm using that in my court.

103
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.060
That's why before using always here to import.

104
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.380
Yes,

105
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.850
I did.

106
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.720
No.

107
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.700
This is like your input.

108
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.150
Syntax only you have input,

109
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.400
right?

110
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.530
Same way Get past that.

111
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.850
Get passed with parentheses.

112
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.250
This is a function.

113
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.340
Oh,

114
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.740
because off this right,

115
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.870
What you're going to get is you're going to get some problem.

116
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.900
That is password.

117
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.390
No,

118
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.500
I'm wondering BB some password.

119
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.490
See,

120
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.910
that isn't No.

121
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.700
Let me rely on.

122
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.620
And I'm going to provide.

123
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.070
Suppose Let's say fight on as password.

124
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.390
Not so.

125
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.280
Why giving your password to your skip?

126
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.330
You're not displaying that you're not echoing on your terminal.

127
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.740
That is actually good practice,

128
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.450
but never if you're probably password night.

129
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.350
Fine.

130
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.150
No.

131
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.270
Seemed biting for you.

132
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.150
Our get past giving prompt us password.

133
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.270
But instead of password.

134
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.330
If you want to provide any other from yes,

135
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.390
you can probably I see for that.

136
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.550
Want you hardly is nothing is there simply right?

137
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.260
Prom?

138
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.070
Because to entity wouldn t be password.

139
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.450
That's it.

140
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.450
Now let me say we turned on it and see the old would know what you're going to get.

141
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.440
Enter your Debus by default past,

142
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.090
get passes giving prompt us password.

143
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.290
But if you want to change your prom,

144
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.650
you can change it in this way.

145
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.850
That's a I saw the way to read your password in your real time,

146
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.020
Right?

147
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.390
See,

148
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.610
guys,

149
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.810
whatever the core you are having here,

150
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.090
same core.

151
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.580
You can run on your index elect systems as well.

152
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.650
Let me copy it.

153
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.150
I'm going to open my land X box.

154
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.270
So this is Lennox,

155
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.690
right?

156
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.450
Sorry,

157
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.600
Lennox.

158
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.340
Know what I'm doing is read.

159
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.360
Twas would not be way Copy and paste it.

160
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.360
Save it.

161
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.620
Run days.

162
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.950
So on my UNIX How given my piped on three as pipe on three.

163
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:34.190
Not like those right then it's was working like but you know the next like systems.

164
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.480
You know you have a ship dangling concert You can are your python part our very first line

165
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.580
in the script In this way,

166
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.210
that is safe.

167
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.780
Ah,

168
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.370
hash excellently.

169
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.580
Then you're part off fight on then pro.

170
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.150
Where the exclusion Permission for your script.

171
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.570
Then you can run now You're skipping this way.

172
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.250
Ended up providing bite on space to a script name?

173
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.470
Not so right.

174
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.150
Fine.

175
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.900
So days that is about ah get passed from your get past model.

176
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.750
But you're also having get user.

177
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.970
So this is also your function.

178
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.850
The purpose of this function is it displays the log in name of the user.

179
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.000
This function checks the environment Variables like log name,

180
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.750
user name and user name in order in order.

181
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.750
Right.

182
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.960
So first it will go on check aboard Log name.

183
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.060
Is there any value set for log name variable in your operating system?

184
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.950
Then it will fetch that as a user name.

185
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.520
Then it will go In case if it is not there love name variable is not there or if it is

186
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.410
empty then you're fighting Will go on check User variable Likewise,

187
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:48.590
It will check all those things see on finally returns the value off the first non empty

188
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.050
string.

189
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:54.860
So you how year Multiple variables from your operating system These all all your operating

190
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.850
system variables.

191
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.980
So why using this function?

192
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.550
Fight on what it will do means fighting will go and check this value.

193
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:08.370
If this values said that while lived well written if it is not that or if it is indeed then

194
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.950
by then we'll go and check user variable like ways.

195
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.880
Right?

196
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.650
See that?

197
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:21.360
Let me weapon my treadmill here So this biting for it if you observe that is a who suppose

198
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:30.460
in UNIX like systems you had command called Who am I study Cool I'm I easy to user So I log

199
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.850
with this system with the user to user right?

200
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:38.200
Not true Bite on Also you can get it Let me they really show you from your fight on thermal

201
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:56.050
So import get bus Let me print or let yeah get us Don't get user that they said output like

202
00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.330
so I'm not sure whether you know this Come in on your windows are not if you don t and we

203
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:14.180
command somewhere you How that mean Grip it Grip Easy to iPhone user C l log name is there

204
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.550
right?

205
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.730
Our user variable is there,

206
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:17.970
right?

207
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.370
So what?

208
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.510
You're part and we'll do means whenever If you are running your command get positive get

209
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.590
user from your fight on your part.

210
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.190
And we come to on interact with your operating system where it was like user,

211
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:35.700
right log name and whatever the value house set for this by your operating system that

212
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.200
value your fight on will display.

213
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.150
Right?

214
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:45.560
So they simply the advantage off your get to use a reason nothing but automatically you

215
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.950
confined or the logging user for your operating system.

216
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.290
That's it.

217
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.650
Okay,

218
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.240
so in General,

219
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.940
Gaudio's are actually get past is very,

220
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.560
very important.

221
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.550
Because just to read your password without equating while typing on your command like,

222
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.320
Okay,

223
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.630
guys,

224
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.950
thank you for watching this with you.
