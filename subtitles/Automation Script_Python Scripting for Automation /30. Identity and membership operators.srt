1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
prince as off?

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,290
No,

3
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,070
we computer three types off operators,

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,600
right?

5
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,950
They are ultimately assignment and comparison Operators know we're going to discuss two

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,940
more operators.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,950
There are identity and membership operators.

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,250
See why we're using how we can use them in order time,

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,430
right?

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,050
Just let me go with our identity operators.

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,430
See,

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,550
I gently Operators are usedto find the type off your object.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,750
It may be class.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,250
What is the type off your object?

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,240
It may be class or type.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,390
Maybe object.

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,160
I mean for time being,

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,890
let me do.

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,600
You are a simple example.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,190
Ah,

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,150
I'm going to open my time now.

22
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:54,880
Okay,

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,280
fine.

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,900
Just up there.

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,650
Here we have some X value.

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,750
Or let me define some new value for X And why it goes to some high.

27
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,850
Then what is the type off your ex in desire?

28
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,160
Then what is the paper?

29
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,780
Off your way.

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,890
So this is type Type off your variable.

31
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,170
Suppose x and y No,

32
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,460
let's say I'm going to defend one more variable called Why?

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,950
Why close to seven then what is the pipe off?

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:34,680
You were white in desire Gezi Free check exit closed toe No false but X and white type is

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:34,990
him.

36
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,150
What is that Pipe in Poesia type.

37
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,650
Now I want to verify.

38
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,560
Suppose for two variables whether the type is similar or not.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,790
I mean,

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:55,700
let's say is type off X is a type of way that means,

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,460
Are they equal?

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,040
Yes,

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,450
true.

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,950
But if I take type off X East type off,

45
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,860
let me define verticals.

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,550
Some string?

47
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,820
No.

48
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,140
You know what type of dessert is strings or exes in Teacher on Gary String.

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,880
Now what I'm doing is I'm going to compile type.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,610
Affects is that I pose a no Taipa fix is not the type of said yes,

51
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,420
they're not equal.

52
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,700
We know that because we know what the value is stored in X and y.

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,000
That's why type of fixes in T shirt and type of very string.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,990
But we are saying that yes,

55
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,650
they are not.

56
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,450
They're not equal in type plays.

57
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,350
Yes,

58
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,230
So in identity operators,

59
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,220
we hope to types off our producers.

60
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,770
Their season is not so.

61
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:51,200
There's simply remember that identity operators are used to find the type off your variable

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,550
suppose or type off your variable right on the one object.

63
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,160
Sometimes you know,

64
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,090
you're goingto get your type.

65
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,850
Maybe class or some object.

66
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,480
So for timing,

67
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,310
we know if you find the type of some variable you're going to get other in digital,

68
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,850
float or complex or string or bite,

69
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,050
right?

70
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,240
Well,

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,740
going forward,

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,330
we will see whenever if you get some different types there again,

73
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,950
we can use this identity operators.

74
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,650
Right.

75
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,130
Fine.

76
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,690
Then next one is membership operators.

77
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,220
See,

78
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,770
my machine.

79
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,950
Barbara does are used to evaluate the membership off a value.

80
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,680
Anyway,

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,470
by saying this,

82
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,150
you don't get much information,

83
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,550
but I want to do one thing.

84
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,600
Fasting.

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,820
Very simple information.

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,530
Days after this,

87
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:54,370
I have a list off value school 4567 Right exit started.

88
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,870
16 X Yes,

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,850
19 X No,

90
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,850
right.

91
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,050
Let us assume that in your real time you're doing some script.

92
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,930
The purpose off your script.

93
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,350
Ease right.

94
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,400
First of all,

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,030
you have some valid Let let's assume rallied,

96
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,280
Joe Abortions.

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,570
Let's say $1.6 and wondered seven our let me take.

98
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,650
We're not mine as well.

99
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,850
We're not eight under.

100
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,940
Then born lord night.

101
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,140
Just assume that these only your value job abortions.

102
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,150
You should have only these job abortions on your environment.

103
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:41,160
What up in something wrong North.

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,390
Sixth year I am miss Really a petition.

105
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,580
Fine.

106
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,880
Give us to before writing your python script,

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,450
Right?

108
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,290
First of all,

109
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,450
I'm assuming that one or 607 108 and wondered nine or value job abortions,

110
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,970
right?

111
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,870
These other valid abortions.

112
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,950
But on my host,

113
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,970
what is a job?

114
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,510
But you know how?

115
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,020
I don't know.

116
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,760
But troop Eitan skip just as unit Because as have no you cannot write your script to find a

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,790
job question from your local host.

118
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,710
Just a solution.

119
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,850
So horse to Java.

120
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,350
I am finding like this something like that.

121
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,330
But I'm not going right.

122
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,880
I'm writing some logic through that I got washing.

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,750
Has one not fight?

124
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,140
No.

125
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,750
What I always if you're horse to java,

126
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:34,540
if it is there in your value that I can say coast consist off village of Washington so join

127
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,720
Well,

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,290
Java,

129
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,500
no false.

130
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,550
Now I can say that.

131
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,590
No,

132
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,550
I can say that right?

133
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,160
Your host does not consist off value.

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,600
Job awash in liberate simple script.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,340
For this nothing is the rest.

136
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,910
Membership.

137
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,110
Something is there in a given group off values or Martin?

138
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,450
That's it.

139
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,030
Very,

140
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,980
very useful in your real time situation is same.

141
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,710
I mean scenario.

142
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,060
Very confused.

143
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,650
You are membership operators,

144
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,590
That's,

145
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:08,770
you know,

146
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,450
used him.

147
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,690
Let me copy.

148
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,020
These are the valid jar Washington by with some logic,

149
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,960
as if no directly.

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,660
I'm writing.

151
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,650
You are host job.

152
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,580
But what I will ease in your real time.

153
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,330
I will write some Lawzi to get the host job.

154
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,650
Whatever the washing is there,

155
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,550
know what I'm doing is if,

156
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:36,630
as of now I don't know what about you are Ah if statement just after that If close to Java

157
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,160
in violent Java,

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,490
then I can say print host consist off value Java,

159
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:54,170
Washington ehlz supposed to consist of what hosted deployed of the danger of contests.

160
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:07,050
You can use Mostow deployed within my lead Joe awash in So our gender.

161
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,750
This is one script.

162
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,810
Okay on.

163
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,120
I'm going to run this script.

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,860
Just see the output.

165
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,060
What?

166
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,380
You're getting close to deploy it within Balaj awash in now let us assume that you're going

167
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,160
to run this camp on another server There you have wondered seven No,

168
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,960
If you observe what is the courtyard?

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,240
Getting close to deploy with the vantage are washing.

170
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,660
That means some particular value.

171
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,200
Whether it is,

172
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,240
they're not given list off values or Mark right for that,

173
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,850
they're going to use membership operative.

174
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,330
Not only that,

175
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:37,560
Yes.

176
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Assumption.

177
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,350
One more thing because these membership operates are very,

178
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,970
very important.

179
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm going to give one more example.

180
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,350
That is,

181
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,750
there are some DB groups.

182
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,780
Are there some pre defined DB users are add menus or something like that?

183
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,460
Okay,

184
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,270
just a junction.

185
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,450
So some baby aren't menus up,

186
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,240
then go to the gym.

187
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,670
Dirt,

188
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,250
maybe.

189
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,570
Configuration user,

190
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:15,610
maybe.

191
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,230
Insulation user.

192
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,000
Something like that.

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,150
Okay.

194
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,550
Know how some user with the end user,

195
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,870
I need to start my application.

196
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,900
Just agenda.

197
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,160
I mean,

198
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,190
I need to start my db.

199
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,670
Just assume that the users which are there in this let me take this has debuts is that this

200
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,650
is the users which are there in this,

201
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,330
they only can start your baby application.

202
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,390
Just assume that right?

203
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,230
So,

204
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,120
in my hand,

205
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,110
I have some user random use.

206
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,150
I don't know whether that user is a valued debuts are not just I got some random user.

207
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,290
Let's say baby admin.

208
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,930
See if this user is there in a given group DB users,

209
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,680
then I can alone toe.

210
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,150
I mean,

211
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,270
you can Hello that user to start your DB application.

212
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,900
That's why what I'm doing is right.

213
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,850
If you are db or letting let's say random user right.

214
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,810
If random user in in DB users,

215
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,810
then I can say bring Yes,

216
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:26,290
this user is allowed to start baby,

217
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,660
that's it else.

218
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,900
Sprint This is this user.

219
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:45,690
He is not a valid user or uprising is not a valued user.

220
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,850
So stark Devi,

221
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,150
Right?

222
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,160
First,

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,730
let me run this quarter of the airport before that I'm going to come into your previous

224
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,180
school so this we will write a script toe,

225
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,520
find out even these db users valid abuses on your partner host Like so everything you can

226
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,030
write a scrip for initially,

227
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,360
right?

228
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,910
I cannot go on right Some complicated skipper and I don't want to contribute that I am

229
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,550
taking simply directly the output.

230
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,350
Okay After the output first if db Edwin Yes,

231
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,080
This user is allowed to start No,

232
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,350
let us assume that there is some users don't know some x rays and user before going to

233
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,790
start your db by the texture you that user what I will lose if that random user in my value

234
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,650
TV uses list,

235
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,750
then only how to otherwise I hard to say.

236
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,850
See that put this Caesar is not a valid user to start db so simply what you're doing.

237
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,900
You are checking something is their neck given list or not to take that we're using

238
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,150
membership operators,

239
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,080
right?

240
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,550
So whatever the thing you have,

241
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,790
all right,

242
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,190
if that thing is in the list off values,

243
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,010
you will get output as it true whenever.

244
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,280
If you're going toe combat.

245
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,810
And so I don't know what if we're going to use your membership operators false anyhow,

246
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,550
one more thing.

247
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:15,250
Not in whether given values,

248
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,150
not there.

249
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,710
Any list?

250
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,100
Yes,

251
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,250
Not in proof.

252
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,050
All right,

253
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,970
So you have two types off for membership operators,

254
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,710
and they are in and not in.

255
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,440
This may be a little bit confusion,

256
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,440
but while writing a script with your if condition while going forward,

257
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,710
you will get a clear clarity on this identity operators and membership operators for timing

258
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,710
.

259
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,970
Just a gym that some value you have to compare you are to check whether it is there in the

260
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,500
given list,

261
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,050
off values off mark to check that we're using membership operators.

262
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,050
That's it.

263
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,150
Okay,
