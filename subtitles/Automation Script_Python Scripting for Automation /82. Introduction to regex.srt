1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
friends here.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,620
We're going to discuss abode.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,060
Fight on regular expressions.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,550
Concept simply introduction part.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,950
Let me start that.

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,450
So,

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,170
first of all,

8
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,750
what is the regular expression or leg X?

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,400
See here I get to the shortcut for your regular expression.

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,790
Now,

11
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,250
the records is a procedure in any language to look for a specified pattern in a given text

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,250
.

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,700
No,

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,900
to understand that this line effectively,

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,350
you have to know what is apartment first.

16
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,150
So what is the pattern?

17
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,150
Patron is a sequence off characters which represent multiple strings.

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,850
See if they're here,

19
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,390
but only the sequence off characters.

20
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,020
But string is also your seconds off characters,

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,250
right?

22
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,610
But string is going to represent only one string.

23
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,550
But pattern is going to represent multiple strings.

24
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,240
Let me.

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,350
You are some examples for this.

26
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,650
Suppose if I take a string call in this way.

27
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,350
So,

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,790
first of all,

29
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,430
this is a string,

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:02,750
right?

31
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,730
If we use this string in your regular expressions,

32
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,950
then it is going to represent two words is And it let me take one more thing.

33
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,630
Python to three.

34
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,120
So,

35
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,690
first of all,

36
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,800
if you observe how returned this thing inside of quotations,

37
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,080
that's why this is your string first?

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,450
Awful.

39
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,150
No.

40
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,600
If I used this inside off your regular expressions than it is going to represent two words

41
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,550
So he had tours.

42
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,140
But while going forward,

43
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,600
we will see our different scenarios where you're going,

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,140
toe your pattern is going to represent multiple words.

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,250
Multiple strings.

46
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,570
Right now the gets is a procedure.

47
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,390
Any language to look for A specified pattern means to look for a number off strings in a

48
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,550
given text space.

49
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,190
Very pattern pattern is nothing but a number off for strings.

50
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,720
Right now,

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,550
Magnetics persons are useful to work with the multiple strings on a given text.

52
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,750
Let me do one of the simple example.

53
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,250
Suppose let me weapon my fight on common land First let me under in the python.

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,360
See,

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,650
I have a string like this.

56
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:22,950
Suppose my string equals two by phone Ease Simple.

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm It is easy just right.

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,350
Let me assume this has my string.

59
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,750
Okay,

60
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,460
so don't worry Aboard the you are a grammar for this in tax.

61
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,550
For this is a statement of what this string just we help some string.

62
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,840
No,

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,990
I suppose if you want to split,

64
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,810
he was string based on years.

65
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,200
Yes,

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,050
I can split by using my basic string operations.

67
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,910
Like suppose if I want to split this Yes,

68
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,050
I can split it based on it also.

69
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,120
But now my requirement is I want to split my given string wherever ease on it,

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,850
are there Did I need a split?

71
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,330
I mean here also I want to get my split with your normal string operations.

72
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,050
You cannot do it.

73
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,920
But if you go with the regular expressions So if you want to use regular expressions in

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,130
your python you have to take our remodel now simply under that already.

75
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,950
Dots plate.

76
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,150
He's on it.

77
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,780
So you had to write.

78
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,100
You had to learn these rules.

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,170
Don't worry as off.

80
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,500
No.

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,760
Just after this Where you going?

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,140
Forward.

83
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,950
We will learn how to make a pattern based on our requirement.

84
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,750
Then you will string no seed output.

85
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:49,480
You can able to split your string based on ease and it wherever easily leader there their

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,450
speed happen.

87
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,740
But with your non Muslim your business,

88
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,230
you can't You can't do it in this way.

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,990
You can split based on only one string,

90
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,290
right?

91
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,600
So this is that one days with your regular expressions.

92
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,510
Not only that,

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,880
we have so many advantages with your regular expressions.

94
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,270
So we're going forward.

95
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:12,150
We will see different situations where we hope to use regular expressions in your real time

96
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,150
.

97
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,100
But we'll go with Sylvester,

98
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,760
like,

99
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,350
fine.

100
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,650
See your regular expressions we hope are different operations.

101
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,430
So suppose here.

102
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,770
I'm going to show you some off them,

103
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,130
like match.

104
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,940
Such find.

105
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,470
All fine.

106
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,780
Deter substitute,

107
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,360
split,

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,020
Compile.

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,950
And we have some other operations as well.

110
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,720
So we are going to tickles.

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,540
Discuss all the operations off.

112
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,090
Your regular expressions are simply our remodel,

113
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,050
Mr Bester like.

114
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,860
Okay,

115
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,080
guys,

116
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,350
thank you for watching this with you.
