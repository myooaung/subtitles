ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
friends here.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.460
We're going to discuss a vote.

3
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.320
What are the rules To create a pattern such that you can use that pattern in your regular

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.050
expressions.

5
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.990
See,

6
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.350
already we know simply What is The geeks are little expression.

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.400
See,

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.000
the Ricketts is a procedure in any language to look for a specified a pattern in a given

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.450
text.

10
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.230
No,

11
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.690
If you want to work with the clerics presents using your python then you have to use a

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.630
module called rt and there is a default model.

13
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110
So if you want to work without he in your skips,

14
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.180
you hardly import that.

15
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.350
Simply import rt.

16
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.560
Now in this audio model,

17
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.810
your having different types off operations.

18
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.450
Now I'm going to show you some off them.

19
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.880
Like such match find either find all substitutes split,

20
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.960
Compile like on See as off.

21
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.260
No,

22
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.260
we are very beginning stage to work with your regular expressions.

23
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.370
That's why I'm going to show you simple sin taxes for your such much find leader and find

24
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.850
all See,

25
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.450
this is wonderful expression and here we are using such operation.

26
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.450
Now the purpose off search operation from your regular expression is different.

27
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.220
Same way the matches different find either is different.

28
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.250
Find all is different.

29
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.800
But whatever it may be,

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.750
all these operations are going to use the call pattern.

31
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.650
No,

32
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.440
before going to walk with your regular expressions operations foster fall.

33
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.130
We should be good with the pattern.

34
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.730
I mean,

35
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.660
how to create a pattern or what are the rules to create your pattern right Once.

36
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.890
If you're good with pattern,

37
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.200
then you can very easily use your required oppression from your regrets or remodel

38
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.230
something first.

39
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.640
I'm showing you a very simple examples for your pattern.

40
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.380
Are not really.

41
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.960
We know that gays.

42
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.070
What is the pattern pattern is simply a sequence off characters which represent multiple

43
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.650
strings.

44
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.750
No,

45
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.950
see that I'm taking one off the pattern called python inside off a quotation.

46
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.990
First of all,

47
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.550
this is the string your pattern,

48
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.560
but this is normally a string.

49
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.400
But when nobody for you that this is string inside off your regular expressions,

50
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.950
then it is going to become a pattern.

51
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.080
No,

52
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.500
Generally,

53
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.910
I'm saying that pattern is going to represent multiple strings,

54
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.140
but of course,

55
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.450
sometimes you were.

56
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.150
Pattern is also going to represent only one string.

57
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.250
No problem.

58
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.590
But if you use your string inside off regular expressions,

59
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.290
then this is going to become a pattern.

60
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.880
Now this pattern is going to rubble and only one string.

61
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.650
But if I take this pattern python in square Backers two and three,

62
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.540
first of all this year string normally disease string.

63
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.620
But if you use this string inside off your regular expressions now it is going to become a

64
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.120
pattern.

65
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.500
Now,

66
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.460
if it is a part time,

67
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.220
it is going to represent two strings python to and fight on three.

68
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.970
That's it.

69
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.460
Now here we hope to know how the square brackets are going to work here based on square

70
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.860
baggers.

71
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.030
No,

72
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.450
this interesting is going to represent two strings.

73
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.050
That's why this is called a pattern.

74
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.800
Now we hope to learn this type off rules to create a pattern.

75
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.640
Anyway,

76
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.030
we'll see them one by one,

77
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.420
step by.

78
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.800
Step on,

79
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.060
guys,

80
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.920
sometimes for your pattern.

81
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.150
You can also use our that is called drawstring.

82
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.240
But there is a some purpose for that.

83
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.980
We'll discuss that in your at once.

84
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.250
Level off your of your expressions.

85
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.210
No,

86
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.600
this is just to get the idea on how to create a pattern or to understanding the rules to

87
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.680
create your pattern.

88
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.440
I'm going to take one off the operation from your regular expressions that is called final

89
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.440
.

90
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.250
Because come back to all this final is very easy.

91
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.020
So I'm going to take this operation just to do The clarity on are to create rules for your

92
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.650
patterns.

93
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.050
The letter will work with all operations.

94
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.090
See once.

95
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.070
If you're good with pattern,

96
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.670
then we can work with any operation from your regular expressions I find No.

97
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.450
See that find all this is one of the operation from your regular expression.

98
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.040
Know how to use that find all simply you hardly import your ari model inside off your

99
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.650
scripts on our on your commonly then,

100
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.300
Audie don't find all patron text.

101
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.370
So this is your given text in this text you're going to such for something such for some

102
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.110
string that we're going to use Ah,

103
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.710
that that we're going to find by using final operation from your eye.

104
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.700
So finally,

105
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.450
whatever you're going to get that I'm printing,

106
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.850
that's it,

107
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.310
right?

108
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.930
See that?

109
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.400
Just to give simple idea?

110
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.560
I'm going to write a simple by transcript.

111
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.900
Let me sail this.

112
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.270
Of course,

113
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.800
you can practice this in your on your common land as well.

114
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.720
So practice for right GEC's dot The way the foster fall we're going toe work with regular

115
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.210
expressions in your python.

116
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.070
So when it we import are you and make sure that this is a default model you need to install

117
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.630
your already mortal body for it.

118
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.750
Is there with your python?

119
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.950
No,

120
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.190
First of all,

121
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.240
let me take my string or let me say simply text.

122
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.180
You can take anything.

123
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.150
This is just a variable.

124
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.250
So this is a by phone.

125
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.950
I It is easy to learn that this is my string.

126
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.620
No,

127
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.050
My intention is I won't do such a string called is in a given text.

128
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.560
See that what I'm doing is simply I'm going to create my pattern.

129
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.960
Part of it is nothing but what is your required?

130
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.450
A string?

131
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.450
What is the required string?

132
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.950
You want to search any given text?

133
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.100
That is a pattern.

134
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.620
So I want to.

135
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.610
Such with only is no.

136
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.550
Let me simply bring or you don't find all your pattern immigrant next.

137
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.470
So,

138
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.770
guys,

139
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.680
these other variables directly If you want to write you are pattern here in your detective

140
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.650
Eric invited I will show you that as well?

141
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.350
No.

142
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.090
Let me understand.

143
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.650
Seat output.

144
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.600
See in your entire text in how many places eases their see guys,

145
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.400
Be clear.

146
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.370
We are not going toe walk with world water means before you were starting a letter off

147
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.940
award each other some space after an Englander off.

148
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.100
Your worries are some spirit.

149
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.910
Then that is a word.

150
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.930
But as off No,

151
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.750
you're not going to work with the word We are going to work with your string.

152
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.070
See,

153
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.450
easy is there with the combination off this world.

154
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.550
But we are looking just simply is a string.

155
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.630
So here is is that year is there here?

156
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.970
Is that so?

157
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.810
All those is you are getting.

158
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.750
See?

159
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.910
What I'm saying is yeah.

160
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.070
Ah,

161
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.710
While working with your regular expressions directly,

162
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.450
you can write your pattern year on your next year.

163
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.110
See,

164
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.250
I'm going to write this thing,

165
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.240
but engine off writing Just I store in some variables are now.

166
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.390
I am working with variables.

167
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.480
There is no change like any.

168
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.760
But this is not a good practice.

169
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.490
Faster store you're texting.

170
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.510
Toe some variable on your pattern into some variable.

171
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.110
Then you that variables plane.

172
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.490
No.

173
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.100
How it is going to work Very simple.

174
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.950
What is your pattern is so two lectures a string you're searching.

175
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:28.390
What your python will do from your given text will take 1st 2 characters then is this.

176
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.780
But are these two characters are equals to these two characters?

177
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.150
No,

178
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.150
that's why it will skip that part.

179
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:42.600
Then we'll take second Catic good on third character H I R D equals trees.

180
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.150
No,

181
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.510
there is going to skip Then third and 40 will take Yes easily is now he's going to match.

182
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.820
You're going to get so likewise It is going to come firing your entire text wherever there

183
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.720
is a match for is those who strings.

184
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.710
You're going to get big hear Not a word.

185
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:06.400
Just simply are going to match for your string Even what is also a string See here is were

186
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.890
But here is is not a word That is the combination Off with some other word.

187
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.300
But we are not looking for a world.

188
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.620
We're looking for a string.

189
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.850
That's it.

190
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.430
No.

191
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.000
Can you tell me Very simple logic.

192
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.450
Here are these How many times is there in a given text?

193
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.050
How many times is is there any given text,

194
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:32.500
see if he observed the Operation Desert find All operation result is a listener.

195
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:38.890
We know the length we can find for a list by using lent operations so that we can conclude

196
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.350
that there are three E's strings or they're given texts.

197
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.480
It's very,

198
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.080
very important.

199
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.320
One.

200
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:52.100
That's why so First,

201
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.090
let me write once again,

202
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.950
print or you don't find all your pattern given text.

203
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.150
Fine.

204
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.950
No,

205
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.690
my intention is actually the basic purpose off your regular expression is at that time.

206
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.000
If you want to such multiple strings,

207
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.250
then we're willing to work with regular expressions.

208
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.020
No,

209
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:22.650
I want to print from my given picks wherever easy is that I mean either string on industry

210
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:22.650
,

211
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:28.400
All those things I want to print see my intention.

212
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.950
Be clear.

213
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:35.950
I want to such for he's on it in a given next.

214
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.520
So if he's is that it has to print,

215
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.000
if it is,

216
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.970
there has to print Suppose if he's is there multiple times.

217
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.450
All entries are stupid.

218
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.450
If it is there multiple times all it's it has to print.

219
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.910
But no,

220
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:54.130
you have to understand that this year your having two strings,

221
00:09:54.130 --> 00:10:01.290
but from these you need to make a pattern such that that pattern has to represent these two

222
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.840
strings.

223
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.650
So there,

224
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.330
by using that pattern,

225
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.910
you can search any given string for these two strings.

226
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.880
So if you have your first character is common,

227
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.080
No,

228
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.640
that's why I can take simply I then second character.

229
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.070
It may be,

230
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.340
yes,

231
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.950
rt.

232
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.010
So whenever there is a possibility off this one or that one,

233
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.550
then just simply right square brackets inside of that just right.

234
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.920
Yes.

235
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:31.950
T rt a snowball on both are same right now I see that what I'm doing is injured off ease.

236
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.550
Foster characterizes.

237
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.990
Sorry,

238
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.650
I but second character,

239
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.210
maybe yes or maybe d No.

240
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.390
See,

241
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.100
there is a is is it is yes,

242
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.580
you are getting but you need to follow other here.

243
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.190
I mean first.

244
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.390
Yes,

245
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:46.840
the second.

246
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.280
No,

247
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.820
not like that.

248
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.450
You can also write p assaults or no bottom.

249
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:56.430
See that Now you are looking for a string which contest off two characters.

250
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.250
First of all,

251
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.630
aren't that string to Carter string maybes?

252
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:08.420
Or maybe it Now you are going to search for two strings little went off to.

253
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.450
That means two characters in each string.

254
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.450
Those since are eaten is in a given text.

255
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.110
Now,

256
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.750
if there are any given text then you're finally is going to find them.

257
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.360
Let's say somewhat,

258
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.780
I'm trying to find Let me come in.

259
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.950
This I want to find like my bargaining goes to simply X.

260
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.940
Do you have X and you are given text?

261
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.370
No,

262
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.350
that's why are getting empty,

263
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.750
right?

264
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.550
Do you know yet?

265
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.890
Yes.

266
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.030
How many times he is there?

267
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.500
That many number of times you are getting here.

268
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.910
Is that be clear?

269
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.370
Very,

270
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.270
very important Here.

271
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.510
Is there here?

272
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.020
Is there yet?

273
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.650
Is there so wherever you help Yea,

274
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.550
that all is You're getting here.

275
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:59.780
So if you go without once the operations like such find all the refined in there,

276
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.840
then you're going to get the in expression as well.

277
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.470
What is off?

278
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.580
Index off first?

279
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.330
Matching character.

280
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.050
Much first of matching string on second matching string.

281
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.150
We will see that in and once 11.

282
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.380
So for timing,

283
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.200
we have to understand how to create a pattern.

284
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.750
No,

285
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:22.250
Here I'm going to show you the simple rules to create your pattern.

286
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:27.130
But these just first level roots basic rules.

287
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.290
So we will see at once.

288
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:35.280
Level rules in next video find The very first thing is suppose I want to match.

289
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.170
You haven t been directly hard right here.

290
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.320
There is no any other option.

291
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.010
I mean,

292
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.600
suppose here our 10 year right?

293
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.940
So you are going to match everything it then you are getting No.

294
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.850
But I want to match with some number.

295
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.300
If number is there 9 to 9.

296
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.560
If that nine number is there any given string done given sting me specs.

297
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.750
Today's in this text variable If you have a nine,

298
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.850
then this spite on will find that.

299
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.060
But as off No,

300
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.040
you don't have any nine number in a given text.

301
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.910
That's why it is not finding so simple.

302
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.790
Rule is if you want to match with any particular character with the popular character

303
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.510
character,

304
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.470
the needle solidarity,

305
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.780
right?

306
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.660
Your partners that character only Let's say somewhere I'm having a great no,

307
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.810
I want to such home.

308
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.150
Your times are ready.

309
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.350
Is there any given text?

310
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.080
See that one time?

311
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.150
Let me read somewhere Once again This did it.

312
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.240
No.

313
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.460
Let me read on your corn and see the results in two places.

314
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.160
You our today?

315
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.450
No.

316
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.450
Those two are drinks you are getting fine.

317
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.570
No.

318
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.250
If you want to match any character with Butler character,

319
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.850
then you're to write that careful itself.

320
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.600
That is anywhere.

321
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.200
We know that.

322
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.670
Generally second see,

323
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:56.950
just know we have seen that if I write something like ts r S t what is the meaning for this

324
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:56.950
?

325
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:02.150
It is going to look for ever tea or for us,

326
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:10.070
but its aim If Eric ABC if I don't ABC how it is going to look for a diary a or b R c in a

327
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.850
given text.

328
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:16.970
Let me show you that so that you can understand Suppose I am reading as I know my pattern

329
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.490
is a drink.

330
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:23.830
Now you're finally is going to match are looking a given text only 400 know What I'm doing

331
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.050
is if I write something like our did eight year,

332
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.550
what is the meaning for this?

333
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:34.880
You are going to look for a string which consist off at the rate on the immediately side by

334
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.190
side,

335
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.980
at the rate and year.

336
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.610
Do you have any where any given text?

337
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.980
No,

338
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.210
no.

339
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.950
Where we Howard the rate only immediately in a given text.

340
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.680
Now see,

341
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:49.350
that is are empty but I want to look either for a day or four year or for yes,

342
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:56.050
you can have any number off characters inside off square records know the meaning is agenda

343
00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:01.850
your by Tony's going to such for today also for year and also for us.

344
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.400
No,

345
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:02.550
see,

346
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.970
there isn't.

347
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.570
How many times s are there that many times you're going to get this hominid?

348
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.020
EMC is there that many times here you're getting home in times already,

349
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.060
is there you're getting now,

350
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.830
First of all,

351
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.530
you're looking for only one character string in a given string.

352
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.220
That character maybe at the rate maybe.

353
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.170
Or maybe yes.

354
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.460
So all these three are there some number of times you're going to get all of them that many

355
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.250
number of times,

356
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.250
right?

357
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.050
Fine,

358
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.280
no.

359
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.050
See here.

360
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:39.380
So sometimes I want to just a gender.

361
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.700
I want to look for another year or B or C or d r e r a f.

362
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:52.540
So what is the meaning off if you write any characters in inside of a square bracket means

363
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.260
first of all,

364
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.250
this entire thing is one character.

365
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.280
But that character,

366
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.940
maybe,

367
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:03.990
or maybe B or maybe C d like ways so I converted in this way.

368
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:11.120
If I want to look for a three r B R C R D r your f But all these are sequence characters

369
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.630
like Where do you have?

370
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.660
So instead of writing in this way,

371
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.830
there is a shortcut for this.

372
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.980
You can also write simply year to year,

373
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.260
not a meaningful.

374
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.550
This is you're going to look for one character stream,

375
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.010
but that character,

376
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.640
maybe a or maybe be or upto.

377
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.010
Yes,

378
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:28.850
that's it.

379
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.730
No,

380
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.050
I assume that something like this I want to such a string.

381
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.190
Oh,

382
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:39.850
let's see.

383
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:44.220
Yeah B c d a.

384
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:56.930
Three r b r C R B r Some h i j k Yell our x y z No spaces,

385
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.220
guys.

386
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.400
Yes,

387
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:58.920
I Jr.

388
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.040
How does the a,

389
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.190
B,

390
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.590
C D at a J K l our next ways there?

391
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.830
No.

392
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.490
What is the first awful meaning for this?

393
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.000
If you write anything in skirt inside off the square brackets,

394
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.180
it is going to look for one character string,

395
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.550
but that character maybe year or maybe something like that from this group.

396
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.760
But if you have their first of four characters are sequence next to fight,

397
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.170
characters are also in sequence.

398
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.110
Next three carpets are also sequence.

399
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.110
In that case,

400
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:35.110
you can also add shortcut as it would be nobody for later to means a B c d,

401
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:44.630
then pitch hyphen yell The meaning for this is heads I j k l then X iPhone there know the

402
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.510
meaning for this is X wiser just for the shortcut.

403
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.110
This is right.

404
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.350
No,

405
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.460
see that.

406
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.450
Let me take a given text.

407
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.800
So my intention is let me write.

408
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.370
They let me come in these quarters off.

409
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.660
No,

410
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.890
actually,

411
00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:08.850
my invention It just I want to look for a three r b r seat or D.

412
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:09.850
Let me take it.

413
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:18.050
So my pattern I want to look for only for either yea r B or C or D,

414
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.700
but nobody If you want to look for either er BRC rd.

415
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.350
Then you had to write your characters inside off the square brackets.

416
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.290
Now let me bring Ah,

417
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.720
Your operation is from Maury.

418
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.700
Find all from your part.

419
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.050
Run.

420
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.990
You are given a text.

421
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.440
No.

422
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.390
See the result a B,

423
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.000
C D.

424
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.690
C is not there nowhere and be also not there.

425
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.170
But he Andy is there.

426
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.350
That's why you're getting that?

427
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.140
Yeah,

428
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.460
yeah,

429
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:45.860
yeah,

430
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.190
yeah,

431
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.690
right.

432
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:55.850
But the same thing I can also right here to d see the result First two years,

433
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.450
one B two years.

434
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.100
No.

435
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.080
See the result I'm going to rely on by changing my pattern,

436
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.090
Something you're getting.

437
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.970
So this is exactly equal stools A B,

438
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.580
C D.

439
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.780
Sometimes you're going to look for any character.

440
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.120
Suppose there to said no need to read the A B c D e f d a poser simply adversity can,

441
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.290
right?

442
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:16.540
Yeah,

443
00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.700
I found it in squared records.

444
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.050
That's it.

445
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:23.420
So this is one of the rules then.

446
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.850
So that's what I'm giving here.

447
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.880
So this is already we discussed.

448
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.150
Suppose if how a B,

449
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.850
C D some hedge A jacket on X rays there you can also write short cut in this way.

450
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.260
No,

451
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:42.760
let me take small w slash w matches Any single character or disease or underscore.

452
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.160
See that?

453
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.760
See you guys,

454
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.810
if I write simply,

455
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.640
partners here is going to match with toe only.

456
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.950
Yet you're finally is going to look for this year in a given text for you only.

457
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.880
But if you right into Javier for right,

458
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:05.010
some special symbol chords slash double You know the meaning for disease Any number Any all

459
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.710
forbid from you,

460
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.190
does it?

461
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:12.880
Our capital Do said then number Gerardo nine are maybe underscored.

462
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:21.900
Also see suppose if we have a textual ABC and if I write a pattern year now if I look into

463
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.200
this year is going to get only one time.

464
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:31.190
But if I write in place off yes slash W is also a slash w or B also comes under slash wc

465
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.570
also come from the slash the blue Now you're going to get three characters because last w

466
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:42.900
means any any alphabet Our number on one underscored as well Let me show you this on your

467
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.990
script See,

468
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.450
my invention is let me take no First of all,

469
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.760
let me come in the score.

470
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.850
Let's be clear.

471
00:20:53.850 --> 00:21:01.080
I'm going to take my pattern as magnetic.

472
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.610
Sorry,

473
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.460
I'm not taking frosting as off.

474
00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:04.710
No,

475
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:05.730
but we have to take it.

476
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.420
I will tell you when you had to take our fine Know what I'm doing?

477
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.240
This simply I'm reading slash w not see the result.

478
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.510
If I do bring,

479
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.760
you were already door Find all your pattern in a given text.

480
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.070
See the reserve.

481
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.810
You're going to get all matching things except the space.

482
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.620
Are we getting space matching?

483
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.070
See,

484
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:32.710
after this ease between the Cindy's.

485
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.600
We have a space.

486
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.200
Are we getting a space any very yet?

487
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.580
No.

488
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.750
Because space not comes on this last small W That's why I'm not getting the matching for

489
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.090
their on under.

490
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.740
It not comes under.

491
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.970
We were slash the blue.

492
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:46.530
That's what he is.

493
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.760
Not a match for your slash w That's why you're not getting there.

494
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.120
Let me rate somewhere high fun Unlimited somewhere underscore.

495
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.690
I'll see that is in.

496
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.790
You're getting underscore between war and yell.

497
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.000
There is a underscore,

498
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.260
but between warned understory of a space that space is not a match you're not getting there

499
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.460
on iPhone is not comes under this slash the blue,

500
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.510
but underscore comes on a slash w That's why are getting here.

501
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.010
No,

502
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:23.820
I am looking for your letter string or two character string If I read slash w slash w The

503
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.320
meaning for the days Just are you mention yea means sorry.

504
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.360
Slash w means here to jets more letters on a desert capital.

505
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.050
Letters and numbers 0 to 9 on Underscore.

506
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:41.370
Now if I rated to slash W's The meaning for that is it may be year yet Yeah,

507
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:41.850
baby.

508
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.700
Yes,

509
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.120
see,

510
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.840
like weighs a desert on B A B.

511
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.410
BBC like ways are maybe eijiro year.

512
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.080
One year,

513
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.590
two up,

514
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.450
two year nine Are you underscore?

515
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.660
Might be underscore.

516
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.680
See underscored like where you're going to get number off combinations among all those

517
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.550
combinations,

518
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.580
Whatever the matching,

519
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.720
Is there any given string?

520
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.760
You're going to get them,

521
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:13.980
See if I write slash w slash w The meaning for that is you're going to look for it's string

522
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:13.980
,

523
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.050
which consist off two characters.

524
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.280
Now,

525
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.800
if I run Days City,

526
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.410
it is also one match for this.

527
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.970
First let me on this and see the airport already can understand.

528
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.450
See that?

529
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.760
Be it to let us bring us much.

530
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.160
That's why we're getting there.

531
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.550
He's Yes,

532
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.160
you are getting,

533
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.140
then is your in between.

534
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.960
You have a space right spaces not comes under your slash W.

535
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.710
That's why you're not getting that is yes,

536
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:44.230
you are getting see yeah is only one single character before he.

537
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.970
And after you have a space so combination with year,

538
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.200
you don't know any value.

539
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.950
The character,

540
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:55.950
which comes under slash w in case of space comes on a slash w You're going to get yes,

541
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:56.850
space also,

542
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.680
but space not comes under slash w matching.

543
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.820
That's why for yea,

544
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.420
you don't have any combination toe get to character string.

545
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:14.750
That's why there is not going to match for your pattern like And one more thing.

546
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.620
See that last elite suppose?

547
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.950
Does your character string?

548
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.550
You are to character string,

549
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.470
but for you,

550
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.960
you don't know again any matching to get a two character string after the end.

551
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.990
Suppose if you have any character,

552
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.230
let's a year now.

553
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.020
If we're on this,

554
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.510
see the last thing you're getting year after we are now.

555
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.470
I already year year.

556
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.850
Let a character my for real on you're going to get in you also.

557
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.490
Not only year you can take underscore also,

558
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.810
because understood also comes on a slash W.

559
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.450
You're going to get match by using these two characters combination.

560
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:59.110
Now let me rate 33 Character matching guys know the meaning for disease.

561
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.500
You're going to look for a string which consist off three characters.

562
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.880
But what are those three characters we know?

563
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:12.860
Slash w means any character here to say smaller capital Jiro to nine on underscore only

564
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.240
from these three groups.

565
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.260
It is going to look for three character string.

566
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:17.910
No,

567
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.120
let me run this and see the result.

568
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.340
He had tight three little character.

569
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:22.530
Yes,

570
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.790
you are getting but for yes.

571
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.320
After that you have a space so space not comes under slash W.

572
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.760
That's why there is no possibility for this year's to make three letter character There is

573
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.280
going to skip then.

574
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.240
For years you have wanted to characters,

575
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.200
but you don't have any three characters a string,

576
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.370
Because if you want to get the three character string here,

577
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.260
we have a space.

578
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.920
But space is not comes in a slash W.

579
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.870
That's why you're not getting your part for this same here for you.

580
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:52.050
You don't have any three carpets thing but fight on PPV i d.

581
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.540
Three characters,

582
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.430
varied characters,

583
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.910
actually,

584
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.050
in three characters,

585
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.540
that's we're getting there.

586
00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:58.970
Yeah,

587
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.260
a nd three characters.

588
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.580
For if you don't have any valid three characters,

589
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.250
that's why you're not getting he's yes year Yes,

590
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.950
three characters,

591
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.410
but for way we don't have any ah three character string combination.

592
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.500
That's where this is not a part like waste you're getting.

593
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.450
I hope you're good with this.

594
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.520
No,

595
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.050
let me go with a capital W matches any character,

596
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:30.790
not part off slash W So whatever you have in this small w other than that all are going toe

597
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.000
comes from this capital.

598
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:46.640
W c that now let me come in this first let me take my partner small o w only,

599
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.270
and see the result of first print or you don't find all nice.

600
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.990
You can get clarity by doing practice.

601
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.110
Please do same thing once.

602
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.590
I mean,

603
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.890
whatever we done here,

604
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:02.450
same thing you just practice once and try to understand how you're going to get your output

605
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.300
more like Mitt on this sensitive output.

606
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.200
But if I make it as a capital of you sooty on the head,

607
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.440
try.

608
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.040
Yes,

609
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.110
whatever you're getting here.

610
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.320
No,

611
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.520
these are not the part off capital of you.

612
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.850
They're part of small w.

613
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:17.850
That's fine.

614
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.450
If I write capital of you,

615
00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.840
see what you're going to get,

616
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:26.280
you're going to get spaces that did it on a hyphen because these are not the part off your

617
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.450
capture small of you.

618
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:33.600
It is going to look for a character which is not there in this group.

619
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:41.600
Small w group space is their match for cattle of you are there It is the match for capital

620
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.940
w See how many spaces are there,

621
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.760
All those spaces you're going to get here?

622
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.410
So that is the use off capital.

623
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:55.200
W simply the members which are there in this other than that remaining all or comes on a

624
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.980
capital w very,

625
00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.660
very important,

626
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:03.760
then slash b matches their dismal desert Gero denying any number.

627
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.950
See anyway bitey for the small w means it also include your numbers.

628
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:14.420
But along with numbers slash the blue includes alphabet and underscore.

629
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.660
But I want to match with only numbers.

630
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.850
Let's say a house somewhere.

631
00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:30.160
Let me write Fight on three by 10 3 on Let's say somebody just for a year I'm writing Fight

632
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.600
on two on something.

633
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.500
I'm reading some number.

634
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.560
Let's say for okay,

635
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.880
I know what I'm doing is I'm going to take a pattern as some slash d.

636
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.770
You know what is meant?

637
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.660
B slash d Any number genital nine.

638
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.420
See,

639
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:55.170
I'm going to take patroness slash Lee and let me print it Audie door find all study find

640
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.660
all your part run in a given text.

641
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.340
So very What number is there because you are looking for only one number One string.

642
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:08.030
Sorry it character which consist off only one busy a string which consist off only one

643
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.430
character.

644
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.160
That Is it busy?

645
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.250
No.

646
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.570
See the result 243 Yes.

647
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.350
You have somewhere to 40 are getting there?

648
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.270
No,

649
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.450
my indention Ease.

650
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.180
Bite on with some number.

651
00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:24.740
So before slash D I should have a word called Fight on after that.

652
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.440
Any number?

653
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.350
Maybe two or three.

654
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.180
No,

655
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.220
You fire Lundy's.

656
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.550
You're going to get fight on after that number.

657
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:30.880
Is there?

658
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.100
No,

659
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.760
that now This is the match for this pattern.

660
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.350
At the same time,

661
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.350
fight on trees also match for slash D.

662
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.350
Suppose if I write only piped on two.

663
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:48.250
You're going to get only piped on 32 because directly are mentioning match to with to fight

664
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:55.830
on two with bite on Do but I want to match with python slash d means the meaning for this.

665
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.410
It is going to represent bite on Jiro.

666
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.230
Bite on one fight on to python three are to fight on mine.

667
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.980
But among all those whatever the strings are there in a given text.

668
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.990
Those things,

669
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.950
those who strings on it is going to match.

670
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:14.210
That's it right now.

671
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:23.760
Let's say in June of this pattern I want to look for a string which consist off two visits

672
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:23.760
.

673
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.990
Do you have anything in this?

674
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.080
No.

675
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.750
Just sequence,

676
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.970
Lee.

677
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.400
I mean,

678
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.470
emergent Tory's know where we're having.

679
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.550
That's why you're not getting that.

680
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.710
Let's say I want right here.

681
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.880
45 something.

682
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.970
Now you're getting that because Tories are there you're looking for slash This last day

683
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.230
means a string which consist off two visits.

684
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.810
Yes,

685
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.530
you're getting no.

686
00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:51.980
So in this basically is Let me go with the last one dot very,

687
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.780
very important one at the same time.

688
00:30:53.780 --> 00:31:01.820
Confusion one very useful in your real time dot That matches any single character except a

689
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.050
new line character.

690
00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:12.410
See if you take slash w Other than this members all our comes on this last capital W But if

691
00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.250
you go with the dog,

692
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:18.070
all valued characters which are there in your keyboard are in charge there.

693
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.620
And you are our computer language.

694
00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.550
All are going to match with your dot except the new line.

695
00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.160
See that?

696
00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.490
Let me coming.

697
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:36.980
These things first because these are very basic rules to create your patterns.

698
00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.410
We have at once levels husband.

699
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.450
We'll see them in your next video.

700
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.350
So not my intention is I'm taking a patroness.

701
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:50.110
Dark means match with any character.

702
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:57.550
Now see that What you're going to get You're part one comma text.

703
00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:05.040
All are going to get See that are going to get the each and every carpet which is there in

704
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.850
a given text.

705
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.460
Anyway,

706
00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:12.170
we don't have any slash and I'm in new lining over given X except that that is going to

707
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.580
match all things now If you have the he hedge,

708
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.510
I Yes,

709
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.750
after that space is there in a given text.

710
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.040
Yes,

711
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.880
that space is also matching for dark,

712
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.920
Dark mint dot means anything simply other than slash and no,

713
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.390
I want to match any two characters then by two dots.

714
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.520
Now see the result I want to match for three dots.

715
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.160
I mean any three characters any three symbols which are there in a computer language.

716
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.660
See that?

717
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.270
33 you're going to get no,

718
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.510
my intention Ease.

719
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:56.060
I want to match dot with dot only not generally dot means in your pattern dot means for any

720
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.050
matching except new line.

721
00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:02.080
But I want to match dot with dot Let's say in a given text somewhere.

722
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.590
How?

723
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.260
Dr.

724
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.180
Fight on to dot Now,

725
00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.640
if I run this what you're getting so you know,

726
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.050
you're also going to get somewhere dot Also,

727
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:19.450
you're looking for three visits.

728
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.020
String.

729
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.810
Yes.

730
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.330
Sorry.

731
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.520
Three character string.

732
00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:23.710
Yes,

733
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.380
you're getting young to dot But along with the daughter,

734
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.740
you are also getting some other strings.

735
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.030
No,

736
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.100
but I don't want to get them.

737
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:36.510
I want to get exactly dot with dot Only I want to match my dot with dot See if you remember

738
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:36.510
.

739
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.370
If you want to match every theater,

740
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:44.400
let's say this is your text CNBC This is your text and you want to write a pattern so you

741
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.550
can write a part on if you want to match we every year,

742
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.210
year only.

743
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.340
Or writing now in my Texas somebody How dark.

744
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:55.290
But I want to match it dark with the dot simply whether dot dot is going to match with any

745
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:55.850
character.

746
00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:00.730
But I want to match this dot With this dot only at that time you had to escape.

747
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:05.050
You are special purpose off your dog by placing slash symbol.

748
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:11.960
Let me run days slash dot Now see the result.

749
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.010
Let me write some other ways.

750
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.250
Us some in other places dark.

751
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.040
See that not to.

752
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.800
But if I remove this slash now you're going to get all characters which are going to match

753
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.880
for your daughter by simply dot means anything.

754
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.350
That's it except new line.

755
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:32.740
So it's very,

756
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.050
very important days if you want to match dot with the daughter you had to use in your

757
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.720
pattern slash dot Very,

758
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.860
very useful example.

759
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.160
I'm going to do you really time.

760
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.850
Let's say you have a text in this week.

761
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.870
This is my i p off a BB somewhat.

762
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.150
It's just I Jr Ah,

763
00:34:54.150 --> 00:35:01.680
some to 55 dot Let's say one double Jiro.

764
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.830
Ah,

765
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.060
one Jiro too.

766
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.460
Of course.

767
00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.390
Um,

768
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.570
as off.

769
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.790
No,

770
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.840
I'm taking in my A p in all places in all places.

771
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.660
Three digits.

772
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.090
But see you.

773
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:15.180
Me?

774
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.850
How sometimes you're only two digits are one visit right.

775
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.290
But as off no.

776
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.460
Based on our rules,

777
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.730
if I go with this example,

778
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.010
you can understand later,

779
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:26.710
we will see you know at once level if you have only one day city year out,

780
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.370
auto match.

781
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.250
Everything we will see.

782
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.110
No,

783
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.550
I am goingto tell you one important thing from your real time.

784
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.120
So you are going to run some script already Some information.

785
00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.350
Is there somewhere in your text file And you're going to read that?

786
00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.860
But you don't know Very ripe.

787
00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.550
Is there a June?

788
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:50.390
Are You're getting some upward Somewhere in that I'll put you how it be But you don't know

789
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:55.320
where exactly Your i p is there where exactly where I please there.

790
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.750
But I want to fetch only my i p.

791
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.900
How you can read the backer.

792
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.570
See,

793
00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.660
I can buy the bottom any variable.

794
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.340
Just take anybody I'm taking simply no pattern on my part.

795
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.540
Not part of our exit Coast Also you can take see as off.

796
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:12.900
No,

797
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.740
I'm assuming that in my a p in all places three digits number is there.

798
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.250
That's why slash these last days.

799
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:27.150
Last day means you are looking for three disease string in a given text.

800
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:34.700
But first let me Lundy's so that you can understand what happened.

801
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.090
Yeah.

802
00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.590
Sorry.

803
00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.740
I heard it at the end.

804
00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.030
One more extra slash.

805
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.810
Fine.

806
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:39.740
I'll see that.

807
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.680
Find all your pattern.

808
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.650
You were text.

809
00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.840
See the output.

810
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.210
Okay.

811
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.410
Admitted that three visits,

812
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:55.810
no seed output 2 55 1 double zero and 0 to 10 to your getting separately.

813
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.450
But this entire thing is one I p.

814
00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.220
I want to get us of only one value.

815
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.150
Not like this.

816
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.900
Then one iota dough.

817
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.340
I want to write a pattern such that it is going to match with this thing.

818
00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.630
I don't know exact number.

819
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.260
What is there?

820
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.130
But I know in each and every operation there are three digits,

821
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.070
then three slash d slash days,

822
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:24.550
then dark slash This last day slash d dot slash This lastly slash B darks large.

823
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.450
These last D slash d No,

824
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.690
si don't put it's working perfectly,

825
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.960
right?

826
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.200
It's working perfectly now.

827
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.740
CDA magic.

828
00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:44.160
Let's say here are injured off slash d.

829
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.650
What I'm doing is slash w m writing.

830
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.490
Yes,

831
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:55.660
agenda Because under slash W You're also going to get a disease,

832
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:55.950
right?

833
00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:00.180
No.

834
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.460
See the result what you're getting you are getting No,

835
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.240
I'm writing.

836
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.730
He had a a s something in this way.

837
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.510
I'm writing mostly the result.

838
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:17.040
What you're getting No,

839
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.730
very your daughter.

840
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.310
You're known.

841
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:25.280
Then why it is matching with the aura given pattern because dot means anything but I want

842
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:32.730
to match dot with the guard only I want to match dot With not only otherwise,

843
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:34.670
let me take in terms off numbers only.

844
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.580
So that a good idea?

845
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:41.460
Let's say 12 three Ah,

846
00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.970
on extra number.

847
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.330
Let me write some numbers.

848
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:50.220
Some number He's not a p right,

849
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.500
But I'm writing some number now.

850
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.330
Let me right in sharp for this thing.

851
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:59.230
Let's be clear why I am giving this means In your real time,

852
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:04.760
you're going to get sometimes confusion for that I'm giving some clarity here to use your

853
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.640
slash deep.

854
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.080
No,

855
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.370
you filing the suit output.

856
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.760
This is I p but this is not a happy right.

857
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.590
Our indigenous three digits then 30.3 reduced,

858
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.610
then dark religious,

859
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.020
then dark three digits In this way,

860
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.640
if I if I have any string in a given text that only I want to fetch Yes,

861
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.850
I'm fighting that along with that.

862
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.030
Why I'm getting this.

863
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:36.530
See now you are not matching dot with dot If you want to match this dart with the dis Adar

864
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.530
,

865
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:43.890
you don't write down your direct slash dot Simply if I write to dar dot means any visit any

866
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.520
character,

867
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.030
that's why c slash d slash d This is going to match for first of three disease.

868
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.560
Then dark means anything.

869
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:50.750
No,

870
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:51.000
no,

871
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.090
this is also going to match again.

872
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:53.820
Three digits?

873
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.110
Yes,

874
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:54.810
three digits,

875
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.050
then dot means anything phase out.

876
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.330
So I'm going to match for dark.

877
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:05.240
But our intention is not for this type off numbers some three digits then dot Something to

878
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.560
use,

879
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.130
then door,

880
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.590
then some three visitors dark like ways.

881
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.870
That's why if you want to match with dot with dark,

882
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.130
you had to use slash door.

883
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.980
That's a No.

884
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.730
Zero deserved.

885
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:24.160
So that's why there is a small difference between daughter and slash dot You need to

886
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.630
understand that clearly soon building.

887
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:31.370
I want to match dot with the daughter only then you had red slash dark.

888
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.820
That's it.

889
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.630
Okay.

890
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.360
Okay,

891
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:34.580
guys,

892
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.620
don't get confused.

893
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.160
We're going toe practice.

894
00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:37.520
Ah,

895
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.340
