00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
friends here.

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.190
We're going toe work with CS three files using Python.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.780
So first of all,

4
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.850
what is CSP?

5
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.540
So guys simply CSC is a comma Separator values that means whatever the values you have in a

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.360
CSP file,

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.630
they all are separated by a comma or separate res comma or dilemma.

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.550
Trees come separated or de limiter is seen,

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.380
right?

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.950
Fine.

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.770
No,

12
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.050
Why?

13
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.960
We're using this.

14
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.730
So you're when we use this just to store tabler type of data such as you were excellent or

15
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.180
database data off course.

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.150
We can store our data as it a tabular form in your excel shoots as well.

17
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.850
But come pacto excel sheets CS we Is there a simple way to store your tabler type of data?

18
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.530
Let me do one thing.

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.260
First of all,

20
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.750
I'm going to open a simple fight.

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.280
Let me open a file called simply any any text file.

22
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.110
I'm going to open it,

23
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.360
right.

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.950
Fine.

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.450
See that?

26
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.600
Let me open it First seem by default,

27
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.180
you will see a sweet data is separated with Come on.

28
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.850
So basically see so you can assume that CS was like your excel sheet or tabular data.

29
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.840
The tablet is nothing But you have rows and columns.

30
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.630
Your data.

31
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.040
Your data is like gross and column.

32
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.350
Let's say Ah,

33
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.750
how supposed column A serial number?

34
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450
Name,

35
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.150
couple salary,

36
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.650
then skill.

37
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.150
So I'm going to store in this way.

38
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.050
Suppose let's say,

39
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.050
John,

40
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.750
Right on.

41
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.440
Study salad.

42
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.630
Eight.

43
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050
Some $2000.

44
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.860
Let's say Piper,

45
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.820
then how,

46
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.500
Jason?

47
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.850
Then $1000.

48
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.540
Then I hope supposed bash.

49
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.850
Let me save it.

50
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.240
Does I just see us?

51
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.850
We fight some in four dot CS week.

52
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.850
That's it.

53
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.300
So I saved your file as dot CS we extension as it see us.

54
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.750
We fight.

55
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.770
See?

56
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.210
Now this is your Sears terrified.

57
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.620
I can weapon.

58
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.190
This is yes.

59
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.250
We filed with any note back,

60
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.360
right?

61
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.050
See that your data is there as it is.

62
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.070
Oh,

63
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.620
by the fourth,

64
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.650
I can ableto weapon that using your excellent shoots as well.

65
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.990
See that on for medical?

66
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.350
Your data is arranged in terms off rows and columns in terms off rows and columns.

67
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.100
So,

68
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.350
guys,

69
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.050
if you observe while storing your data right,

70
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.150
we store our data by taking comma as the separator between your columns,

71
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.500
right?

72
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.270
Not only that,

73
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.330
you can also store your data by taking any other day limit Razzle,

74
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.150
let's say I'm going today again.

75
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.630
Same data with the dilemma.

76
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.150
It was something like Pipeline serial number name,

77
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.950
supple salary.

78
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.200
Then I'm going to take skill.

79
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.150
Let's say serial number one John,

80
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.050
I'm taking salary supposed $2000 skill.

81
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.240
Let's say fighting.

82
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.520
Same way.

83
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.460
I'm going to store one more data.

84
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.550
You can take anything.

85
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.270
So here,

86
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.730
my interns knees in case you for take separate rather than comma.

87
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.970
How you can work with the What sees REFIles That's important.

88
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.850
Let me now sell this file as a some new info dot CSP.

89
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.190
Let me say,

90
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.240
with us Nazis,

91
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.370
we find Let's a name as new in full dot CS week.

92
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.850
Nothing.

93
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.450
No.

94
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.160
Previously,

95
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.730
you store your data by taking separate routes comma,

96
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.890
but now I have taken some progress pipeline by default.

97
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.950
If I weapon that I see that now you are not getting your data in terms off columns.

98
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.840
See that Your Excellency is not able to identify your data as in terms Off column that has

99
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.450
given only one column.

100
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.850
But you know the delimited right?

101
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.870
What is the deal emitter you used to create your CSU file?

102
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.450
Just set up your column.

103
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.130
Goto data X two columns Deli meat.

104
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.010
A millimeter,

105
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.480
right.

106
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.930
Just select the other un provided were biplane as See that Now you're able to fetch.

107
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.870
You are later.

108
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.360
I mean,

109
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.530
you were ableto ah,

110
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.480
convertible daytime.

111
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.750
The number off columns based on the separator you you used for your data.

112
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.450
Right?

113
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.090
So this is also one type off,

114
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.750
including,

115
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.480
See if you know,

116
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.050
pipeline then only can able to recruit the data from your fight.

117
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.910
So if 30% don't know what is that?

118
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.190
A limited you used for your data?

119
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.530
Them?

120
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.000
They can't separate your data like so It's like a one type off.

121
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.550
Including,

122
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.910
of course not.

123
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.630
Not much good,

124
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.700
but up to something limited.

125
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.650
It is good practice.

126
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.450
That's fine.

127
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.640
In case if his story what data in CS refile,

128
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.000
it is very easy to transform your data to your database or from greater base to a few 100

129
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.450
download.

130
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.750
It is very easy to donor into CS three fights.

131
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.750
That's when real time most of the cases you will work with CSP files.

132
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.550
Intern off Excel shoots.

133
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.950
That's fine.

134
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.990
No base a junior.

135
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.500
You how one sees we fight?

136
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.630
No.

137
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.710
You want to read the data using python.

138
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.950
Then how you can really right.

139
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.840
See,

140
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:12.310
let me sell a script name called Really CSP any anything you can take it now I'm going to

141
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.790
take it.

142
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.150
Ah,

143
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.450
I'm going to store some where you can store anywhere.

144
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.350
Let's say I want to store here.

145
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.050
Read CS.

146
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.680
We file,

147
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.850
not fight on.

148
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.650
So if you want to read a CSP file or if you want to write a daytime to your CSU file in

149
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.510
your python,

150
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.600
you have a default model called CSP.

151
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.180
Fortunately,

152
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.580
import that these are the for the model.

153
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.750
You can bet it to use that.

154
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.150
Then let me take required file to read.

155
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.020
So samples that finally,

156
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.380
someone,

157
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.950
let's say in four dot c a sweet they.

158
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.120
But guys,

159
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.810
whenever if you're working with files,

160
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.550
it is a good practice to provide complete part.

161
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.950
Right?

162
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.520
See,

163
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.150
let me take the complete part for my file.

164
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.260
So actually,

165
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.430
it is there in somewhere,

166
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.020
right?

167
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.480
So I'm going to provide complete part for my file en gays.

168
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.300
You are working with the windows.

169
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.820
That's why Please,

170
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.350
please provide two slashes in your path.

171
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.580
Yeah,

172
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.010
fine.

173
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.600
No,

174
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.420
you how in your hand you will see us.

175
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.450
We fight next unit to read it.

176
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.830
So guys,

177
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.030
forget about he see us.

178
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.080
We If you want to read a text file,

179
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.770
how we can read already We have seen our previous videos,

180
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.060
Right?

181
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.620
Let's say I'm goingto weapon you're filing.

182
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.410
Read more.

183
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.920
Your filings there in the variable corps require file.

184
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.060
I want to read the content than weapon your file and read more.

185
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.460
Finally,

186
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.650
just to close your file.

187
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.680
Now I want to get that later.

188
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.070
What is there with you?

189
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.880
Ever see us?

190
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.390
We file.

191
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.670
I mean with your file.

192
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.960
So content or data equals to simply a four dot I'm taking read lines.

193
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.950
Then let me print your data.

194
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:04.160
So I'm going to take one by one line from you are content.

195
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.310
Then I want to print that.

196
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.550
See the result?

197
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.760
Yes.

198
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.650
You're getting your data line by line,

199
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.900
right?

200
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.440
So you know,

201
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.290
if you want to remove the that space empty life,

202
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.150
you can strip it.

203
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.170
Yes,

204
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.550
you're getting But the thing is,

205
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.080
this is like a string.

206
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.870
String him into this.

207
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.850
The entire data is like a one column.

208
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.750
But we know CSU is nothing but tabler data.

209
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.820
So now you're not getting your data as a separate columns.

210
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.700
Your entire line you're getting as a one,

211
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:35.890
lane.

212
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.660
Only I should not get like that because it is a CS three.

213
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.190
I need to get in terms off columns right now.

214
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.840
What you have,

215
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.410
Louise.

216
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.850
First you have to really worry how the weapon you're filing read more,

217
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.370
then whatever that data you how inside off your file,

218
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.410
that data,

219
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:52.630
you know,

220
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.550
to convert it into rows and columns.

221
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.650
Anyway,

222
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.450
we're getting Rose,

223
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:05.600
but unit convert that data into columns that I want you to do is you need to parse unit to

224
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.950
send your data into CSP so that C s we will convert your data in terms off columns.

225
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.710
Right?

226
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:20.190
So now see that what I'm doing is see a sweet leader not interdict this model nt variable

227
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.070
Simply going today.

228
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.110
See a sweet See this week,

229
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.740
reader cr are simply see us.

230
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.040
We are date up equals to want you.

231
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.140
Ha!

232
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.790
To boo ees from CSP module.

233
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.850
Right?

234
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.250
Use a function call reader.

235
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.310
So from your file,

236
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.550
try to convert the world rose anywhere file is nothing but normal.

237
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.040
Finally also,

238
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.150
you're going to get line by line line is nothing but a hero in your CSB.

239
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.950
But that line consist off that line consist off columns.

240
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.070
So C s,

241
00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:00.900
we will automatically converted data in two columns right now.

242
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.750
See the result.

243
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.350
So,

244
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.620
guys,

245
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.480
in your data,

246
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.450
you have all liver rose off your CS three in terms off columns.

247
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.520
Let me take suppose if I directly print your data.

248
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.150
So that is a object.

249
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.230
But inside of that object,

250
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.710
you have number off Rosen on each.

251
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.340
Roy consist off some columns.

252
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.770
So if you want to see that for each in your data,

253
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.600
let's say I want to bring that.

254
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:26.880
No,

255
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.030
See,

256
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.050
that isn't what happened.

257
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.720
Oh,

258
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.750
for each and later.

259
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.480
Oh,

260
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.670
we close that right?

261
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.650
Yeah.

262
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:47.700
Let me close after this.

263
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.760
No.

264
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:51.930
See,

265
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.750
there you are able to get your data.

266
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.180
See,

267
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.890
each line has a list.

268
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.530
List means number off values,

269
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.230
separate values.

270
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.510
That means this is one column.

271
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.310
This is one column.

272
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.110
This is one called separate columns.

273
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:13.460
You're getting by separate columns you're getting are in case.

274
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.270
In case if you don't want to take this if you don't want to use your CS week,

275
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.630
right?

276
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:19.970
See,

277
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.680
what I'm doing is Let's say I want their content off my file,

278
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.200
you know?

279
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.590
Therefore,

280
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.830
Lord Reid lines without CSP model Also,

281
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:33.890
you can convert your data into number off columns.

282
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.350
See that I'm going to print.

283
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.710
First of all,

284
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.050
you want data line by line?

285
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.470
Yes.

286
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.070
You're getting Mark.

287
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:42.620
You know,

288
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.580
this is a a single rule in this.

289
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.910
So you have four columns.

290
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.310
Now,

291
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.540
if you ever hear this string So,

292
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.400
Mary o comma,

293
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.250
I can split it.

294
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.680
No,

295
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.790
simply actually,

296
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.330
this operation is doing by your CS three model.

297
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.710
That's it.

298
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.990
Now,

299
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.160
see,

300
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.500
that is a the same data on what you're getting from your CSE model.

301
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.950
Same thing you can able to get it.

302
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.410
But no need to do this.

303
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.900
A split operation by your cells that will taken care by U R.

304
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.420
C s we module.

305
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.150
That's why what we are doing is right.

306
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:21.190
See that no content is nothing but from your CS remodel.

307
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:29.540
Create a real object or Conforti work spring string off rose into some columns.

308
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.850
So for that you can go in this way.

309
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.520
That's it.

310
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.420
Now for each ing content,

311
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.350
right?

312
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.270
Oh,

313
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.870
let me bring each No see,

314
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.660
that is a You're finally need to close your file.

315
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.550
Don't forget aboard that and for dot Close not to.

316
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.870
Right?

317
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.140
So,

318
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.370
guys,

319
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:03.470
actually CSB splitting your data based on the limiter But we are not profiting anywhere

320
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:08.730
delimited right Then how you are seeing the model is splitting your line in tow A list

321
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:16.080
which consist off your values as columns we know by the Ford C s we will cause they're

322
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.310
separate routes Comma stays with nothing but comma separated values but in gives if you

323
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:26.750
want to mention to your CSP if you want to tell you your Sears we used this as a separator

324
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.980
millimeter.

325
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:34.350
You can mention de limiter is nothing bird comma not you can see the result,

326
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.560
right?

327
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:43.450
I suppose if I don't mention this on anywhere by default that you were day elementaries

328
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.250
comma by the fold with your Sears with that we see is well,

329
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.550
a gym.

330
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.790
That comatose operator.

331
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.660
No,

332
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.600
we have one more file,

333
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:49.850
right?

334
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.250
If you order this file New in four in their dilemma is not a comma.

335
00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:03.280
Let me try with that New in four you're getting your data has a one value on your list.

336
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.040
That means again you have one column I said these are four columns in each line,

337
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.350
right?

338
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.050
But they're getting as a one column.

339
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.080
Then in this case,

340
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.250
you need the limiter.

341
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.900
So for better practice,

342
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.830
always try to right the limit arise.

343
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.950
You were required thing.

344
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.260
I mean,

345
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.240
you just mentioned your dilemma Option as well.

346
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.570
Well,

347
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.250
converting your daytime too.

348
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.650
Rows and columns?

349
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.450
Not No,

350
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.410
it is not separated by a comma as a separate.

351
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.680
It is a piper as a separate.

352
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.030
No,

353
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.650
Let me run it.

354
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.050
What happened?

355
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.450
Sorry,

356
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:41.630
not millimeter.

357
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.370
So likewise.

358
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.190
What the what?

359
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:45.780
The memory.

360
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.260
How in the world sees refile If you know that you can able to Really?

361
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.380
What?

362
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:49.590
Data?

363
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.750
Using your fight on very easily in this way.

364
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.050
Right,

365
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.250
Fine.

366
00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:01.040
So this is the way how we can really work content from your CSB file.

367
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.980
So there's nothing,

368
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.990
is there just weapon?

369
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.210
You were CS we file in,

370
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.780
read more like a text file offer that you're going to convert your data into tabular data

371
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:21.000
