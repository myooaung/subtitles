00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
prince here,

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.230
we're going to work with ways,

3
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.150
not walk.

4
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.350
So this work is a matter from your ways on.

5
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.310
It is used to generate directly on file names in a doctor.

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.450
Three by walking.

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.700
So simply in case,

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.500
if you're familiar with the UNIX like systems Andi,

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.850
if you don't find a command,

10
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.190
right,

11
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.430
somebody If I run something like find some part name some store,

12
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.000
let's ism on dot Txt So what it will do,

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.680
you're find command.

14
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.580
Will recursive lee look for text files from the given part Means I didn't that you're

15
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.200
giving a part like this something like some X ray,

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.700
your views that you're giving then first you it will look for the work extra files in this

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.170
part.

18
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.530
Then if there are any directories,

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.280
let's say Howard,

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.730
everyone then automatically or find command will create a part called Home X wagered

21
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.100
everyone on in that also it will try to look for text files and I assume that in the

22
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.750
everyone also you how some directories,

23
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.350
let's say subject everyone.

24
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.950
Then in that location also,

25
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440
it will try to look for star.

26
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.240
I mean,

27
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.250
any text files.

28
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.690
So from the given part,

29
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.950
it is going to look for some text files.

30
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.560
And Rick Astley.

31
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.340
That means all the possible departs.

32
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.100
Whatever you have inside off your part becasue parts in all those parts it will try to look

33
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.950
for They were not txt files.

34
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.230
That's fine.

35
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.100
So the same way you are going to work with your waste,

36
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.950
not work as well.

37
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.370
But I guess if you don't know about fine command,

38
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.810
don't worry.

39
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.060
Here,

40
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.350
we're going to discuss about it.

41
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.660
And one more thing before going to start with your ways.

42
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.290
Don't work.

43
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.900
Please.

44
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.830
Please complete for Luke Concert from here.

45
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.740
So we have year loops in there upto this oral for Luke concepts.

46
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.170
Right?

47
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.420
You just go on walk.

48
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.920
Ah,

49
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.560
I mean,

50
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.950
going watch all these for Luke.

51
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.780
Concert first,

52
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420
then come back with your ways.

53
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.900
Not work,

54
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.650
then Only can understand effectively about your ways that work.

55
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.690
Fine days.

56
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.160
Let me take some part.

57
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.750
I'm going to take apart called Let me take.

58
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.730
Yeah,

59
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.760
this is a part.

60
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.080
Okay,

61
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.350
Now I'm going to eat a simple by transcript.

62
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.080
Okay.

63
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.310
Let me write any skip name.

64
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.630
How?

65
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.700
Given script name as well.

66
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.010
Start walking that the white.

67
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.560
Okay,

68
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.730
wait.

69
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.110
It's underscored walk toward the light.

70
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.020
Let me take apart.

71
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.150
Call this one.

72
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.860
I just know we cooperate.

73
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.420
We know we are working with the windows.

74
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.760
We had to provide those classes in your parts.

75
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.120
Otherwise,

76
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.580
because of special characters,

77
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.630
you may get at a right find No,

78
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.650
Let me directly print the war.

79
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.650
Always dot Walk.

80
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.770
Then you are given part and we are using here.

81
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.670
Wears model.

82
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.410
So before using it you how the imported honest,

83
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.820
better toe import at very first line.

84
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.620
That is actually better practice.

85
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.010
Fine.

86
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.790
No,

87
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.400
I'm running.

88
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.350
You're getting some output and this is a generator object.

89
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.970
You can also come what you're objecting to list because this output is finally going to

90
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.650
give a list.

91
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.690
That's why I'm trying to convert.

92
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.650
This has a list?

93
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.320
No,

94
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.500
See,

95
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.060
that would ward.

96
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:34.210
You are getting foster fall from your given part by Tunney's generating a list which

97
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.360
consists off couples and each double consist off three values Be clear Ways.

98
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.730
That walk is always going to generate a list.

99
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.390
A gender,

100
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.590
actually that is a gender drops.

101
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.150
Anybody can convert that India list.

102
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.160
No,

103
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.150
it is very easy.

104
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.160
If you remember in this way,

105
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.780
where's their walk is going to generate a list of first on that list consists off.

106
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.550
Couples.

107
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.300
See that this is a couple No,

108
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.050
on that double consist off three values.

109
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.850
Foster value is always the part which you have given.

110
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.950
And secondly,

111
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.790
civilised 30 is also a list.

112
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.250
On this list is list off directories in a given list in the given pot.

113
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.750
In this spot,

114
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.050
the list off Barrett is you will get here.

115
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.900
Here,

116
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.120
you will get the list off files in a given territory automatically.

117
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.750
Your python is separating.

118
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.060
Right?

119
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.450
You're list off the artisan list off files for you were given part,

120
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.130
right?

121
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.350
Let me take other part.

122
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:40.290
So I'm going to take apart called suppose programming some some different parts in that

123
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.550
bother.

124
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.680
How only files,

125
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.990
Right?

126
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.680
I anywhere.

127
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.640
How only one file.

128
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.980
If you want to create one more fine,

129
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.210
let me create extort.

130
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.710
Txt.

131
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.250
Why not be way something like that?

132
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.350
Now you have three files here.

133
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.550
Okay.

134
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.950
In self scripting,

135
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.150
let me take different apart.

136
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.390
No,

137
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.180
I'm going to run.

138
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.930
See the output Still you don't have any directories,

139
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.020
but you have the files in a given location.

140
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.250
Now you're fighting is able to identify them,

141
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.950
right?

142
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.230
No.

143
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.980
Let me take one.

144
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.500
Barrett three.

145
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.950
Here,

146
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:23.290
let me create directly some Hello territory right now in your programming.

147
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.450
You have a directory,

148
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.650
right?

149
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.810
Okay,

150
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.320
let me run.

151
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.250
You can see the output.

152
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.450
You're getting two parts.

153
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.690
One party's you're given part.

154
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.450
Be clear.

155
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.160
This is what your ways that walk is working.

156
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.360
Doing anywhere given part.

157
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.850
You have one badly on three files.

158
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.870
That is what we're Whatever the party or giving But you're fightin will recur silly Such

159
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.950
from their own words.

160
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.430
See,

161
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.350
Because hello is there If I hired hello part.

162
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.210
So this part,

163
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.650
then you can create one new part.

164
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.240
That's what by then is doing automatically This Hello is going to add to your given part

165
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.760
the new parties already having no New Delhi.

166
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.880
Everybody is there now in the nude.

167
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.340
Every part It is going to list adulterous and files.

168
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.030
As of now,

169
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.820
we don't know anything.

170
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.350
Let me create one more directly and see the result.

171
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.140
Sorry.

172
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.820
That is a file,

173
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.150
right?

174
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.750
Let me create one more data to be a It's solid there.

175
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.650
Yeah,

176
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.370
Those Okay,

177
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.750
fine.

178
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.550
Now let me return and see the output.

179
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.930
Nice.

180
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.870
If your daughter clearly for you were given part.

181
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.430
First of all,

182
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.760
you're fightin is giving this as your part on in that part of the list off territories.

183
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.650
And then in this partly stuff files that is over with one step.

184
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.750
But if you are this two directories to your given part,

185
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.450
what will happen,

186
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.750
you better report will coming up.

187
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.570
So,

188
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.050
yes,

189
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.850
you are able to form new.

190
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.560
There are three parts.

191
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.930
No pipeline will automatically farm that on in that.

192
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.720
If you have any dire this unless you don't list.

193
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.230
All right,

194
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.690
the same.

195
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.810
It is forming two parts with by one part.

196
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.170
Hello.

197
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.650
One part.

198
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.440
Suppose inside off your buyer.

199
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.660
Hello,

200
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.890
Iffy.

201
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.120
How one more directly.

202
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.950
Let me travel in tow.

203
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.190
My Hello.

204
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.570
As of now,

205
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.650
we don't know anything here,

206
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.680
right?

207
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.860
What I'm doing is first,

208
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.660
I'm going to create a file called Hello.

209
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.090
Not the way hello dot Txt right.

210
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.390
See previously with your hello directory part.

211
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.950
You don't have any files here right now.

212
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.150
I have a fight.

213
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.250
Two files,

214
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.950
right?

215
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.450
See that?

216
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.240
No.

217
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.150
Let me run our script and see the results.

218
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.810
Now you got to files automatically.

219
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.800
I'm here.

220
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.860
I don't know any territories.

221
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.010
Let me create a territory.

222
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.850
Hello one.

223
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.050
Now see the result.

224
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.730
You're going to get one day,

225
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.410
three year at the same time.

226
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.050
Because this is a directory.

227
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.640
This directory or fighting is going to add toe this part and it is going to form a new

228
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:22.970
territory part that means all possibility parts it is going to form automatically the part

229
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.870
which you have given from that.

230
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.450
See that?

231
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.750
Hello territory Holoband Eritrean that two files.

232
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.950
But this doctor tree you bad.

233
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.600
So this part,

234
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.700
then you can never toe.

235
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.430
I create new territory part.

236
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.490
That's what by then is doing.

237
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.420
And it is giving a list of files and directories.

238
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.770
But we don't have anything here.

239
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.450
Likewise,

240
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.340
if you do any part from that part,

241
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:52.050
you're fightin is automatically forming all possibility parts on each and every part.

242
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.350
It is going to provide a list off directories and least off files.

243
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.510
No,

244
00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.390
I assume there I'm so there what I would or could you are getting That is a list.

245
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.030
Be clear.

246
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.490
Basically,

247
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.110
this is the list.

248
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.480
A symbol,

249
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.500
right in the least.

250
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.110
If he observed you how apple This is a symbol,

251
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.350
right?

252
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.750
And this is upto this one only this is a foster couple in a list.

253
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.850
And this is the second couple.

254
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.740
And this is a charitable for the top.

255
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.030
See,

256
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.450
if we have a list,

257
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.610
right,

258
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.050
you can take one by one using your loop.

259
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:33.250
That's why what I'm doing is instead of blending in this way,

260
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.010
okay,

261
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:34.420
other ways,

262
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.150
I will do one thing.

263
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.700
I will keep this as a days again.

264
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.180
I will play for Lou for each anywhere list off ways,

265
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.150
not work.

266
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:50.450
But let me print your each and see the output.

267
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.320
But I do understand cigarettes let mean difference.

268
00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:06.150
Here them see anyone first output ways that walk part that lamb printing in there.

269
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.780
This is first to topple value in a word list.

270
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.280
This is the one value I can able to separate them using for loop Sam,

271
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.350
be second.

272
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.920
No,

273
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.850
I am bringing separately your couple values from your list.

274
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.950
And one more thing because this is a generator.

275
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.890
You're converting that into list just to see and to understand by you.

276
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.390
But vital can understand that we thought converting India list.

277
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:33.630
No,

278
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.130
see that I am removing this list list operation.

279
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.030
I'm the moving And if I run,

280
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.180
see the outward same old Put me in spite.

281
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.990
I can understand that.

282
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.630
What is there inside off your generator?

283
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.290
I should.

284
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.550
There is a general Rob sick,

285
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.550
but I'm gonna understand that.

286
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.690
That's why we're getting this all possible t couple values.

287
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.850
So we're getting four couples night.

288
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.260
Fine.

289
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.940
Now let me come into your Prince State.

290
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:05.780
May on after the output four couples are getting right days in a treatable If you're a jury

291
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:05.780
,

292
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.440
all three values one is the part.

293
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.010
And 2nd 1 is in this spot where the list off territories and 3rd 1 is in that part One of

294
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.250
the list off ice.

295
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.530
Yes,

296
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.190
You're getting right.

297
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.550
No.

298
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.700
If we have a three values in your trouble,

299
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.750
let me show you that.

300
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.490
Try to follow step by step.

301
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.750
Let's say I have a couple call in this way.

302
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.050
34 fight.

303
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.060
Then if you bring the X,

304
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.850
you're getting in this way.

305
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.430
But 345 directly.

306
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.510
I can assigned to three variables and see the way value our third value for X value.

307
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:48.920
You can unpack your couple that it lee into a number of variables.

308
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.970
But while ascending in this way the values which he how in triple the number of values

309
00:11:53.970 --> 00:12:00.260
should be the number of variables so that he can back know What I'm doing is,

310
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.450
if you have the euro put in your script,

311
00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.520
the 1st 1 is some given part,

312
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:05.850
right?

313
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.280
Our assume that this is a route part.

314
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.040
I mean,

315
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.050
what are the party are giving that just assumption Route pot there in that part of that

316
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.450
interest list in the part files list.

317
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.450
So not this is a couple.

318
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.400
What are the value you're printing?

319
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.340
Using your for loop each and every valley with a couple.

320
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.600
Know what I'm doing is directly here itself.

321
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.450
I'm unpacking.

322
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.310
Senior off each.

323
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.970
What I'm taking is your root part.

324
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.290
Directories list under and fights list.

325
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.080
You can also take lengthy variables.

326
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:43.170
I don't want to take in this way like rule that it plays list files list.

327
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.140
I don't want take this lengthy variable simply I want to take,

328
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.550
like,

329
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.850
root on.

330
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.270
These are not the fixer variables.

331
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.550
You can take any variables,

332
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.180
Dr.

333
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.450
Now,

334
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.340
if I print all these three,

335
00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.930
you're getting your trouble right now.

336
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.830
What I'm doing is I'm printing only are then you can expect from each and every couple.

337
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.970
You're going to print this first of part.

338
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:11.150
That means all the possible departs You are printing a little bit on.

339
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:17.740
You can see the output you're spending on us all possibility parts now I want to bring to

340
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.930
each and every part.

341
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.760
What are the files?

342
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.450
List Only finds list the path in that part.

343
00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.350
What are the files?

344
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.690
See that article?

345
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:25.800
My,

346
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:25.990
you.

347
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.050
That's it.

348
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.070
If you how you will get it.

349
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.610
If you don't know,

350
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.550
it won't display that.

351
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.050
Now I want to get each part in that part.

352
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.150
Only directories list.

353
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.550
Do that.

354
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.550
Fine.

355
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.150
Okay.

356
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.240
If it is fine now,

357
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.150
let's come back with again files.

358
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:54.850
See the output,

359
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.740
the pot from your first guys.

360
00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.150
First of all,

361
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.770
you're getting your given part in that part list off files.

362
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.750
I have one more option here.

363
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:10.050
Top down equals two false.

364
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.250
And in this case,

365
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.240
what is all put just after that You are the worst thing.

366
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:22.370
You're output by then is going to get from bottom to top values by default.

367
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.160
It is always true.

368
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.190
Top down is true.

369
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.240
Even if you're right.

370
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.880
No bottom.

371
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.670
Even if you don't write.

372
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.170
No problem.

373
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.060
See if your idea or getting supposed by.

374
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.610
Okay,

375
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.430
first he that is mighty.

376
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.630
For if you want to make it as a top donors.

377
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.000
False.

378
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.300
I mean,

379
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:37.930
I want to get out.

380
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.480
Put from down to falls in your directory structures about I think that this is given

381
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.970
directly in that house,

382
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.500
some number off territories and then number of files again.

383
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.190
This you have some directories on the files again in this territory.

384
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.290
How?

385
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.150
Some number of charities and files.

386
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.010
So this is top down in this way.

387
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.650
Your partner will look by default.

388
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.650
I guess If you want to bring to your parts from don't go top,

389
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.010
then you have didn't make it up.

390
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.550
Don't value s fall so that the fighting will you first this list then come back then coming

391
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.550
.

392
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.750
But then your top.

393
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.180
Nothing where it's not a I mean not require majority.

394
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:16.610
If you want,

395
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.900
you can mention this option,

396
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.550
right?

397
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.350
That's fine.

398
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.150
Okay,

399
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.750
Now you are getting your path in that party.

400
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.960
How?

401
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.950
Your files.

402
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:33.750
Right now I want to print it up part which consist off some files.

403
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.500
I don't want to print all the parts which are not having fights.

404
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.080
Then what?

405
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.650
I will go see that if leant off your files if it is not in Khost.

406
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.250
Ojito,

407
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.020
If we did,

408
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.050
you know I don't want to print.

409
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.580
If it is not equal to zero,

410
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.650
then only print.

411
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.720
See that you are getting only two parts which are having your files previously got four

412
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.010
parts,

413
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:57.290
right?

414
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.150
But now you're getting only two butts because I have given a condition,

415
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.220
printed the files,

416
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.280
sprinted up part and files which are having,

417
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.450
I mean the part which are having some files.

418
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.700
So what I'm doing is the first of all.

419
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.060
You know,

420
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.760
you can able to find your list of files in a given part that I'm finding.

421
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.190
Lend.

422
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.950
If length is not equal to zero missing at least one file,

423
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.850
then I am printing that night.

424
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.750
Fine.

425
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:22.780
No,

426
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.150
I don't want toe print.

427
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.650
I don't want to print my files in it as a list.

428
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:34.050
I want to bring my files one by one.

429
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.560
First off,

430
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.370
what I'm doing is I'm printing my route part right now.

431
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.220
Let me print for separately or files.

432
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.060
I'm going with step by step the same way you just practice and update output.

433
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.560
I'm getting my route pot.

434
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.480
I mean,

435
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:48.840
what?

436
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.610
These two files,

437
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.850
whatever the party is there,

438
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.740
then for this files,

439
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.630
whatever the part part on its files,

440
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.210
I'm getting no,

441
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.580
I want to get I want to display one by one file under.

442
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.560
We were given part.

443
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.970
Nothing is there you can take for loop here again for each file in your f Just simply print

444
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.760
your each file.

445
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.120
See that put now?

446
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.660
What I want to do is I want to get complete part for my each and every file.

447
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.640
It's very,

448
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.350
very important.

449
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.780
I want to get each on their for each and every file.

450
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.550
I want to get complete part.

451
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.060
So you guys,

452
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.390
if you clearly absorb in this part only how your files,

453
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.700
right?

454
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.610
If I aren't this part to your each file,

455
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.050
you're going to form complete part.

456
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.930
So this scenario is very,

457
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.480
very important in your real family.

458
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:50.380
Nothing is that that you can print where is not part about join even route.

459
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.290
Then you are filed.

460
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.780
It's very simple.

461
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.450
Sit output.

462
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.550
You're getting your route part in the time.

463
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.260
In your part?

464
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.810
No,

465
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.050
I'm getting comfort part for me.

466
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.050
Each and every file,

467
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.050
right?

468
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:12.350
Just for your differentiation between different parts I'm writing here hyphens No.

469
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.950
See the output.

470
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.880
This is your main part in there.

471
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.950
The files.

472
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.680
But I'm getting with complete part.

473
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.630
That's what actually I need It's very,

474
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.450
very important.

475
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.550
Then second box.

476
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.350
And in that bother how list of files.

477
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.260
Right.

478
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.290
Fine.

479
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:31.650
So,

480
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:31.900
guys,

481
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.470
whatever that concept were done in this video,

482
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.800
this is applicable even for what?

483
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.050
UNIX like systems.

484
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.240
Okay,

485
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.340
so in the next video,

486
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.050
we'll see with the practice with real time practice.

487
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.170
Okay.

488
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:46.960
Okay.
