1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
friends here.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,520
We're going to discuss about the simple functions with arguments.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,750
Let me explain this with an example.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,090
Let me open my any there.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,130
I'm taking a script name called Functions with simple arguments.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:15,850
Don't be white,

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,950
Right?

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,890
See,

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,310
I have a small requirement.

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,350
This agenda that requirement days read a number on Inclement eight by 10.

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:31,750
So first I'm writing with Toto Functions Concept Let me take number cause too.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:39,570
Input and very were number logic.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,480
Then I want to find result as number blessed in.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,010
Then I want to print that reserve.

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,640
Print your reserve These something like that.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,490
You can take anything.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:03,970
That's it right Now let me go to my command line and let me run it before running.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,310
This is he was kept.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,750
I'm running this script.

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,790
See the result I'm passing.

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,090
Suppose some 20.

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,840
Then you have to get your or put us 30.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,110
Yes,

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,790
you are getting No.

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,130
There's a simple pie transcript.

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,650
But what I want to do is I want to convert this entire court in terms off functions.

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,490
So first step.

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,750
What I'm doing is our intent to you're given number and then printing.

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm writing under one function right.

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,950
So you know we know.

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,060
What?

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,280
If you wanted to find a function?

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,950
Yes.

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,050
Do you find get reside?

35
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,170
That is up.

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,090
Was my function on under this function I'm writing these two lines and finally simply right

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,090
.

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,790
Britain None.

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,850
That's it.

40
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,650
No,

41
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,260
I'm reading that.

42
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,650
I mean,

43
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,810
I want to get my number.

44
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,200
Yes,

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm getting right now.

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,090
I'm running.

47
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,070
I'm providing.

48
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,630
But you're not getting in outward.

49
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,290
That isn't Is your logic is there under get result function?

50
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,570
But you are not calling that.

51
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,190
If you call,

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,560
then only that logical excuse.

53
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,060
Now,

54
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,800
after reading a number now I want to call that lousy right now.

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,750
See the core.

56
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,050
So you are reading your number.

57
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,890
After that,

58
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,050
you're calling you a la Z.

59
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,010
Now it will execute.

60
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,470
No,

61
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,110
I'm running.

62
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,350
I'm giving some number four.

63
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,550
You're getting result as 14 right?

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,570
No,

65
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,280
actually,

66
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,550
to really one number on to exclude your logic.

67
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,670
You have two lines.

68
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,050
Go These two lines also I want right under one more function.

69
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,390
Yes,

70
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,050
you can write it.

71
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,850
Let me do one thing,

72
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,910
Mike.

73
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,650
What I'm taking That's it.

74
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,590
Right on.

75
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,150
I'm running.

76
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,150
You're not getting any output.

77
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,870
The reason is now your entire Lawzi reading a number under,

78
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,680
then finding your result.

79
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,850
Both are there under two different functions.

80
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,460
Right?

81
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,750
So in your my court you're calling you are you're reading your remember and then you're

82
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,250
calling this function No.

83
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,350
Two X cured this Lawzi,

84
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,440
You need to call this function to exclude this large beginning to call this function right

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,440
?

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,040
So that's why what I'm doing is somewhere I'm calling my core.

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,310
That's a no injured off my court.

88
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,780
If we take it as a main,

89
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,650
that's good.

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,360
You can take any function name,

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,750
but there is the simple way.

92
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,910
Take your function name as mean so that you can easily understand that Maine is nothing.

93
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,150
But from there you're going to exclude your la Z.

94
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,780
So it's not the mandatory to take your function name as main.

95
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,570
But if we take,

96
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,220
then it's good.

97
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,360
That's it like no,

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,050
previously we done our court and we're getting or put Now.

99
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,100
If I do that,

100
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,950
you will get another.

101
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,970
That this number is not define why you're getting this era where you're getting this error

102
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,920
in line number two.

103
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,630
What is that?

104
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,260
While finding result,

105
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,650
this number table is unable to find by your python.

106
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,250
What is the reason for that?

107
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,330
See,

108
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,580
numb Now it is there under main function.

109
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,560
It is one function right under function.

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,750
You define a number able,

111
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,190
then this variably space victor dysfunction.

112
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,020
How can you access in this way function now this numb.

113
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,450
This known variable right is specific to this main function.

114
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,590
How can you access inside off?

115
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,250
Get dessert.

116
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,450
So that's what you do.

117
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,750
You need to make your variable as global.

118
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,250
Now it will work.

119
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:07,120
But making your variables as global is not that much good.

120
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,790
Whenever If you have a requirement,

121
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,650
then only will do that.

122
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,830
A requirement means suppose.

123
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,650
Assume that number able.

124
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,020
Suppose in my function in my courthouse,

125
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,310
um,

126
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,940
10 functions in all functions I need to use suppose let's say number then.

127
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,430
Aiken,

128
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:31,500
simply make it as a global so that I can access that number table in all the functions as

129
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:31,640
off.

130
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,110
No.

131
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,860
Right.

132
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,150
I need this non variable only inside off my one function get result function.

133
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:44,650
That's why don't make your variables as global whenever if there is no requirement,

134
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,850
if you have a some specific requirement,

135
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,430
then only will make it as a global.

136
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,750
We will see that situation,

137
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,830
right?

138
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,050
So forget about no global then how you can send you are number ableto this get result

139
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,110
function simple Why are you calling?

140
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,950
You just pass a year number now you're passing your number value,

141
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,050
right?

142
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,650
No see that I am passing that right But if I run that you're going to get an error that is

143
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:22,010
get result takes Jiro positional arguments but one was given Get result is a function right

144
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,270
So here get result function here nothing is there but you are sending one value So whenever

145
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,850
if you're passing you are variable value In this way he had also you should how some

146
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:41,900
variable to store Whatever the value coming from here that means here redefining variable

147
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,190
right?

148
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,450
Let me different here also some variable Then it will match Let me take your also on them

149
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:53,020
But he can take any variable No need to take number Also you can take any variable like

150
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,170
value like no whatever the variable you define that variable is available inside off this

151
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,650
function.

152
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,580
Right,

153
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,550
so as off No,

154
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,550
I'm running in this way.

155
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,800
Yes,

156
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,290
you are getting but see while calling your passing numb means you're not passing numb

157
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,780
variable.

158
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,620
You're passing the value off numb guys from this line,

159
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,130
only the valley will be possibly here and here we're cup capturing that value in terms off

160
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,850
numb variable.

161
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,790
Right now,

162
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,290
what I'm doing is I'm not moving stuff.

163
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,730
Mom,

164
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,670
I'm taking a value now.

165
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,630
This value variably is available inside of this function now instead off.

166
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:34,910
No.

167
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,290
Now you have to take value.

168
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,310
That's it.

169
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,420
Now,

170
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,600
see,

171
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:49,250
that is a It's working like So if you pass your variables well calling,

172
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:56,620
then that variables are called arguments on the very blue cheese defined in your defined

173
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,290
function defined function.

174
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,260
I mean to be off some very year it is there,

175
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,150
and this variable is called barometer.

176
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,350
But I mean,

177
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,150
those are traditional arguments.

178
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,490
Why?

179
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,810
We're calling them as a positional arguments.

180
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,820
See,

181
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,350
as off me how only one variable.

182
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,050
That's why you can't understand what is the position.

183
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,350
Let me take simply one more court.

184
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,750
But it is just for addition.

185
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:35,460
Let me like that lamb rating.

186
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,550
You are ah,

187
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,040
logic without functions.

188
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,470
Let's say number.

189
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:46,450
Enter your first number,

190
00:08:46,450 --> 00:09:04,370
then number B and turkey were second number then I am finding result,

191
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,610
you please be.

192
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,290
Then I'm printing the result.

193
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,650
The addition off year.

194
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,570
All right,

195
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,250
be he's You were reserved,

196
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,280
right?

197
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,610
First,

198
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,030
let me tell,

199
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,950
you can see the output.

200
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm passing four and fight and you're getting results as mine.

201
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,250
Like that's fine.

202
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,020
No,

203
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,390
same way I want to find subtraction as well.

204
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,120
Let's say this is additional result then subtraction result.

205
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
I am finding a minus bi.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,770
Then I want to read the subtraction off.

207
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,350
You are yea be.

208
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,220
He's subtraction.

209
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,780
Lizard.

210
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,250
That's it,

211
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,650
right?

212
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,050
34 You're getting what happened?

213
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,070
Okay,

214
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,250
he had auditioned Result?

215
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,130
Yeah,

216
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,750
it's fine.

217
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,450
You're getting right.

218
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,300
No,

219
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,750
of course,

220
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,860
this is a classic without functions,

221
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,330
but no,

222
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,850
I want to convert these and do functions concert.

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,640
So reading A and B right?

224
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,850
I will do from main function.

225
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,630
So I'm taking this as a main function inside off main function.

226
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,790
I'm reading my E and B values.

227
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,340
Right.

228
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,010
Then I'm going to take these two lines.

229
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,900
All right?

230
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,800
I want to give the name for that as a tradition.

231
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,600
Get tradition.

232
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:58,150
That's it.

233
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,790
So I'm finding for addition here.

234
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:08,870
Same way remaining two lines I want Oh,

235
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,220
right.

236
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,950
The one more function that is get subtraction.

237
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,050
Let me take these two lines.

238
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:24,980
Let me write.

239
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,310
Finally return.

240
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,240
None on in main function.

241
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,770
Also,

242
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,350
we hold it in your fine.

243
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,930
No,

244
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,630
let me Donny no put.

245
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,680
Because now,

246
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,020
if you observe me out three functions know where we're calling any function,

247
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,860
how it will excuse.

248
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,230
Right?

249
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,890
Anyway,

250
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,850
our invention is our starting logic should be from here.

251
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,560
That's why I need to call this main after come after defending all your functions somewhere

252
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,950
here I'm calling that.

253
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,760
That's a right.

254
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,200
No,

255
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,550
see,

256
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,810
I'm running.

257
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,950
Let me do one thing.

258
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,850
I will remove empty lines.

259
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,580
So this is your la Z.

260
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:15,750
Now I am running that under number 34 You're not getting in output.

261
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,710
So we are reading year and B values where we're calling Get our get result.

262
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,860
Know where we're calling.

263
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,430
That's why you're not getting in output now.

264
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,150
I want to get tradition,

265
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,480
but also subtraction.

266
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,550
Then I need to call those functions right,

267
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,020
but here will get an error but observed that while finding addition year and B,

268
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,280
you're getting another look or name your is not defined.

269
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,750
Why?

270
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,070
See you are year and be variables.

271
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,710
Are there under main function.

272
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,310
That means their local variable that specific to this main function.

273
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,650
How you can use that in get art forms or get subtraction function.

274
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,210
So if you want to use those variable values you need toe past them so that function

275
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,580
whenever if you're calling right No,

276
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,550
get Ardika Amobi,

277
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,720
get some traction.

278
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,740
You come will be on variables.

279
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,780
What about available value you're sending You need to capture here also.

280
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,200
That's why in your defined funds and also you die hard to write a comma be then you

281
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,820
commodity That's it,

282
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,950
right?

283
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,740
No,

284
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,550
let me money.

285
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,990
I'm giving number four and seven.

286
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:36,360
See the result Tradition 11 subtraction Ministry Know what I'm doing?

287
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,920
Is wife getting subtraction?

288
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,550
I'm passing become a year so previously you got result as minus 344 and seven.

289
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,800
Now I'm running.

290
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,550
I'm giving same values and see the result what you're getting Plus three you're getting

291
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,810
because we change in the position.

292
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,480
See that if you change your position based on that question only these values will be

293
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,440
assigned to your be evil.

294
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,950
You know you're assigning to you usually are assigning Toby,

295
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,930
right?

296
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,880
So based on this position,

297
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,050
you're getting values here.

298
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,960
That's what these are called.

299
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,850
Traditional arguments are simply parameters.

300
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,850
Right now you are fine with the traditional arguments.

301
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,420
Like on one more thing.

302
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,910
We already discussed that whenever if you're calling function,

303
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,180
you're passing year and be variables on,

304
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,610
we are assigning them to year and be you need to understand Here.

305
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,070
Yeah.

306
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,600
Valley will be assigned to eat this year and be valley will be assigned to this be same day

307
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,300
this year.

308
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,390
Valley will be assigned to you on this.

309
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,700
Be really will be assigned Toby on these where the bulls are were using inside off this on

310
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,180
this year.

311
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,270
And this be not from here.

312
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,350
They are from this parentheses.

313
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,690
Be clear this year.

314
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,150
Bees are from this from this place.

315
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,850
Whatever you define here,

316
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,560
Dr Variables,

317
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:10,600
you can use inside off your function site and while calling your passing a comma be right.

318
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:10,940
No,

319
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,030
no.

320
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,090
Today gave him a B.

321
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:19,480
You can take some Pekka McCue Also let me dig become a que so you're taking P And you know

322
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,850
there are no more year and be now wearables,

323
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,000
rpm que no,

324
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,650
you have to write your logic in terms off.

325
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,190
Be on cue.

326
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,630
No,

327
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,860
where we held here and B,

328
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,000
we have only p and Q the same way you also you can take Wanted to take a b r P Q.

329
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,740
We can take some,

330
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:38,950
um,

331
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,050
comma and no problem.

332
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,550
The only thing What will happen whenever If you're calling your for insurance,

333
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,790
we are turning the values.

334
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,990
This festival will be assigned to first variable Second Valley will be assigned to second

335
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,360
variable here also.

336
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,980
Yea,

337
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,940
verily will be assigned to young be well it will be assigned again Now inside off your get

338
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,950
subtraction There no more yell Be now you have in terms off your money and your valuables

339
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:12,560
That's a Let me more If I completely on let me run this core You're going to get same

340
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,500
results Do that right.

341
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,950
So be clear.

342
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,020
Yeah,

343
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,150
and be our specific domain function.

344
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,880
P and Q are specific to get our function,

345
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,100
your money and North Pacific get subtraction function right While calling in this way only

346
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,650
the values will be assigned to your variables respectively.

347
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:43,460
First the value first variable second value to second variable Not okay.

348
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,880
No.

349
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,310
Suppose I how badly values called nine and 10 I want to find this attraction for this.

350
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,760
Yes,

351
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,580
we confined.

352
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,850
Get subtraction.

353
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,350
My Uncle Martin directly control your values also.

354
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,830
Now,

355
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,850
if I do in this way,

356
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,950
let me come in these two functions.

357
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,250
No,

358
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,100
I'm not reading year and B values in my hand.

359
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,380
Gently.

360
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,580
How values nine and 10.

361
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes.

362
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
You can call yourself,

363
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,910
get subtraction or get a hard function.

364
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,310
Whatever it may be any but those two are taking to value Speaker Mark.

365
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,990
You are am coming.

366
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,950
And that's why I'm passing to values.
