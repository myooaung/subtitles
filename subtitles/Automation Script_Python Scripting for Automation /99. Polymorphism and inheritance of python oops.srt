1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,890
friends here We're discussing about inheritance and polymorphism concept off.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:06,400
Oops.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,880
First,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,390
let me go with polymorphism.

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,120
Basically,

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,130
we know Polly means many so in spite on polymorphism allows us to define same methods in

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,150
different classes.

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:22,630
I mean you can take same method name in different classes even though you could define same

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,850
matter name in different classes there is no overlap.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:35,120
This process is also known as matter bull riding simply we are or writing same 1/3 in

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,080
different classes.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,410
Yes,

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,230
that is possible.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,090
That is a load in your python And we can also use this polymorphism concept in your

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,060
inheritance as well.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,870
We will see that while discussing about the inheritance First,

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,000
let me explain about your polymorphism with a simple example Let me open my sublime texture

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,380
later.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:01:00,550
So here I am defending two classes Let's say Tomcat and I am defining Ah constructor method

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:07,980
Here the purpose of constructor Middle East toe assign Let's say Tomcat home and Russian by

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,430
default.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,250
Whenever we are creating an object we know insulation my thirties a contractor matter.

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,230
It will execute by default whenever if you create an object right?

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,240
So simply I'm writing home.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:27,350
Then let's say self lord worship because toe question right then finally right.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,410
I'm not expecting any return value from this mother.

27
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,950
That's why Simply I'm writing the done None.

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:41,550
Let me read one more method called display a little simply I'm writing.

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,080
This is from Tomcat class on here simply.

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,050
I'm displaying brain sell for door,

31
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,550
whom then print self door.

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,850
What's in?

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,450
That's it,

34
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,400
then from this function also,

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
I mean from this matter also,

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,750
I'm not expecting an incident where you simply and write England unknown.

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,250
Let me take same matter.

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:15,850
But here I am taking Web server class name Let's say a party.

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,200
Yes,

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,570
we created two classes,

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,450
but if you have there,

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,510
here are taken insulation method on here also are taken Insulation method display matter

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,020
common.

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,950
Bought the classes.

45
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,800
No problem.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,220
It is allowed in your fight on it is allowed in your pie tone.

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,890
They see if I run this court,

48
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,850
you're not getting any better Anyway.

49
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,750
Let me clean object from your Tomcat on from Europe Party.

50
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,650
Let's say Tomcat absurd equals two Tomcat.

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,320
So why creating an object?

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,600
You're having insulation matter which is expecting to arguments.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,340
Let's a human version then let me pass.

54
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,720
That lets a home sometime care nine And then I'm taking suppose watching us some $7 6

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,350
something like that.

56
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:13,950
Then let me create Apache object also from your apology class.

57
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,010
So it is also using insulation method.

58
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,140
That means it is expecting to arguments.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,450
We need to pass them while creating an object.

60
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,690
Let's say watching her some put out four like me.

61
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,720
Run this and see the results.

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,650
There is no error.

63
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,850
That's fine.

64
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,410
No,

65
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,080
I wanted this to the details off Tomcat object and also displayed The deal's off about the

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,450
object?

67
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,650
No,

68
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,670
in Tom could object.

69
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,660
We are dis limiter.

70
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,250
If I call this display matter with respect Tomcat object then it will call from here only

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,150
so that you are going to get information from from for your tomcat object.

72
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,880
See,

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,520
I simply we define same maternal name in different classes.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,350
No problem.

75
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,800
Even though if you take your pie don't don't get confused,

76
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,810
it will work perfectly.

77
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:58,940
See,

78
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,850
there is a This is from Tomcat class,

79
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,650
right?

80
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,540
Let me call from a body object display.

81
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,000
Minter know what you're going to get?

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,650
See the result?

83
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,170
This is from Yes,

84
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,050
I D I hold it in?

85
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,450
That's like copyright.

86
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,640
Let me here.

87
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,660
Modified Apache.

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,690
What the place is.

89
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:23,960
Actually,

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,500
we help Same court.

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,710
Now let me run this and see that is a whenever.

92
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,520
If you're calling from Tomcat observed display matter,

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,940
it is going toe executing your this display matter.

94
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,250
Right?

95
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,830
And whenever we feel calling from a party absurdities executing the metal,

96
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,030
which is there Nobody chapter.

97
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,550
That's it.

98
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,190
Even though if you wore right your matter in different classes your fight on don't get

99
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,950
confused.

100
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,980
And this is simply polymorphism defining,

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,710
Say matter.

102
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,750
Name in different classes is nothing but polymorphism Night.

103
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,910
That's fine.

104
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,550
Now our next to concert,

105
00:04:59,550 --> 00:04:59,890
please.

106
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,650
In evidence.

107
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,960
See,

108
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,310
inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new class,

109
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,150
known as a tailor class on that is based upon an existing class that is parent class.

110
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,670
Nothing is there.

111
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,350
This concept is very similar to our,

112
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,350
um like human life.

113
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,950
Suppose we are in herding Dean's from or parents,

114
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,580
right?

115
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,470
That is a concept.

116
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:29,760
Here,

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,080
let me explain this with escapes American under strain.

118
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,750
Now let me take one more strip.

119
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,960
So here I am,

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,720
saving it as a in her does not be white.

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,750
So that is faster thing.

122
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:50,450
Let me take same script only on if I open this group here.

123
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,960
Okay?

124
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,350
So if you have during these two glasses there are common methods.

125
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,320
Let's up at this display.

126
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,750
Minted,

127
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,640
See for display.

128
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,790
May 3rd already.

129
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,880
It is there in Tomcat.

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,630
Why should I read the court here?

131
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,150
If you observe and by sin taxes Same.

132
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,370
No,

133
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,250
here and here.

134
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,950
If it is similar,

135
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,770
why should I write?

136
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,050
Same scored in the second class,

137
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,120
right?

138
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
So in that case,

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,350
what I can do is I can inherit Tomcat class in my A party so that I can use display matter

140
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,610
for a party object for a budget class.

141
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,520
How it is possible Just after that I am removing display mother from your second class.

142
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,940
And if you want to inherit any glass injured off this object,

143
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,920
you have to write the particular class name.

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,650
That's it.

145
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,450
No,

146
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,350
the meaningful disease you are in hurting these two methods in this class.

147
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,740
And if you have the same method,

148
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,630
is there here and here?

149
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,240
No problem.

150
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,550
Even though if you're having first to preferences in this Apache,

151
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,050
this one,

152
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,950
if it is not there in a party than on it will take this installation method that is called

153
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,750
polymorphism.

154
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,050
That's fine.

155
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,070
Now,

156
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,570
see,

157
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:21,760
Let me create your two objects right now.

158
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,350
Remove this print because you are you hurting this,

159
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,440
Tom,

160
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,050
get in Google.

161
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,210
These are Budgie class now.

162
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,480
I created two objects.

163
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,120
It's fine.

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,950
There is no better,

165
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,180
right?

166
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,590
No.

167
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,050
See,

168
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,360
I am calling your tomcat,

169
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,450
observed or display.

170
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,750
Then you're getting Tomcat doodles.

171
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,790
If you're observing a party,

172
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,340
we don't.

173
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,450
How We don't how this play matter,

174
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,050
but I'm trying to do that.

175
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,500
A party,

176
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,580
object or display.

177
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,350
You're getting your information,

178
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,370
Your display material executing evenly If you don't have this limited here because we

179
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,960
inherited this Tomcat class in tow,

180
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,530
Apache,

181
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,520
so that whatever the matters are there in this tomcat,

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,740
all methods are valued in this apology.

183
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,550
Object also.

184
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,980
But initial Asian mother is already there.

185
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,180
Here,

186
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,690
in here.

187
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,750
That's right.

188
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,180
References for this installation,

189
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,390
Mother.

190
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,250
Not for this.

191
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,420
Right.

192
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:28,090
So these the way how we can inherit a matter off one class into other class.

193
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,750
What we are doing simply,

194
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,880
while creating your second class,

195
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,910
we are writing in place off parentheses in place,

196
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,620
off objects were writing.

197
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,470
You're required class from which you need to inherit from which you need toe import The

198
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,750
methods that class name hard to write so that the matters which are available in the world

199
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,550
this class will be available with this object also.

200
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,420
I mean,

201
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,470
what are the other they are going to get from this class?

202
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,850
Also,

203
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,940
that's a That is the simple way to understand inheritance concert.

204
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,860
Anyway,

205
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,950
you will get more idea while writing our real time scripts.

206
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,190
Okay,

207
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,290
so finally,

208
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,890
what is that?

209
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,350
One days by using inheritance?

210
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,250
Simple.

211
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,090
This is sales.

212
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,750
You from duplicating a lot off course.

213
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,150
Suppose you are defining same matter in different classes on with the same court.

214
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,450
Why should we repeat same court in different classes,

215
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,640
defining one class and heard that class into your current class so that he can use the

216
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,470
previous class matters in the current class?

217
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,350
Also that is that one day.

218
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,530
And one more thing.

219
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,130
Yeah.

220
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,220
Last point for a party.

221
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,350
We are inheriting methods from Tomcat.

222
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,120
Now here I can say,

223
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,390
Tomcat is the parent,

224
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,150
The class and Apache is the chili class.

225
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,320
Our stomach that is the super class and approaches the subclass you don't remember that

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,870
that names parent Tomcat or super classes?

227
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,350
Tomcat.

228
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,430
A party is the chili class.

229
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,310
Our surplus.

230
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,790
Right.

231
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,360
That's your case.

232
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,350
Thank you for watching this simple video.
