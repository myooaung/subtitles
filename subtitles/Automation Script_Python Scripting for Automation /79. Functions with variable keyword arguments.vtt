00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
friends here.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.800
We're discussing about two functions with variable length keyword.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.200
Basic arguments.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.560
See,

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.850
already we know what is a cure based argument.

6
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.910
Right?

7
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.500
See,

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.920
let me Ah,

9
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.180
start with that already.

10
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.740
We know that,

11
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.120
right?

12
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.550
Let me defend a new script.

13
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:27.200
Variable Lend keyword based arguments.

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.150
Right.

15
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.250
See,

16
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.050
I am displaying a function.

17
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.870
I mean,

18
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.250
I'm writing a display function.

19
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.700
Let's say a comma.

20
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.550
Be then just simply I'm reading your value on then bring Toby value like No,

21
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.140
let me read it online.

22
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.700
Now,

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.190
while calling your function,

24
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.470
you can pass in this way,

25
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.050
right?

26
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.610
It will work at the same time.

27
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.220
You remember,

28
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.450
Not only will discuss your based arguments,

29
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.150
I can write because toe fight.

30
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.130
Yeah,

31
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.850
because before no see the result are I can also start with the based on key.

32
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.950
I'm passing my value.

33
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.850
Right.

34
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.850
So this is called cured based arguments in your functions.

35
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.350
It's working right,

36
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.750
but our concept ease very well.

37
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.000
And keyword based arguments Variable length cure based arguments means next time whenever

38
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.020
if I'm calling,

39
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.350
I'm also passing one x travel you Let's say in this way.

40
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.190
No,

41
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.170
we we know that our function is ready to accept only a comma B two arguments,

42
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.960
But we're passing three arguments based on keys now it's not ready to accept right now.

43
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.390
Again,

44
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.960
I think,

45
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.710
is that it's a It's again like a variable and arguments only.

46
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.660
But based on keys novena briefly.

47
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.380
How a variable length off arguments.

48
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.960
So this time I'm passing two arguments here.

49
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.240
I'm passing three arguments,

50
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.060
but based on keys So based on keys,

51
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.280
if you're passing variable and arguments toe,

52
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.770
handle them in your function we have a syntax like like this two stars keyword,

53
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.180
basic arguments,

54
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.410
keyword based argument.

55
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.590
That's why I'm taking simply care.

56
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.610
RG But he can take anything simply.

57
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.700
This is a variable wherever live I'm taking K are cured based arguments right now Let me

58
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.690
bring what you are getting because off this star star So what is the k r?

59
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.150
No,

60
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.750
right?

61
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.650
See,

62
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.250
that is a you know we are not passing business keys dysfunction right now.

63
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.440
See,

64
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.590
that isn't here.

65
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.630
We are passing based on keys whenever if you pass based on keys and whenever If you have a

66
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.960
syntax in your function with the two stars,

67
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.780
any variable,

68
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.120
then that we're really leading.

69
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.350
But it did study which consists off key and value paid presentation.

70
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.100
Already,

71
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.450
we know what is a key and value paid representation.

72
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.350
That's what it is.

73
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.150
Do that reading Basin key and valuable,

74
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.450
right?

75
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.360
No.

76
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.760
Next time I can pass not only year you can take anything.

77
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.530
Let's say I'm taking X equals to fight.

78
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.990
Why it goes too high,

79
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.390
then some dirty coast to some number,

80
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.010
then particles to root.

81
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.360
Something like that are user request to root and shoot off part?

82
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.330
No.

83
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.050
See the result.

84
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.110
So inside off your function you are getting the passage.

85
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.410
Whatever the arguments,

86
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.910
you are passing based on keys,

87
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.260
they all are forming a victory with this variable.

88
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.870
That's what we're printing here.

89
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.450
That's it,

90
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.250
Right?

91
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.940
So that you can also come by and you're keyword based arguments with some variable as well

92
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.940
.

93
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.520
Let's I'm taking here some letter,

94
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.900
Pete,

95
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.680
I'm invariable P now.

96
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.250
Very first,

97
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.430
I need to pass some value.

98
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.050
Let's say 56 you can print p also here,

99
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.750
So just combination off normal argument and then cure based arguments combination.

100
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.570
Something wrong?

101
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.520
Yeah,

102
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.450
in this function,

103
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.530
786 10 7 We're not passing there,

104
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.800
right?

105
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.950
Nobody See that?

106
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.190
So we are passing for P first value remaining all our key based arguments the same.

107
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.300
They had to pass in 1/7 line and a six lane so that the value off people be assigned to be

108
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.530
I mean,

109
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.910
first value remaining.

110
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.590
All are like,

111
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.010
you know,

112
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.890
key based arguments.

113
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.620
So they will form a dictionary.

114
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.110
That's it.

115
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.580
So there is a simple way to create variable,

116
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.810
and he basically arguments for your functions.

117
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.850
Okay,

118
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.450
so there's by this we completed all the possible syntax Is all the possible ways to define

119
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.130
your functions right?

120
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.650
Next will tryto write the script by using all these concepts one by one.

121
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.720
Okay,

122
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.320
be ready with all these concepts so that we can easily understand while writing your core,

123
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.250
using difference in taxes off different types of your functions.

124
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.690
Okay.

125
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.280
Okay,

126
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.540
guys,

127
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.850
thank you for watching this with you.
