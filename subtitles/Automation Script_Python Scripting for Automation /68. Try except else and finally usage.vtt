00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
friends here.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.460
We're going to see the difference between try except finally on dry except Elsa Block

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.070
theology.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:19.680
We know simple prayer and accept on Friday except exceptional Z and also by adding known

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.550
exceptions,

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.750
right,

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.460
See,

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.950
I mean,

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.760
let me weapon my older and I'm going toe save it as a simple script.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.850
Differences.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.110
Yeah,

12
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.050
I would take this one.

13
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.760
No,

14
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.320
See that?

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.180
So already?

16
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.830
We know if I tried toe prints,

17
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.100
something called Variable Year right?

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:53.200
Simpler imprinting exception occur.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.230
So,

20
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.450
guys,

21
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.950
I'm trying to print the variable value year.

22
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.050
But if that is not different,

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.250
definitely will get an exception.

24
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.050
That's why I'm handling in this way you start getting an era.

25
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.850
It's correct.

26
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.250
But the thing is,

27
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.750
what type of exception you're getting.

28
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.910
So for that,

29
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.860
what you can do,

30
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.530
you can add exception as e Stedman.

31
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.160
And then you can print that Earl as well.

32
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.220
Yes,

33
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.050
I'm getting there.

34
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.970
But if name is not defined,

35
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.930
you know that what is the exception?

36
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.130
Your fighting is going to rice that is name error.

37
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.170
That's why I can handle known errors in this way.

38
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.650
Also before you will accept exceptionals e block,

39
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.300
you can buy it in the street like ways any any,

40
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.010
like any accepted he can handle.

41
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.450
If you know the exceptions,

42
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560
bearable is not define now.

43
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.460
Which Block is going to execute like this block is going to exclude?

44
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.470
Suppose you feei is defined them.

45
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.560
There is no exception,

46
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.230
like if he's define no exception,

47
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.840
simply are bringing available value.

48
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.150
It may be any value,

49
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.450
right,

50
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.210
that's fine.

51
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.700
But if he is no different than on your part on is going to rise an exception on if that

52
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.590
exception is there here,

53
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.550
then it will match and will exclude that except the block.

54
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.350
That's fine.

55
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.880
Likewise,

56
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.350
you can handle any number of exceptions if you know,

57
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.120
and we know we have finally as well.

58
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.510
What is the use of uses off?

59
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.050
Finally,

60
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:42.900
this will execute always.

61
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.550
I love money.

62
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.390
See,

63
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.760
as I have no yays 10 under your trying to print the available values,

64
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.110
for there is no exception.

65
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.570
So your prey block is such as if private off success,

66
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.190
you're not getting an exception.

67
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.050
That's fine,

68
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.830
but if finally,

69
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.590
is that whether you are going to exclude your tribe block successfully or not,

70
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.950
or whether you are going to rise any exception or not.

71
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.310
Finally,

72
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.500
we'll always excuse.

73
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.250
So whatever the quarter is there and finally that we'll always execute.

74
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.550
That's fine.

75
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.350
No one I'm doing is let me come in this.

76
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.580
No,

77
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.890
I'm going to write else block.

78
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.040
So I'm reading.

79
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:44.900
Simply bring this will execute if there is no If there is no exceptions in my block,

80
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.580
that's it.

81
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.220
Simple finally,

82
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.300
is always excluding.

83
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.640
But whereas if you are else block after all your exceptions in your pie block,

84
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.990
what will happen means if there is no exception.

85
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.610
If everything goes good with your tribe block,

86
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.750
then only else will also execute.

87
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.240
So hats off.

88
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.690
No,

89
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.750
everything is good.

90
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.190
I mean,

91
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.950
my block is good,

92
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.290
right?

93
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.340
You There is no chance to get any exception because he is there and you're trying to print

94
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.210
the available value.

95
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.990
Not this will excutive.

96
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.880
There is no exception.

97
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.390
Your newer pray block know what I'm doing is I'm building your very able value.

98
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.740
Now you're going to get an exception is not defined,

99
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.450
That is name it.

100
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.950
A variable is not defined.

101
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.800
So if you get any exception in your tribe block,

102
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.440
then you're else won't execute.

103
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.680
No.

104
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.350
See the results.

105
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.750
You're not getting this message else else block Mrs.

106
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.450
So simply simply.

107
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.650
If if this is success right,

108
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.950
then only else will execute.

109
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:57.350
If I if private you any suppose if any exceptional calling pray then else won't excuse.

110
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.050
Right?

111
00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.950
Fine.

112
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.490
So you know the difference else.

113
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.550
And then finally,

114
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.960
in case you can also include after else.

115
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.450
Finally,

116
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.890
also,

117
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.370
that means actually dry except any number off exception blocks and then else.

118
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.960
And finally,

119
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.050
that complete syntax if you want.

120
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.930
So finally,

121
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.750
finally and else are optional.

122
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.480
These two are optional.

123
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.920
If you want,

124
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.180
we can included right?

125
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.390
No cm runny.

126
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:32.810
What did happen bring the some exception occurred that his name error.

127
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.500
So that's why variable is no different.

128
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.180
You're printing.

129
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.190
So if exception occurred than anywhere else wanting,

130
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.450
scored so else.

131
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.820
My says you're not getting but finally are getting because finally will always to exclude

132
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.050
that.

133
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.810
Now I am defending everyday value.

134
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.950
My I'm running.

135
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.810
See,

136
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.470
that is a so there is not accepting your tribe block.

137
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.510
That's why it is successful.

138
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.450
Your price success if price access else will execute.

139
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.380
Yes,

140
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.520
you are getting anywhere.

141
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.140
Finally,

142
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.370
finally will always six school.

143
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.290
That's what it is going.

144
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:14.780
So this is the complete SIM packs for you were try except on else finally block night.

145
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.440
So guys for timing tried to remember the syntax.

146
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.380
If you write in this way,

147
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.270
what will happen?

148
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.000
But what time?

149
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.550
What what blood is going to excuse,

150
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.240
Right?

151
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.260
So once we start with the real time scenarios there,

152
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.090
I will try to you this effectively up to that.

153
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.260
I can use it for timing Fighter.

154
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.550
Remember distant taxes.

155
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.250
Okay.

156
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.980
Okay,

157
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.280
guys,

158
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.750
Thank you for watching this review.
