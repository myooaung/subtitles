1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
friends here.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,540
We're going toe work with the daytime module.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,160
See,

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,150
this daytime model is a default model with your python,

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,050
the Ford or bidding model with your python on,

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,450
which is used to work with the dates sometimes.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,150
Just imagine that you're going to create some log file every day,

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,500
and I want to create my log file with dates.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,390
I mean,

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,840
while creating my log file name.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,390
I want to include the date as well in the file name.

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,940
So here I want include a day not lug.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,620
So,

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,030
Dave,

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,480
eyes,

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,450
I want to great my log files,

18
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,220
then.

19
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:39,410
Well,

20
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,380
creating your final aim automatically.

21
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,050
Unit toe.

22
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,750
Create your filing with the bed.

23
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,480
Suppose I'm giving one of a simple example.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,110
Likewise your different usages in your real time with your daytime model.

25
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,750
Right?

26
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,650
Fine.

27
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,430
See,

28
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,100
we know that if you have any model and if you want to use that foster fall,

29
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,450
you hardly import that right.

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,840
Let me enter into my fight on Colonel.

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,350
I'm going to import a daytime module.

32
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,090
That's it.

33
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,430
No guys inside off this debt I model.

34
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,200
We hope some sub models are some operations.

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,100
Let me show you that we know how to listen the list off operations which are there with

36
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,280
your model c inside off this daytime model again you house.

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,820
Someday they time their times the a p a time time,

38
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,550
goldar time,

39
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,580
Jonah and I'm going in for I mean,

40
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,080
these are the different operations with your main daytime model on this is used to work

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,930
with the only dates and this is used to work with only time on this,

42
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,890
you can get both the operations.

43
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,350
I mean,

44
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,580
these data operations.

45
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,220
And this time,

46
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,850
operations both you can get from your daytime model.

47
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,950
Nothing.

48
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,190
Okay,

49
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,180
so in this video,

50
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,580
right,

51
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,870
I'm going to work with the daytime operation only from your main module.

52
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,750
Their time I'm going toe work with the daytime operation.

53
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,780
Right.

54
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,000
So that means See that from your date time model.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,640
This is your main model inside off that you have a operation called daytime.

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,150
Then what are the operations on that model?

57
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,820
That operation.

58
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,650
See that?

59
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,080
These all are the operations,

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,540
right?

61
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,860
Let me go with the some of them.

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,270
At least see drink their time.

63
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,900
This is your main model in that This is the operation in that If I want to see.

64
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,140
What is that date as off?

65
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,510
No,

66
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,010
they done time.

67
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,280
Like not only that,

68
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,750
you can also use this operation supposed today,

69
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,560
right?

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,660
Both are going to give same information.

71
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,980
But there is a small difference.

72
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,950
I will show you that on as off.

73
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,250
No,

74
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,810
this host is that I mean,

75
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,860
the time John for this host is I ust Indian time.

76
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,050
I said right.

77
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,450
Fine.

78
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,790
Let me weapon my UNIX terminal,

79
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,190
which has been created from a rib Lasak owned on by default.

80
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,090
You know that time,

81
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,330
Joan,

82
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,770
for this is UTC time,

83
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,380
right?

84
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

85
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,850
Let me enter into my fight on thermal and I'm going to import a model called Daytime Model

86
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,620
Here also on now you know how to print They were today's date on time.

87
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,420
So from your date time just set up your sub model daytime from that?

88
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,850
No.

89
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,540
So this is 7 25th I mean,

90
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,420
July 25th.

91
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,890
Yes,

92
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,900
even in your local host also 7 25 But time is here.

93
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,690
Our own 84 real money.

94
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,490
Yet 2 35 PM right?

95
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,650
There is a small difference.

96
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,950
That means the time John for this host is UTC so based on that you are getting your time.

97
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,480
I mean,

98
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,770
even you can use their time door today.

99
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,050
Also this today also you can use it.

100
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,820
Yes,

101
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,150
You're getting same information.

102
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,720
Fine.

103
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,200
First of all,

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,020
you have to understand that that no under today operations are going to give you the time

105
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,510
date information based on it were default time,

106
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,070
John which has been set for you.

107
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:10,910
What host like if you want to get I'm John information off any other time June.

108
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,750
I want to get supposed.

109
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,430
Yeah,

110
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,710
I know you are No UBC right as off.

111
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,930
No,

112
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,630
you are not UTC because this is a lie.

113
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,710
Next box on that I'm joined for this.

114
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,350
Is you busy?

115
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,130
But here I want to get my yesterday.

116
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,370
I mean,

117
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,590
if you want to get your yester timing right,

118
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,710
see that you can get from this operation Only this operation is get is used to get only

119
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,450
your local time.

120
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:41,270
There is no there is no any other option to get other times on information from this

121
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,840
operation.

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,550
But using this operation not know I can get any other.

123
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm John information,

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
but before going to get it,

125
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,870
What is the time,

126
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,340
June You need for that time.

127
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,690
Joan,

128
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,730
you need to create a one object so that you can create by using fight.

129
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,100
Is it module bite on time,

130
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,110
John Model as off.

131
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,240
No,

132
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,330
don't worry about this,

133
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:04,880
okay?

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,520
We'll discuss in detail about your time.

135
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,660
June information later.

136
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,570
As off now.

137
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:08,800
Yes.

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,450
I want to show you the difference between dart No andare today.

139
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,650
The white desert.

140
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:21,830
Don't let me Corbett otherwise how holiday syntax For that I want to create a yesterday

141
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,080
time,

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Joan simply from your time John Aisyah Kolkata that it was for my estate.

143
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm John object.

144
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,550
I created my object now one out of Louise.

145
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,330
If you print badly in this way without giving any arguments or any value to you are no

146
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,000
operation.

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,590
It is going to your local time,

148
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,610
which is as off No,

149
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,220
on this horse.

150
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,750
You busy?

151
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,800
But I want to get I want to get four.

152
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
I used to time,

153
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,400
June.

154
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,680
Then you can pass your time,

155
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:50,900
June.

156
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,220
But don't bury right as a string your time,

157
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,550
John.

158
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,280
You have to create some object.

159
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,640
No.

160
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,600
See that 28 mean eight PM eight minutes.

161
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Right.

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,660
See the result?

163
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,220
Vacancy on my window.

164
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,450
Also right out of I just open my terminal and see the results for is a time 88 PM That's

165
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,150
what you are getting.

166
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,570
So if you want to get any other time,

167
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:15,770
John,

168
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,760
information now is helpful.

169
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,140
Dart.

170
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,850
No operation is helpful.

171
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,750
Like Fine.

172
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,350
These are very hard to get your local time as well as any other time.

173
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,520
John.

174
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,200
Information.

175
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,420
Okay,

176
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,760
here.

177
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,150
I want to show you one more thing.

178
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,450
Type A USD.

179
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,220
See these?

180
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,030
A class court?

181
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,550
You are.

182
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,920
I am Joan information so that you don't write your string here in no operation,

183
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,250
they are to write some glass object.

184
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,150
So that already concluded from pure teacher model.

185
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,350
I get in that.

186
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,290
No,

187
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,870
nothing is there for any time,

188
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,060
Johnny.

189
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,390
Hard to just change your time John here and passed that information in your now so that you

190
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,450
are going to get from your local host any time John Information.

191
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,350
That's fine,

192
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,850
right?

193
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,660
No.

194
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,400
Let me weapon my local host so somewhat.

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,350
This is local host.

196
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,860
It may be dark today or maybe dot No,

197
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,450
no problem.

198
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,250
Night.

199
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,240
See as off?

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,450
No,

201
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,320
because of dot no or dark today what you're getting you're getting and buyer date with

202
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,450
minutes and hours.

203
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,120
Seconds.

204
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,650
Fractional seconds.

205
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,890
Right.

206
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,750
But I don't want to get all those things I want to get only what is the year from here?

207
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,350
See the result?

208
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,390
What is the month?

209
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,260
I can start this result Anderson Variable Also I What is the date?

210
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,050
I mean day.

211
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:47,250
Then what is the power then?

212
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,450
What is a minute?

213
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,150
Even seconds also,

214
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,150
You can get it right.

215
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,680
That's it.

216
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Fine.

217
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,610
But in June of getting in this way just to get your year,

218
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,180
Month day on this final object you're doing dot Operation Gold a year Monday.

219
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,370
How?

220
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,110
Or something like that.

221
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,050
But I want to get suppose year on the month.

222
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,550
Then you need to former dis reserve.

223
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,440
Right?

224
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,700
See,

225
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,850
that isn't What I'm doing is if you bring in this way,

226
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,350
you're getting your result.

227
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,670
No,

228
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,660
I'm going to former.

229
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm going to convert that into string format on based on my requirement.

230
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,050
My requirement is I want to get only here.

231
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,200
Not that I mean 19 2004 digits here.

232
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,950
I want to get only to do this year.

233
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,850
Then month.

234
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,150
Then after that,

235
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,840
what you need?

236
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,050
They not so I'm Mr One More parents is mostly the result.

237
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm going to do this in your the year if I take.

238
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,780
If I take capital,

239
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,750
why no see that result?

240
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,280
So you feel remember only dead time operation from your daytime model.

241
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,730
From this,

242
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,260
you can get either your time.

243
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,360
I mean minutes or hours or date or month.

244
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,850
Wondered where we can get anything by using string for my time.

245
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,370
You can former Ah,

246
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,650
your unit of possum.

247
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,550
You were letters based on your requirement.

248
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,430
So how you can remember all those things?

249
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:31,280
Nothing is that Let me weapon one website call string former time dot War G string,

250
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,500
former dot former time dot watch e Right.

251
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,150
This website is going to do all ur symbols.

252
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,370
I mean,

253
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,010
according what is the meaning for that?

254
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,050
You just Abdul here and you can for Marty will result.

255
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:51,450
So suppose definitely I want to get some former in this way instead of your default print.

256
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,270
What are your printing with your know what?

257
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,530
Today you're getting in this way,

258
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,050
but I want to format.

259
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:05,250
That's a I wanted for murder in this way.

260
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll see that is a mighty of what it is Giving some former so for each and every letter.

261
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,290
The reason.

262
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,850
Meaning you just go to this letter on after the output,

263
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,190
right?

264
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,100
You need to remember this.

265
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,460
Just remember this website whenever If you want to write some by tons,

266
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,150
could be using their time model undefended.

267
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,320
But if you want to format your date time,

268
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
then come back to your string.

269
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,780
Former time dot org on Abdoulaye were courts and its meanings.

270
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,420
So after doing some practice definitely will remember at least some characters.

271
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,550
I'm in some courts.

272
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,050
Right?

273
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,250
Fine.

274
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,750
Then I want to discuss one more thing here.

275
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,820
That is very,

276
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,390
very important.

277
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:44,590
One.

278
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,400
Let me do that.

279
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,650
So from your daytime dot their time,

280
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,600
if you see the results,

281
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,350
you're having different operations,

282
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,640
right?

283
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,300
Just know we discuss about right today now and then.

284
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,370
Some string former something like that.

285
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,300
Where is it?

286
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,490
Yes,

287
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,770
String.

288
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,650
Former time,

289
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,270
right?

290
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,550
No,

291
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,220
I want I'm going to work with one more thing called from times time.

292
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,660
What is that?

293
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,030
See,

294
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:21,140
that isn't if I try to bring a date time dot bit time dot from I'm Stam.

295
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:27,030
So this operation is going to take the seconds number off seconds.

296
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,690
If you provide number of seconds automatically,

297
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,540
it will convert into your date.

298
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,550
Let's say I'm going to provide.

299
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,830
Maybe that is not sufficient to create your debts.

300
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,050
Let me right.

301
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:48,450
Or maybe spell Mr From.

302
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,280
I am stumble spelling mistakes,

303
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,750
not see the reason in real argument.

304
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:01,830
Yes,

305
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:08,580
he So this is maybe more than Mag Zoom are limit off your date.

306
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,200
I mean,

307
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,860
if you see here some very harm Anyone?

308
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,360
My exam.

309
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,570
Right.

310
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,090
So Mag zoomed.

311
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:22,160
It is able to provide up to late time dot Sorry,

312
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,910
Max.

313
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,460
So my except a triple line.

314
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,710
44 nines.

315
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,590
So maybe this seconds are more than that.

316
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,250
That's what it is not able to convert.

317
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,750
That's it.

318
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,270
So this one is very,

319
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,850
very important.

320
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,330
We will use it in the real time as well.

321
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,040
Okay,

322
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,430
so that's as off.

323
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:38,720
No,

324
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,020
I'm giving only this symbol operations.

325
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,610
Right.

326
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,850
Well,

327
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,860
going forward,

328
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,740
we will see some more operations,

329
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,350
right?

330
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,870
I just try to remember these things.

331
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,640
So what we discussed we imported their time model.

332
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,890
So in their time,

333
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,500
what will be hard,

334
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,650
different operations,

335
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,770
different sub models,

336
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,440
like date time,

337
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,650
and then their time.

338
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,060
So if you go with the date you can work with.

339
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,580
Only date.

340
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,370
If you go with time,

341
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,430
we're gonna work with only time.

342
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,550
But if you go with the daytime,

343
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,150
you can work with either date or time or both at the time.

344
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,950
That's what I'm going to work with the daytime,

345
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,820
right?

346
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:20,690
Then someone we're printing in this very their time dot daytime not know,

347
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,570
right by 84.

348
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,130
And I was going to give a local our time.

349
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,390
John,

350
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,350
whatever the time during you said for your host,

351
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,000
that time doing it is going to provide.

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,310
But if you want to work with any other time,

353
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,620
Joan,

354
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,390
what you gotta do is your toe import some model call fight on time,

355
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,740
John,

356
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,850
and then created were required.

357
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,450
I'm John object.

358
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,560
Quite time Johnny course to simply You were P weight.

359
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,110
Is it in that you had to provide time,

360
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,470
John?

361
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,390
They inside this yard to write your time,

362
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:53,640
John.

363
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,560
Name on.

364
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:54,750
Then.

365
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,090
If you take this on,

366
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,560
if you provide that variable here now,

367
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,450
it is going to you that time based Don't even require time,

368
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:01,750
John.

369
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,210
Right?

370
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,950
And one more thing this Beware they these people.

371
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,090
Tizard is not a default model in it.

372
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,650
Imported into to install it on imported.

373
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,410
Okay,

374
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,370
we'll work aboard.

375
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:12,860
Ah,

376
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,930
how to use be weight.

377
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:20,660
Age it later I find so after that the final thing you have to remember that how to convert

378
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,900
you are date time,

379
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,110
final or port in tow.

380
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,350
String format.

381
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,610
Right In this way,

382
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,650
here you are probably required courts.

383
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:41,960
And just to remember that there is a website called s T R f time dot org Night on one more

384
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,270
point.

385
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,640
Ease.

386
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:42,920
See,

387
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,520
guys from your date time your important You are using their time one second night.

388
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,570
I don't want right two times this date time.

389
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,290
Then what you do,

390
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:57,850
What you will do is we can do in this way from their time import bit time.

391
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,290
Now you don't write this part because directly from this you are importing this into your

392
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,750
script.

393
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:11,630
Now I can do simply bring their time dot No Likewise All operations,

394
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:21,410
let me show you on my common line from day I am import they time no directly.

395
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm reading their time.

396
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,950
Don't know that's it.

397
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,290
Okay,

398
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,530
this is just shortcut enough using lenti daytime dot daytime from their time that it'll

399
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,400
imported time.

400
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,680
Now you are importing the operation directly from your daytime model.

401
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
What is your operation?

402
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,140
If this is your date time,

403
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,060
you're inside off that.

404
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,610
Your operation?

405
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,370
Is this wonderful?

406
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm importing this one.

407
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,570
No,

408
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,950
I can use deadly this one in this way.

409
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,750
Not okay.

410
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,860
Okay.

411
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,270
Thank you for watching this video.

412
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,770
We'll see some more concepts while going forward.

413
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,550
Okay.

414
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,650
Look at I
