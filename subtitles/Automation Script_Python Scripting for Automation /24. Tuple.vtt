00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Prince in this video,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.280
we're going to discuss about the next two data structure.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.750
That is double data structure night.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.110
See,

5
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.360
let me show you how to work with couple.

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.700
I mean,

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.850
how to define on order.

8
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.720
Access your values off your trouble,

9
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.260
right?

10
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.850
How to do some operations on your top religious structure?

11
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.000
First thing let me define.

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So how did they find you were Couple,

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.020
right?

14
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.610
So you guys you can define define your topple,

15
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.060
You know,

16
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.310
like my topple my couple Any any variable then you can take.

17
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.650
But I'm doing simply my tipple.

18
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.880
Three common for Come on fight.

19
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.450
And if you want to define any empty topple right,

20
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.050
my empty couple equals So this it right?

21
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.950
No.

22
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.050
Let me sell this as a some by transcript on I want to run something here.

23
00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.510
So working with a couple.

24
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.310
Fine.

25
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.170
So first thing how you can print They were a couple.

26
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.650
Simply the wearable name.

27
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.370
See,

28
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.510
that would put or how you can print your empty trouble,

29
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570
But I wouldn't a variable you have for that.

30
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.250
That's it.

31
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.170
No.

32
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.540
See that right now?

33
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.070
Let me come.

34
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.240
What?

35
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.420
They were toppled into bullion.

36
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
So first I'm going to convert my empty topple into bullion.

37
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.390
You know the empty list.

38
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.450
If you convert into double what you're going to get the bullion data as false savior here

39
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.090
I'm converting my entry topple into bullion.

40
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.350
Now you're getting false.

41
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.430
Let me convert some non empty topple Indo 1,000,000,000 Not empty.

42
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.070
Nothing morality.

43
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.050
How you're double right.

44
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.560
See,

45
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.660
that would put true right?

46
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.420
So if you can what any empty topple data into a 1,000,000,000 you'll get a false or if you

47
00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.700
cannot,

48
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.650
any non empty trouble later in two billion you'll get always true,

49
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.370
right?

50
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.240
Fine.

51
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:15.180
The next thing is so I want to define it couple So they're my double consist off different

52
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.590
values on in there.

53
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.360
One of the value easy list.

54
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.710
Yes,

55
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.050
you can.

56
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.000
I mean,

57
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.360
suppose sometimes if you vision requirement,

58
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.110
you can also defend your couple in this way.

59
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.970
Let's say 34 injured or fight the 5th 3rd element I'm taking as a list.

60
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.700
Nobody can take it right now.

61
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.560
Let me define Let me print mine minute operator sit output body are getting No,

62
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.620
there's you know how to access your elements from your list.

63
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.790
Based on index,

64
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.710
the same concept is applicable.

65
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.950
Even while working with your couple,

66
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.130
you can access particular value from your papa.

67
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.150
Let's say I want access number four.

68
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.940
Do you know if you go with the pause to index,

69
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.810
the number four Knicks is one right,

70
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.920
Because 30 than forties one,

71
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.700
then this entire thing is one element.

72
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.150
Guests.

73
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.050
This entire thing is a one element for your main couple.

74
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.510
So that's right for this entire list Indexes to now.

75
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.250
This is three.

76
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.050
And this is for right now.

77
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.250
Let me bring something,

78
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.550
friend.

79
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.910
You are a couple with indexes,

80
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.350
Jiro.

81
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.720
See that?

82
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780
Put where you're getting your getting first value.

83
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.350
Let me bring a couple value on index one.

84
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.150
Not see that would put what you're getting.

85
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.730
Let me print the index value to from your tipple.

86
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.400
That is a list off value.

87
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.160
So that would put all you're getting 567 Now from this,

88
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.850
if you want to get right suppose six.

89
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.350
The number six I need to get.

90
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.030
So if you want to get to six faster than you are to get this element,

91
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.000
that is a list.

92
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.260
Yes,

93
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.840
we are getting that with help off in next to now from this from this unit six value.

94
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.500
That means I get to take in next one.

95
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.060
Now,

96
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.400
see that Would what you're going to get?

97
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.050
Six.

98
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.650
So be clear,

99
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.940
guys,

100
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.890
if you want to access digit six first of all from your main couple,

101
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.240
this is your main temple From that couple forced you are to get this element to get that

102
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.090
element we're taking in textiles to because positive index 012 No,

103
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.740
this is like a one list like from this list.

104
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.170
If you want to get second element harder,

105
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.040
take index as one.

106
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.460
That's what I did find.

107
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.060
No,

108
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.950
let's be our sign from my couple index of zero value Something is that I want to modify

109
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.060
that with some other value.

110
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.270
Let's say in this way after that,

111
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.460
whether it is possible or not,

112
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.500
you are getting an ETA couple Object does not support item assignment.

113
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.580
That means once,

114
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.990
if you're defined the values in your topple,

115
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.200
you cannot change the any values or item in your couple.

116
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.410
That means couples are immutable assignment.

117
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.050
Modifying the part off your trouble is not possible,

118
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.400
but modifying the antidote is more is possible,

119
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.950
like your strings also right even in your strings,

120
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.390
you can modify and testing,

121
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.810
but you cannot modify the part off your string.

122
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.100
Same rule is applicable with your apple as well.

123
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.820
They so it's very,

124
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.410
very important.

125
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.070
Race couple on strings for immutable.

126
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.390
That means once if you defined,

127
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.850
you cannot change the part off your couple or strength.

128
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.980
That's a No couple is not ableto do.

129
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.970
I mean you can't perform any operations such that what the old are prison you're using

130
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.250
right?

131
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.250
That operation is not going to modify your trouble.

132
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.400
That's why you're saying topples are immutable.

133
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.400
That's why you see the operations on your topple.

134
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.250
There are no much operations on your double.

135
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.770
Let's say I'm defining Couple called for Come off I and see the operations on your couple

136
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.580
Only counter next operations you don't know,

137
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.420
like up and insert update.

138
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.770
I mean,

139
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.150
ah,

140
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.750
stop removed.

141
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.950
Extent.

142
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.750
Those all are there with your list,

143
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.090
right?

144
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.650
Let's say I have a list off data so on that I'm trying to find the list off operations.

145
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.900
See that you how index extend.

146
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.450
So it next anybody is there with you and never couple also right index and count.

147
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.050
Other than that you don't have any operations like remove sort,

148
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.050
right?

149
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.930
Insert X turn.

150
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.650
Copy.

151
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.590
So that means once if you define it up,

152
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.640
will you cannot modify it.

153
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.830
Right now you know how to use over the counter in index.

154
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.850
What is the purpose of conch if you have a double like this,

155
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.350
something like this.

156
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.110
So how many times?

157
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.210
But clearly letter is the butler number?

158
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.430
Is there butler data?

159
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.700
Is there any given couple?

160
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.120
Let's say I want to find five.

161
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.190
How many times it is death,

162
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.580
Right?

163
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.150
Let's a different one more fine now and check it two times.

164
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.900
Then what is the index off number five?

165
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.850
Digital.

166
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.950
So is there any number?

167
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.490
Ah,

168
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.890
fight after index.

169
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.540
One side after next zero.

170
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.500
Because very forced you next is number fighter.

171
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.640
I don't want to look for this other than that from here.

172
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.210
I want to look.

173
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.280
Is there any fight then?

174
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.650
Probably that starting index from where you want to look?

175
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.010
Yes,

176
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.560
it is there somewhere in 50 operation and you can find the length off your couple guys.

177
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.050
See that six letter so that I mean six date us are there in your temple,

178
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.300
So length is applicable your strings list a couple.

179
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.800
All right,

180
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.210
let me insure you once again.

181
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.760
If it is a list,

182
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.110
then length off your study for it is a string,

183
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.550
then lent off your string.

184
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.250
Let's define some list,

185
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.110
then lent off your list.

186
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.510
Let's different.

187
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.240
Some couple.

188
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.720
Then what is the length off your couple?

189
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.450
That's it.

190
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.550
Okay,

191
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.890
so there's you can access based on index,

192
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.910
your couple values as your list,

193
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.080
right?

194
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.750
I mean,

195
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.680
already we've done this thing.

196
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:19.880
No,

197
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.330
let me our do it.

198
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.150
One second.

199
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.580
Come here.

200
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.070
Let me define my couple in this way.

201
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:39.550
Any couple mobile right now you know what is the use off couple?

202
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.180
Colon?

203
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.450
Same operation as you were list on the spring.

204
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.560
You're going to get entire couple,

205
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.450
but I want to get from Index Jiro the last same thing,

206
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.510
but I want to get from index card index to last 30.

207
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.950
Index means Joe Indexes three number.

208
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:09.270
This is second index on This is that's such a regional of 12 3 60 is the card index from

209
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.350
six to last I want.

210
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.750
Then I can take in this way,

211
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.850
right?

212
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.540
So whatever the index operations we perform Lonely World strings.

213
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.050
All are applicable here as well.

214
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:27.540
Let's say I want to get from starting to 15 next value.

215
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.120
If you want to get 50 next value,

216
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.930
you are to provide six.

217
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:30.160
Right.

218
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.800
See that one first?

219
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.700
Jiro.

220
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:44.390
123456 If you take 16 dates,

221
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.200
you're getting upto $5 6 Well,

222
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.990
it's up to 15.

223
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.220
Next,

224
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.450
right,

225
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.990
that's it.

226
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.870
Now let me take one more thing.

227
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.300
A last operation one second.

228
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:09.360
So that is simply print my tipple from third index three values from 13 Next three values,

229
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.500
then three plus 36 yard to provide are from 13.

230
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:12.710
Next,

231
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.980
I want to get to Alice.

232
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.350
Only three and four,

233
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.990
three and four.

234
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.660
That's why three place to fifth Now.

235
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.930
If you observe the airport,

236
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.790
you're getting two values as a couple.

237
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:29.750
Now we have lost explanation with your couple.

238
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.750
That is,

239
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.930
I suppose if I did X equals to fight,

240
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.480
then print exe under then Taipa fix.

241
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.000
You don't put in diesel,

242
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.250
right?

243
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.020
But I am giving comma here.

244
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.800
No seat output a couple.

245
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.910
So if you write X equals toe fight comma,

246
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:57.940
that is a A couple which consist off only one value And also you can do something like this

247
00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.900
is also valid.

248
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.350
Couple A fighter might come on nine minutes.

249
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.950
A couple Which contest off?

250
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.180
Three values.

251
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:04.850
Sit output.

252
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.650
You're not getting any better.

253
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.060
If you write in this way by default,

254
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.550
it will become a couple data structure.

255
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.750
You need to remember this point.

256
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.820
Okay,

257
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.720
single later.

258
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.380
Police.

259
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.350
You can buy something in this some number.

260
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.550
But if you don't write comma,

261
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.710
it will become an Indian.

262
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.980
Data in deserve variable.

263
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.350
But it is not a double data structure wearable.

264
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.360
If Wright comma,

265
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.710
that will become a couple data structure variable.

266
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.650
All right,

267
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.550
you guys,

268
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.110
these are the important points with you.

269
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.770
Are double guys as off?

270
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.120
No.

271
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.460
We have seen a list of data structure and double data structure.

272
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.980
So you don't remember that lists or mutable.

273
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.410
But now what?

274
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.030
If you want to change the data off your list,

275
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.670
any part off your list,

276
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.420
you can change it.

277
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.750
But you cannot change the part off your couple.

278
00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:02.050
That's why string lists are immutable and troubles are immutable.

279
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.250
Okay,

280
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.100
then what is?

281
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.650
The use is off your topple and list in your real life.

282
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.180
See,

283
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.180
you're designing some by phone script night on.

284
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.450
You're taking some data.

285
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.580
So we're taking data by logic.

286
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.250
If you want to change your data,

287
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:28.390
you have to take your data as at least even by mistake.

288
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:34.370
If you don't want to change your data than simply consider your data as a couple and we

289
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.760
will see that situation with help off an example once if we complete with the word basic

290
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.450
concepts.

291
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.390
So after that,

292
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.120
he had to wait.

293
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.740
So after that,

294
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.850
you have to remember simply.

295
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.690
Couple immutable lists are mutable.

296
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.250
That's it.

297
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.150
Okay.

298
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.360
Okay.

299
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.800
Thank you for watching this with you.
