ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
preference here.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:11.070
We're going to see how to install python only word limits or any UNIX like systems for

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.380
installing required.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.850
Fight on on Lennox.

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.460
See why I am saying installing required fight on online X.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.950
Because if you go with anyone of the UNIX like systems,

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.320
most of the UNIX like systems are already configured with any one of the pipe on Washington

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.320
.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.850
Based on the release off your line external.

10
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.760
Right now,

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.930
let me weapon might ways.

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.890
So this is Lennox.

13
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.350
Or more specifically,

14
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.990
it is.

15
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.150
I'm Agent Lennox.

16
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.230
Okay?

17
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.640
And it is released in total tonight.

18
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.320
In much no,

19
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.150
if I run simply said,

20
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.550
fight on Haifa Knife on Russian,

21
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.440
You're getting some fight on two awards honored 16 means these their default washing for

22
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.950
this Lennox.

23
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.050
And you can also how you are big portion as well.

24
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.620
I mean,

25
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.560
people is also configured so binding for most of the UNIX like systems are configured with

26
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.570
your python on.

27
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.800
You may get that washing.

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.040
Maybe to start off.

29
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.000
I oughta write seven out around six.

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.950
Whatever it may be based on when it was released.

31
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.820
I mean,

32
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.790
your Lennox when it was released on,

33
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.750
but here I need some treated explosion.

34
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.080
Suppose,

35
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.650
let's say $3 7 Giorgio I need on this host on your Lennox.

36
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.970
So,

37
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.350
guys,

38
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.300
first of all before going to install your required python Washington on you are any UNIX

39
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.890
like systems Don't disturb existing python because you are a young command really depends

40
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.960
on your python or some operated some operations on your UNIX like systems really depends on

41
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.600
your python.

42
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.010
That's why don't be stopped The existing fight on Washington I mean my nobody for going to

43
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.050
install any new python Don't take name as fight on nature of that fight on,

44
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.750
let's say fight on expert on why something like that or bite on three in that we just take

45
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.310
the name for your fight on software,

46
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.260
Right?

47
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.160
So in the very heart install first let me and then into route because I have toe install

48
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.980
this Pitre So I should be the root user are you can also run from any user for that You

49
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.250
should have some group villages so injured off all confusions First I entered into route No

50
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.250
,

51
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.020
I am the root user right now you have some steps against very simple steps.

52
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.550
Let me go with very first step.

53
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.150
See?

54
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.590
Let me open your official website.

55
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.250
Fight on dot org.

56
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.050
No.

57
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.380
So,

58
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.640
you know,

59
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.270
biting for you.

60
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.340
How some don't or tap Then there you can see view fully.

61
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.410
Stuff don't loads.

62
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.250
And here you can select your required operating system.

63
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640
I'm going to work with UNIX like systems.

64
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.360
Then simply.

65
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.250
I'm clicking on Lennox whore UNIX No CEO latest religious.

66
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.540
But I need support 3.7 or Jiro,

67
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.070
let me go and see somewhere my $3 sound original here.

68
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.150
I'm having my $3 Ono Jiro.

69
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.820
All right,

70
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.400
so let me don't know your source a tar ball.

71
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.890
So to download that on your next,

72
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.200
like systems from command line off your UNIX like systems you condone lure.

73
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.120
So for that,

74
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.850
just don't copy the link location off your required fight on software.

75
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.950
I cooperated the link location.

76
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.610
Now go to here on first check whether w get command is there or not?

77
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.460
If it is not death,

78
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.760
just simply run.

79
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.270
So,

80
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.650
um,

81
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.320
install.

82
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.660
Lovely.

83
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.520
Get I already there.

84
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.820
That's right.

85
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.410
It's not It is not installing.

86
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.920
Then let me under it Any location.

87
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.860
So I'm wondering,

88
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.510
to root or pretty So there I am Goingto don't Lord my Why don't software bite on tar source

89
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.510
?

90
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.850
Well,

91
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.650
like under that?

92
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.930
No.

93
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.330
See that?

94
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.760
Just know you don't order.

95
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.670
You're required.

96
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.250
Fight on package.

97
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.570
No,

98
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.750
you are extracted.

99
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.990
Right?

100
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.140
So to extract that,

101
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.650
simply use thought I fund explains that F so here we forward both.

102
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.750
You can see the information while extracting.

103
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.400
That's it.

104
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.650
Right now you help.

105
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.710
You would expect her prankish.

106
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.360
No,

107
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.950
you can go and install your python.

108
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.920
But before going to install your fight on right?

109
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.190
Actually,

110
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.200
this is a source file,

111
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.760
you know,

112
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.470
to compile.

113
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.010
To compile that you need some compiler on some packages as well.

114
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.350
I mean,

115
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.620
some dependencies unit.

116
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.400
You need to install your python on your host.

117
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.650
So I hold the stuff dependencies,

118
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.650
right.

119
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.550
Just before going to install your bite on Just run this command.

120
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.050
I mean,

121
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.510
I will give this comment on the blow off this video just to go through that Yum.

122
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.710
Install your dizzy.

123
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.990
See?

124
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:10.440
Openness is a level like all those things will be installed once If you install all these

125
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.840
dependence Is all these packages,

126
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.350
right?

127
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.510
No,

128
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.820
just not getting your extractor directory or extractor fight on package on there.

129
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.090
If you observe,

130
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.950
you have some conficker No run darts Last conficker command first.

131
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:36.310
So here days basically your doors last conficker you are going to provide to take your

132
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.380
conflagration details.

133
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.010
Along with that,

134
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.540
we can also provide the part where you want to install your python with this option Hyphen

135
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.390
iPhone prefix Then support.

136
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.580
I want to install somewhere User some been location.

137
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.740
Yes,

138
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:58.610
you can Probably your pop are if you skip this value hyphen iPhone prefix value by default

139
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:06.710
You're conficker Really install right you are pythons back age Require python under user

140
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.660
local bin In this location by default,

141
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.330
it'll install.

142
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.220
So I want to install in that location only.

143
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.400
That's why I'm not giving any prefix right?

144
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.180
And you can also do some hyphen.

145
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.250
IPhone enable off the mediations,

146
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.090
right?

147
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.070
If you provide this option will take some time so you can take it by providing hyphen

148
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.170
iPhone enable opt imaginations.

149
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.250
But I'm not giving that because it will take some time.

150
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.950
Right?

151
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.410
You can just try are you can also try simply darts.

152
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.650
Last conficker just enter.

153
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.250
So we take some time.

154
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:48.360
Configure your details on your holes so offered configuration Simply hard to come by your

155
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.830
core.

156
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.290
I mean,

157
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.240
you are whatever that back is,

158
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.420
you don't write that you are to come by.

159
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.950
So for that you need to run a common called make so that you are going to compile your core

160
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.950
,

161
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.150
right?

162
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.170
Yes.

163
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.510
Done.

164
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.810
No.

165
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.460
Let me run,

166
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.850
Make.

167
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.810
And before that other that it is also giving a station called please run dot,

168
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.190
slash conflict iPhone,

169
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.750
iPhone enable up the magicians,

170
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.310
right to give this information.

171
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.270
But anyway,

172
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.550
I'm not running that you can try it.

173
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.810
I now after conflagration just run,

174
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.320
make.

175
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.370
So make is nothing.

176
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.510
But you're going to compile your don't order,

177
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.630
You're ah fight on source score once.

178
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.490
If we compile,

179
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.510
then you can install right?

180
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.720
So now I'm compiling.

181
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.070
So it will take some time again.

182
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.450
You just wait for some time.

183
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.670
So once it is done,

184
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.750
they will go on install.

185
00:07:35.750 --> 00:08:06.550

And this is your people And see that the name is piped on 3.7 It is not like fight on

221
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.090
because on your UNIX like systems by default,

222
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.930
your UNIX like systems depends on anyone of the fight in Washington On it is there by

223
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.290
default with your operating system.

224
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.260
Now you've seen so many other bite on washings,

225
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.630

we are installing by country on my host holiday.

230
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.970
I hope I don't do that's why by default Python is giving some name.

231
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:18.860
Fight on three or seven right now you can very for your fight on 3.7.

232

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.390
hyphen Abortion.

235
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.780

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:39.010
So you have now you're fight on washing here some $3.7 dollars zero Nice.

237
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:43.550
If you observe previously whenever If you run or fight own command wash in.

238
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:49.980
We are running in this way But here I'm using Dark slash If I don't use darts last See that

239
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:49.980
?

240
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:57.390
How you're going to get by dawn $3.7 space hyphen iPhone wash in not come out from this

241
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:03.950
location on check it Fight on 3.7 space hyphen iPhone wash in another The output,

242
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.280
right.

See your user.

249
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.960
Local bin is already there in the old system parts.

250
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.850
That's why your python trade or seven is also ableto identified by your operating system.

251
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.440
No,

252
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.170

So where we are,

261
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.090
let me enter into that location.

262
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.690
Know what I'm doing is I'm creating a softly in court.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.270
No.

270
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:04.970
One more thing.

271
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:13.440
You hope he had people three for pipe country to manage your packages or models with your

274
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.290
But I don't want to use in this way.

275
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.740
I mean,

276
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.640
people that are seven I want to use,

like three,

278
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.490
But anyone don't create like people because already people is there with fight on two.

279
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.250
That's why I'm creating three.

280
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.200
Right?

281
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.390
Let me create again.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.720
Softening for this Ellen iPhone is 3.7.

283
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.150

not come out from here.

286
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:55.350
Our exit from there to root on from anywhere you can run now you are fight on command in

287
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.950
this way.

288
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.980
Fight on only bite on.

Right.

297
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.050
Okay.

298
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.440
So,

299
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:21.810
guys,

300
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.590
what are the steps with,

301
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.190
um as off?

302
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.510
No,

303
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.020
right.

304
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.600
All those are these things.

305
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.270
So I will provide all these steps on the Beloff.

306
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.280
This really just to go through that and you can buy seeing them.

307
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.150
You can install your fight on require bite on washing only what UNIX like systems.

308
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:45.210
So case you know something like open dough in that distribution already you have some fight

309
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.080
on 3.6.

310
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.860
Something like that.

311
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.350
If you want to use that also,

312
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.960
you can use it.

313
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.550
No problem.

314
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.050
Okay.

315
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.380
What are?

316
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.150
Maybe we need some fight on three logics.

317
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.450
But here we installed fight on 3.7.

318
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:55.950
Nor Jiro,

319
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.200
Right,

320
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.550
Because we're going to work with bite on radar techs on especially.

321
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.610
I'm using python three dot sound or Jiro.

322
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.150
That's why I installed this.

323
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.250
Okay.

324
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.280
