1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
friends here we're going to discuss aboard fight on operators.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,350
So the concepts or like you know,

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,670
what is an operator on What are the different and types off operators presenting your fight

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,490
conscripting night?

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,910
Let me start there.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,760
See?

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,250
Basically open it to sort the pillars for any language not only or fight on.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,350
Okay,

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,350
For any language,

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,550
operators are the pillars.

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,260
So without operators,

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,650
you cannot write effective logic violating your court,

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,070
right?

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,750
Fine.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,250
Then what is them operative?

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,850
So the operative can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,350
between two operations.

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,120
Let me take simply to variable Scarl execution to and why Cost of three.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,140
Now I need to find out the addition off these two variables than I'm going to take some

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,170
other variable reserve because two X plus y no Here,

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:15,080
simply place is your operator and you're performing this addition on your to variable

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,350
school x and y.

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:16,980
Now,

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,190
in this expression,

25
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:26,150
if places the operator than X and we are called operates right off course equally is also

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,530
not the opera in what we are doing with the help off equal means.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,270
Whatever the result,

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,010
you are getting that result we are assigning toe this variable.

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,000
So here are decent is the action here Assignment is the action,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,250
right?

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,950
So simply guys,

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,260
operator is just simply or symbol like plus miners modification.

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,470
We have some different symbols as well can we will see them And there is an action with

34
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:51,860
respect.

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,290
We were each and every symbol so as off No,

36
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,900
we're using place place.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,750
We know it is used to add values,

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,490
not those two values.

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,670
Maybe variables are sometimes you directly.

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,960
You can stop shoot your values Let's say three place to also I can do it or I can store

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Xing to some variable called exit Coast toe three and I can perform X Plus two our Aiken

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,570
store even to also into some variable.

43
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,460
Then I confined X plus y right now,

44
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,390
if you have your your operator,

45
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,770
this is your operator as off No,

46
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,280
you are.

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,750
I mean,

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,900
in this expression,

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,650
you're directly performing your operation on two values.

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,460
But here one is variable on one is value.

51
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,790
But here but our values that means way performing your operation with help off your

52
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,550
operator,

53
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,450
right?

54
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,590
All parents,

55
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,050
maybe values or maybe variables or combination off your violence on variables.

56
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,760
Right?

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,180
So,

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,160
by for simple example,

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
you can take place.

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,250
Is an operator to perform addition Operation on your our parents,

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,490
right?

62
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,150
Fine.

63
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,820
No fight on provides a very D off operators like,

64
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,200
you know,

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,730
automatic operators,

66
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,290
assignment operators.

67
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,550
Combat is an operator's identity operators,

68
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,520
membership operators and then logical operators.

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,170
And finally we hold with boys operators.

70
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,250
So these are these seven operators in your bite on scripting language.

71
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,450
So before going to write your logics,

72
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,300
first of all,

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,140
you should be very,

74
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,850
very good with your operators,

75
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:44,820
right on one more thing days before going to start each and every operators right here.

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,050
I'm goingto do one idea.

77
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,460
If you are able to remember that as off No,

78
00:03:50,460 --> 00:04:00,160
you can remember that that is like si foster to operators like art omitted cooperators and

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
assignment operators.

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,750
For these two,

81
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,200
you are going to provide input as a value and whatever the operators are there in ur

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,070
automatic an assignment,

83
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,650
they will do their action on your input.

84
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,520
They will provide out,

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,600
but also as a value right then coming toe next.

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,760
Three operators like combat is an identity membership operators,

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,790
so here we are going to provide input as a value.

88
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:39,260
But these operators will perform some action on your inputs and they will provide all put

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,950
as either pro are false.

90
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,170
You guys,

91
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,610
For your 1st 2 operators,

92
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,220
you are providing input as a value and you're getting old.

93
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,950
Put also value.

94
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,190
But for next three operators,

95
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,720
you're providing input as your values and open you're going to get either true or false

96
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,230
means you're getting Boolean values right then coming to logical operators for these laws

97
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,000
Collaborators.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,770
You're providing input as true or false on also,

99
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,850
or put your getting either true or false.

100
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:19,550
Then the last one is big boys operators seeing between operators.

101
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:26,510
You are going to provide input as a value and also you're getting output also value I mean

102
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,340
both inputs and outputs our values,

103
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,850
but wave performing the operation.

104
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:39,650
When you're given values by your ba twice your data will be converted in do bits or binary

105
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,930
on Under Binali data,

106
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,350
logical operations will be performed.

107
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,050
Then finally are going to get your result as a value,

108
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,580
right?

109
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,010
So,

110
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,200
guys,

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,060
for time being,

112
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,390
if you are able to remember,

113
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,350
just remember this structure so that it will be helpful while working with your operators.

114
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,050
Right.

115
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,850
So simply remember that first inputs need faster to operators.

116
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,660
Input is a value on our portal.

117
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,710
See a value then for next three operators,

118
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,960
input is some value.

119
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,920
But our put your also getting some value.

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,560
But that is purely a bullion data that is true or false than for logical operators.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,950
Input is bullion or put it also 1,000,000,000 data No for last one between the operators

122
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,490
important or put both our values but way performing the operation by your ba twice

123
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,870
operators on your given values right so directly they don't do what it will do is your data

124
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,420
will be converted as a binary.

125
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,780
Another binary.

126
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,710
The logical operation will be performed on your inputs.

127
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,470
Okay,

128
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,660
so this will be helpful if you are able to remember you just try to remember this Okay,

129
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,150
is thank you for watching this video
