1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,650
friends here.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,140
We're going to discuss about some of these special characters off.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,550
Fight on.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,160
Right to explain this,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,690
right.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,950
I'm going to take one simple bite on program or pie Transcript.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,750
Let me open my terminal first.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,130
Okay,

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,460
I'm moving in tow.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,570
Desktop there.

11
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,850
Actually have it that it recalled Python scripts.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,880
So here I am going to read this fight on script name called Special Characters.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,650
Not the way.

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,130
First,

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,070
I'm going to read one simple python program.

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,350
The purpose of that fight on program is simply toe print.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,480
Are some information like,

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,600
welcome to buy conscripting.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,030
Right.

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,250
I'm going to write that one.

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,180
Let me write it.

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,420
Bring well,

23
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,250
come toe bite on scripting.

24
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,450
So what you're doing is you are simply printing some string.

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,570
Okay,

26
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,210
so where nobody if you want to print the string using printed statement,

27
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,150
you hard to right?

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,080
You were string inside off quotation with your print night.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,500
That's okay.

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,870
First,

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,850
let me save it.

32
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,450
And runny already.

33
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,010
We know how to run your python scripts like So this is your fight landscape.

34
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,850
I'm going to run our Bytom scrape in this way.

35
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,500
Yes.

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,650
You are getting somewhat put.

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,550
There's no I want to print output like,

38
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,050
um,

39
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,500
welcome to buy conscripting.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm in the next lane I want to write.

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,880
This is about special characters off your python.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,330
So what?

43
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,000
I have to go.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,130
I need to include one more line called right.

45
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,590
Let me write it one more lane.

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,140
So I want to print one more lame.

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,850
So I had to use one more prince statement.

48
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:09,140
So we are working with some special catic.

49
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,850
This That's it.

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,650
Let me say this on our planet before running,

51
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,930
just to see what is your core.

52
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,180
So this is your core.

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,350
You're having two lines off fight on script.

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,750
So those two lines are simply to bring some strings.

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,370
So whenever if you have a print simply,

56
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,920
it will print whatever they're inside off your quotations as off.

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,150
No.

58
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,650
Let me Donny.

60
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,470
Yes,

61
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,850
I'm going two lines off information.

62
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,750
So there's actually you are using immediately to print statements,

63
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,620
first line,

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,250
print second and print your printing information with the to print statements inter off

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,050
that I can use only one print statement.

66
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,510
I can also print this line.

67
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,240
I'm in this information by what I will do is so you know how to come in.

68
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,290
Bite on escaped lines You can skip.

69
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,430
You can come in any line.

70
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,700
No,

71
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,420
I don't want to run these two lines.

72
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,550
That's why I'm commenting.

73
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,450
Now I'm going to write one single prince set man in this way.

74
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,250
When it comes to fight on scripting,

75
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,550
then I'm writing.

76
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,290
We are working with Special CASS.

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,210
Yes,

78
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,770
this will also work.

79
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,850
And you will get your output.

80
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,820
Right?

81
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,250
So before getting output,

82
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,070
just observe.

83
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,130
You are skipped once.

84
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,950
Let me clear.

85
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,590
Ever screen.

86
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:35,950
Yeah,

87
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,510
this is your script output you're getting.

88
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:46,290
But my intention is I want to print this information in one line on this information next

89
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:46,860
line here,

90
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,310
actually reading board information,

91
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,000
the single line.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,550
So at that time,

93
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,330
what I can do is weapon.

94
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,620
He was kept once from which information you want to print.

95
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
That information.

96
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,600
The next line just before that right slash n and save it,

97
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,250
right?

98
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,550
No,

99
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,650
this is your script.

100
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,150
We have only one.

101
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,010
Language is faster.

102
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,090
Two lines are commented.

103
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,650
That means your pie transcript won't eggs.

104
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:18,850
Good.

105
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,650
1st 2 lines.

106
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,500
No,

107
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,080
I'm running.

108
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,950
You're getting your butt in two lines.

109
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,020
No year slash and is especially character and it is called New Line.

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,600
So whenever if you include slash end after slash and whatever you're having that in four,

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,450
you will get in the next line like this.

112
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,440
Right?

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
So there's you're having some special characters.

114
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,250
Let me discuss at least some off them,

115
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,800
and we're going forward.

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,810
We'll discuss remaining things based on the requirements site.

117
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,410
So first thing,

118
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:59,000
special characters you have to write always your special characters inside off your

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,750
quotations,

120
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,350
right.

121
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:13,310
Special characters only inside off court that courts maybe single quotations,

122
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,190
huh?

123
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,140
Some double conditions.

124
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,780
You can use anyone off that right now.

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:26,550
Very 1st 1 What we are discussing is this is God New line night.

126
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,160
No,

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,650
let me go with the slash b and this is called backspace.

128
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:41,850
See how it is going to work.

129
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,410
So,

130
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:43,850
guys,

131
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,690
whatever you are having inside off your skip that thing,

132
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,750
you can also run from your fight on shell.

133
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,110
Just simply type on your command line,

134
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,650
python,

135
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,350
and then you will enter into your potential.

136
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:04,080
Let me copy this line and based it on your fight on common line or potential.

137
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,650
Onder said output.

138
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,590
Right now from here,

139
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm explaining your special characters So what?

140
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,940
I'm going to type yet.

141
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,350
Same thing you can write into one file and they can execute.

142
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,970
I mean,

143
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,910
you can create one bite on.

144
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,950
Script on you can excluded.

145
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,890
Let me print simply.

146
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,150
Hello,

147
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,610
Lawyer.

148
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,240
You're getting some old put?

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,450
No,

150
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:33,950
no one I'm doing is just before you were or I'm reading slash b and c the output.

151
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,550
There is no space between your two words,

152
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,630
right?

153
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,550
The reason is slash b will send your car circulation back.

154
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,050
One creation back.

155
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,280
That's why after hello,

156
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,530
actually,

157
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,260
you have a space,

158
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,610
right?

159
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,300
That space will be removed because your custody is coming back.

160
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,070
One question that is the purpose.

161
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,070
Off slash b So you for right co two slash base,

162
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,410
right,

163
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,870
Because off one slash b,

164
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,870
your cursor will come back One position on 2nd 1 more question back.

165
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,140
See,

166
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,050
that boy is missing.

167
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,290
It's actually first.

168
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,910
Your python will type Hello After that,

169
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,480
because of this slash b,

170
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,090
your customer will come to this situation again.

171
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,580
One more slash b Because of that,

172
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,300
you're Kirsten will come to this war operation and from there onwards you were next world

173
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:32,790
will type if reid three slash beasts see that put So your customer will come back.

174
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,310
Three poison questions.

175
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,120
And from there it will try to override your existing information with the new information.

176
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,600
Whatever it is they're after.

177
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,700
It was last beasts.

178
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,150
Right?

179
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,560
So that is that slash b No peace lasted.

180
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,780
You know that.

181
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,860
What is the purpose of Tab?

182
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,150
Right.

183
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,630
Let me show you that.

184
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,670
Here it's very simple.

185
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,700
So we told her time.

186
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,090
What is the airport on with the type of what is door poor?

187
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,260
Just you're providing time,

188
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,990
space and note.

189
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,450
But that's it.

190
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:07,490
Like fine Mexican.

191
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,310
See,

192
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:21,620
I suppose I want to print information like this print by daunts class.

193
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,520
Something like there.

194
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,840
Yes,

195
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,710
it's working perfectly,

196
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,050
right?

197
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,350
No,

198
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,750
First after this one.

199
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,490
So in your prince statements,

200
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,680
you can also use injured off double condition.

201
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,440
You can also use single quotations.

202
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,550
Nobody will work.

203
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,140
But in this case,

204
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,220
if I tried to write pythons,

205
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,110
you'll get done.

206
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,920
Syntax er involves index you're getting the reason is so drink.

207
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,950
You are printing some string string should be there inside off your quotation.

208
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,660
Actually,

209
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,600
we're Brighton will take the starting quotation on these.

210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,590
The an inclination.

211
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,220
Then what about this information So now what do you want to do?

212
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,810
Is this is starting quotation on?

213
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,650
This is an inclination on the RB escape here.

214
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,030
Fight your fight on should not consider this as a quotation Single quotation there.

215
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,660
In that case,

216
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,020
you have to write a slash escape symbol slash now because of that,

217
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,400
what it will do is your python simply will skip this as a quotation.

218
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,210
It will take this as a some letter some character and it will preserve in output.

219
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,640
Sit output No,

220
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,720
it is not like a quotation.

221
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,220
It is like other than Kardashian some character like Fine not only there Sometimes Yard

222
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,170
writes doubles.

223
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,150
This is a by dawn class and you want to write fight on in double conditions.

224
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,860
So you know this is starting on.

225
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,950
This is ending but between If you have any quotations right?

226
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,510
You can escape from that simply as of now you run,

227
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,060
you will get an Earless I mean an invalid syntax.

228
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,060
You will get only starting on ending condition He's 41 string in.

229
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,290
Really?

230
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,800
If you get any quotations you are to escape from the purpose off your conditions Other time

231
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,150
yacht read simply slash So that you are quotations will be considered as any character

232
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,250
other than your quotations.

233
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,940
No,

234
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,350
See that?

235
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,150
Thank you.

236
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,630
No slashes for escape.

237
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,350
Symbol.

238
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:34,150
Okay,

239
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,290
then.

240
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,950
But we know one thing.

241
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,010
So I will do one thing Ice.

242
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,950
Let me go with my desktop.

243
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,810
It may be any any for lead.

244
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,600
So here what I'm doing is I'm creating a new folder.

245
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,950
Call new itself.

246
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,170
Right.

247
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,800
So I'm going to create something new.

248
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,850
Then what is the part off this?

249
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,870
So this is the part,

250
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,150
right?

251
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,540
Let me print this part with your bite on,

252
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,930
because that is a string.

253
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,850
I can print it.

254
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,770
But see that?

255
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:08,930
Good.

256
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,080
What?

257
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,750
You're getting right.

258
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,250
See growth whenever.

259
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,520
If you're providing,

260
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,890
you were part in your world.

261
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,740
Fight on that too.

262
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,790
Only with no spot.

263
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,500
Because in windows you how this backwards lash.

264
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,480
But whereas in length,

265
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,830
you know,

266
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,840
forward slash.

267
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,420
So this is the problem already.

268
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,450
We know this is lashes for our escape symbol purpose.

269
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,360
But in your python,

270
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
I mean in the path in windows part,

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,350
you have that symbol right now you have to escape from that symbol.

272
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,560
So actually,

273
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,040
you know we escaped from any character you're using escape symbol.

274
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,070
This is slash in your python the same way you can use in your python windows part also in

275
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,450
this way.

276
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,100
But simply remember that whenever if you're providing with no spot,

277
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,850
you have to write to two slashes manually.

278
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,220
If your python skip is going to find any part of true logic you don't,

279
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,730
Father,

280
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,450
you know nobody.

281
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,570
But if you're profiting manually,

282
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,950
some windows part.

283
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,120
We're working with your pipe landscapes.

284
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,550
There you are to write to slashes in your pot.

285
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,950
Then only it will work.

286
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,950
Right?

287
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,460
So this is very,

288
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,990
very important,

289
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,220
guys,

290
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,660
those who are working python for windows.

291
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,200
Okay,

292
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,250
if you are working with your nose using python So whenever if your entering part manually,

293
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,810
we know spot only with no spot.

294
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,450
There is no problem with the UNIX systems parts.

295
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,110
They're injured off.

296
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,430
Single,

297
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:46,860
flashy,

298
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,410
hard to provide double slashes.

299
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,950
Right.

300
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,810
Okay,

301
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,250
so there is.

302
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,790
There is.

303
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,490
There are some other symbols as well.

304
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,820
Like slash a repeat and alert.

305
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,560
Sound alert.

306
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,100
Sound right.

307
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,250
Okay,

308
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,650
so we have some more things were going forward,

309
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,680
will discuss some off other special characters as well.

310
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,010
So,

311
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,660
for time being,

312
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,850
you had to know this minimum special characters to work with your fighter,

313
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,390
right?

314
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,860
Okay.

315
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,350
Thank you for watching this video.
