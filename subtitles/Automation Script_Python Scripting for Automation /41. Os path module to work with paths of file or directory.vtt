ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
prince here.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.780
We're going to discuss about boys dot part model.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.520
Actually,

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.950
this way is dark Part is a sub model off ways.

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.950
Let me open my common life.

6
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.650
Oh,

7
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.820
I'm going to open my lining,

8
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.280
Stuntman.

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.730
So here,

10
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.620
let me enter into my python three.

11
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.150
Colonel.

12
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.690
Right.

13
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.760
So here I am going to import ways.

14
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.150
No.

15
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.600
You know,

16
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.900
you can see the list off more operations with your voice.

17
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.950
My face is somebody who always dot pot,

18
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.930
right?

19
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.050
Let me go on.

20
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.640
See there.

21
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.260
Where is door part?

22
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.020
This one,

23
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.900
right?

24
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.680
These are sub model off your who is.

25
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.740
So I want to see what are the operations are there with where is not part So you can do it

26
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.610
one second in this way.

27
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.210
Where's directory or operations?

28
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.840
On your ways,

29
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.420
Dark part.

30
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.770
See that you're getting some off the operations from your ways.

31
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.950
That part right?

32
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.910
I'm this ways.

33
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.820
That part sub model is used to work on parts like you know,

34
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.530
whether partner parties there are not whether that part is the directly or file part right

35
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.530
?

36
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.720
What is the size off that?

37
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.300
What is the when it was created?

38
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.740
What is the access time?

39
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.050
What is a modified time,

40
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.190
right?

41
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.630
Whether it is a soft league or more so in this way to work with your parts were using with

42
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.650
dark part model,

43
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.510
right?

44
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.950
Let me go with some of them.

45
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.640
First thing wears dark part darts.

46
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.140
Operator,

47
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.920
we know where's dot supper is also having you're wastes operated information the same way

48
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.630
ways that part are separated.

49
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.950
Also your operating systems operator.

50
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.660
Right?

51
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.700
Let me do one thing.

52
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.240
Simply brink ways dot spot dot Somebody did.

53
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.550
You're getting your separated off your operating system.

54
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.150
Right?

55
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.280
Then Next one ways dot,

56
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.350
dot dot based name off pot.

57
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.710
First of all,

58
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.430
let me do one thing,

59
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.740
guys somewhat.

60
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.640
I'm going to take a part called home.

61
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.960
Is it to user?

62
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.520
And then some this dot Be like Okay,

63
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.910
let me simply cooperated.

64
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.530
Copy this part and I'm going to enter into my piped on.

65
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.980
Colonel,

66
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.430
are you can also open some script?

67
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.760
Noble,

68
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.560
Let me do it.

69
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.250
This think otherwise B I voy a spot that don't be white.

70
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.750
I'm going to import first away its model.

71
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.960
Right.

72
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.380
Then I'm going to take a part in this rig Ice I don't want to again,

73
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.810
again.

74
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.450
And again.

75
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.250
Ah,

76
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.500
type this part.

77
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.050
That's why I'm take I'm storing my path into variable called part.

78
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.850
No.

79
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.150
What?

80
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.530
I wonder,

81
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.050
please.

82
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.410
Hey,

83
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.350
guys based name means night See in this entire park Let me show you that.

84
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.820
First,

85
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.170
bring ways dot Part adore based name off your part.

86
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.570
See the output body or getting right?

87
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.680
Let me spell this on.

88
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.600
Run this with your pipe on three.

89
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.450
Sit output night.

90
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.150
So,

91
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.480
you know,

92
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.510
given part based name means this is what is your exert last ending value in your part?

93
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.050
It may be directly or part right.

94
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.050
You have one more thing that is Let me print now Ways dot,

95
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.750
dot dot Directory Name off your part That means whatever the filer part complete part you

96
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.750
are providing in that part What is the directly name?

97
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.510
I mean first let me run this before running this Let me open your script once on then I'm

98
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.200
going to run.

99
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.950
So actually you are running a script,

100
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.840
you know What is that?

101
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.320
Directly name off your part.

102
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.560
See,

103
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.820
guys,

104
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.220
if you take this is the part.

105
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.660
This is called directory name for this fight.

106
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.580
Right?

107
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.320
See the output You're reading that one only based name means this party are getting

108
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.040
directly.

109
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.450
Name means you are getting this part.

110
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.660
So this is very,

111
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.480
very helpful,

112
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.020
but never riff.

113
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.710
You're installing some packages,

114
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.200
like Fine.

115
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.740
Then what is the next one ways That part?

116
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.340
That giant.

117
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.010
So this is used to join two parts.

118
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.860
Suppose guys.

119
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.790
Just imagine that you don't how this ways dot part our joint operation.

120
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.440
Now what I want is I want to add two parts.

121
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.040
There's not me.

122
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.400
Enter into my fight or internal.

123
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.110
So before going to render pregnant Wait this.

124
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.810
No,

125
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.640
I'm going to under in the fight on the let's say,

126
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.550
having two parts,

127
00:04:50.550 --> 00:05:00.350
but one is supposed route home then part of who I am having some easy to user.

128
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:09.060
Now I want to add these two parts.

129
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.610
You know,

130
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.770
these two are strings.

131
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.340
You can add it like if you remember,

132
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.950
you can act two strings in this way.

133
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.540
String one bless string.

134
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.040
Do right.

135
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.230
See,

136
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.520
that is,

137
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.970
er yes,

138
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.520
you're getting,

139
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.050
but these two are the part between these two parts.

140
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.750
Usually all parts separate Roswell.

141
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.560
That means manually.

142
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.450
You need to are your parts operator part one.

143
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.430
Bless your parts operating off your operating system?

144
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.630
No,

145
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.730
I'm working with UNIX operating system.

146
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.800
That's why I need to go.

147
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.080
I need to provide.

148
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.610
This was last.

149
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.790
If it is when those other slash you have to provide right then,

150
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.140
Father,

151
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.340
in this way you can get it.

152
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:56.950
But but nobody feel writing s group in that you're doing some You're adding some two parts

153
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.950
.

154
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.280
But based on operating system,

155
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.120
you need to provide slash But you could take this one.

156
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.700
I mean,

157
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.500
let me take import west.

158
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:13.250
Let me bring now weighs dot part Don't join just I'm providing part one and part two I'm

159
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.810
not giving the separator to Are these two parts python will take care based on your

160
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.150
operating system See that I'm not giving this slash No,

161
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.400
By default,

162
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.930
your python is providing that slash If it is windows,

163
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.340
it will provide different slash.

164
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.510
If it is you next year it is supporting this one.

165
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.880
So after medical,

166
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.450
your python will aren't by providing your parts operated between two parts.

167
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.570
So it is very,

168
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.400
very important race adding two parts C two parts are strings.

169
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.520
You can also add your strings in this way,

170
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.240
but whenever if you're doing in this way Based on operating system,

171
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.180
your toe probably was slash But if you take western border,

172
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.890
join python will take care of what?

173
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.700
You are separated.

174
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.510
That's it.

175
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.050
Simple.

176
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.950
Then where's that part that split?

177
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.900
So what are the part you're having in your hand?

178
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.540
Right?

179
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:09.090
If you if you split that it is going toe split the part name India Pale Which country stuff

180
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.300
Head.

181
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.650
Until I mean let's say somewhere we have part right.

182
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.650
Let me take this part.

183
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.350
Assume that this is a part.

184
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.150
This is it.

185
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.310
But so in this part this is called head and this is called tail.

186
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.980
See if I do simply ways let me print the result directly.

187
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.190
Are you guys You can also assigned this operations or put into some variable wears dark

188
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.520
park door Split your part Whatever the part you're having in your hand See the result

189
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:45.460
You're getting a couple which consist off head Until not this operational port you can

190
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.340
assign You know this is you know,

191
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.850
but dot b a r name or put This is based name common or put You have done this right?

192
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.720
Ah based name.

193
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.520
And then the a R name.

194
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.250
That's what it is.

195
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.950
Giving split operation is going to give the air name and then based name or put.

196
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.850
Fine.

197
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.540
No,

198
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.960
just get the path size.

199
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.300
I mean,

200
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.000
what are the file you have in your hand?

201
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.750
I want to get the size for that.

202
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.990
Seaways dot,

203
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.990
dot dot Get sizes The operation.

204
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.230
I see nothing,

205
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.480
is there.

206
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.030
You don't worry where these are operations are there the air off?

207
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.000
Where's that part?

208
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.530
Will you list off operations from that?

209
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.240
I'm taking some of them for time.

210
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.910
Being unbinding for this operation will give your result in terms off bites.

211
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.430
I see What I'm saying is you don't remember all these operations.

212
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.150
Just a have a glance once here.

213
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.420
So from this,

214
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.350
I'm taking some of them.

215
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.450
Right?

216
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.600
Sorry.

217
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.660
Not waste or separated.

218
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.040
Right?

219
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.650
Where is dot dot That's it.

220
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.250
Fine.

221
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.280
No,

222
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.650
next one is Where is the part that exist?

223
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.600
You guys just assume that you are going to start some obligation to start some application

224
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:02.600
.

225
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.750
You have some common for that application on your operating system.

226
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.000
So to start the application,

227
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.790
I intern some popular fight,

228
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.620
but before winter,

229
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.550
and make sure that whether it is there or not?

230
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.070
If it is not there,

231
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.200
you can't do anything right?

232
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.330
That's why just for you've condition purpose,

233
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:18.910
right?

234
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.530
You can use this one ways.

235
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.400
Dark part dot exists.

236
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.900
You are part if really your party's existing guys,

237
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.760
our parties,

238
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.400
I store somewhere partners This one if there's not,

239
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.240
is there,

240
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.550
then only I condone it as you are getting proof.

241
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.700
See,

242
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.750
What I'm saying is I can buy the simple by transcript in this I'm taking in this way.

243
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.150
Ive Where's that part that exists?

244
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.260
You're given part.

245
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.850
Then I can say print your file is there,

246
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.170
right?

247
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.100
So let moronic else else.

248
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.070
If that is false,

249
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.250
then I can say that Print this.

250
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:12.650
Let me bring it is not present on this coast.

251
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.550
That's it,

252
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.800
right?

253
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.350
Let me down it once by 13 scape.

254
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.090
Yes.

255
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.960
You are getting your file,

256
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.440
is there?

257
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.760
What I'm doing is I'm just going to modify my part value something like that Is your wife

258
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.090
in user?

259
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.440
Is there?

260
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:30.620
No,

261
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.990
I'm removing some Your letter?

262
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.580
No,

263
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:38.250
that is not a valid part on my host Now if I run there See is not present on this host.

264
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.530
Yes,

265
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.350
it is not present.

266
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.370
So to take some decision based on your file with if condition,

267
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.950
this is also helpful.

268
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.790
Right?

269
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.340
Then see,

270
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.000
given part,

271
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.100
maybe file part or Barrett report.

272
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.250
You can take it.

273
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.400
Where is not part that is file in case.

274
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.210
Whatever the part you're providing.

275
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.990
If there is a file part than this Valley will do output as it true,

276
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.350
then if it is a direct report,

277
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.350
then ways that part that is very,

278
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.350
very well do that output 1000 direct.

279
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.070
No,

280
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.170
see that what I'm doing is I want to decide.

281
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.510
I want to decide whether the given parties a file or not.

282
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.680
Then what I will do.

283
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.050
Let me come into all these lines.

284
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.970
But I'm going to commend all these lines now.

285
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.150
I'm implementing a simple skip.

286
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.850
That is,

287
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.750
if where's that part dot is filed?

288
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.960
What are the part you're having in your hand?

289
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:42.250
Then I can say that Bring he's a fine,

290
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.790
that's it else.

291
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.710
If it is not a file,

292
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.450
we have only one other option that is,

293
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.850
bring bring your party's under a tree.

294
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.720
That's it.

295
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.720
So I can use only ease file,

296
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.320
and I can decide because if it is a file.

297
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.850
Then where's that part that is fallible becomes true.

298
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.750
Then you're going to split this line,

299
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.800
right?

300
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.550
See the airport?

301
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.450
Yes.

302
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:20.200
Know what I'm doing is I'm going toe money for your part.

303
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.910
I'm going to give upto directory.

304
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.920
I no see,

305
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.760
that is what you're getting is a directory or getting?

306
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:29.940
Yes,

307
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.530
it's a territory.

308
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.550
Previously you got find no reason territory.

309
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:39.160
Now to check that I can use a dirty he's frail operation are is directory operation in your

310
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.120
if conditions.

311
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.210
Then where's that part?

312
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.100
That is Link.

313
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.420
See?

314
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:44.850
You know,

315
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.850
sometimes we have some soft links.

316
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.750
Right?

317
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.750
Let me check it.

318
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.850
Is there any soft link?

319
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.480
No.

320
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.190
Let me do one thing.

321
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.840
I'm going to create a softly.

322
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.390
Where's that part?

323
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.450
I'm going to create my voice.

324
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.350
Something like that.

325
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.010
No.

326
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.440
See that now?

327
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.180
My waist is a soft link,

328
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.790
right?

329
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.620
I want to check that with python.

330
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.950
Whether it's a soft drink or not,

331
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.410
simply import your ways.

332
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.780
You can also write your strip.

333
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.890
I'm I'm going from from command line.

334
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:28.560
I see Bring ways door part dot is link Then just to provide You were I suppose my waist

335
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:28.850
files.

336
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.530
Are you can also avoid complete part.

337
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.020
As I know,

338
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.980
I'm in the same location.

339
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.240
That's why I'm not providing complete,

340
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.310
but yes,

341
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.650
true.

342
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.370
But what I'm doing is where is not part of that is Linc.

343
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.190
I'm providing Suppose what is underscore but not the way.

344
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.340
This is not a softly in this.

345
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.030
Simply a file,

346
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.350
right?

347
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.250
That's we're getting open as false.

348
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.330
So based on this true and false,

349
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.330
I can tell that this is a softening on this is that this is not a soft ling by using if

350
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.050
condition.

351
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.200
Right.

352
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.040
So,

353
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.350
guys,

354
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.640
these all are these some of the operations from your ways that part and which are very,

355
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.120
very helpfully new real time.

356
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.390
Along with dark,

357
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.150
you also need access time,

358
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.280
right?

359
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.550
Some creation by mortified time.

360
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.890
So these times you can get from your waist are pot.

361
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.250
Where's that part that get access time.

362
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.760
But to understand these three operations,

363
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.520
you should be good with some time model off your python.

364
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.630
So after discussing time model,

365
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.010
one second will come back toe your ways.

366
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.450
That part and I will explain about these three operations,

367
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.000
right?

368
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.450
Okay.

369
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:38.740
Okay,

370
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.020
