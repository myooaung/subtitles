85
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:41,740
64 bit install now merited We install your python in this location right somewhere here.

86
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,520
I don't want to install in this location.

87
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,580
I want to install in my require location,

88
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,150
Right?

89
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,050
What I will lose.

90
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,150
I will go with custom installation.

91
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,450
And also you can are everywhere by 20 not 72 parts.

92
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,280
So this if you're working with fight on three I mean,

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,150
if you're installing Python three then only will get this option.

94
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,890
If you installed fight on two right?

95
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,140
You won't get this option.

96
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,760
Now I'm selecting this and customization off your installation Justly gun there.

97
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,630
See that gays are by tone 372 parts.

98
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,110
Then customize installation.

99
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,400
Nothing.

100
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,150
But I want to change my park.

101
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,890
I mean,

102
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,750
where I want to install my part on software.

103
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,670
So for that I'm changing in trough install.

104
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:24,920
Oh,

105
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,900

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,470
Then simply click a next no year trough,

107
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,720

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,050
What I warm going toe ace simply I'm installing somewhere here by tone.

109
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,720
See currently you can also provide your user home.

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,300
There you can install or simply can provide your required,

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,450
but I'm taking this one.

112
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,750
Just install.

113
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,310
That's it.

114
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,150
Very simple.

115
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,950
Not only this sort resort sound or Joe any three door next.

116
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,400
Washington's very simple to install.

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,090
Like once it is done,

118
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:07,950
then I wish for you just wait for some time on anybody.

119
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,860
Meanwhile,

120
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,450
we will see one more thing in a web of shell website documentation case.

121
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,050
See here NA Commendation.

122
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,820
So you help by phone reader X documentation as well as fight on uber X documentation.

123
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,560
If you can.

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,730
Don't know this or by opening this you can go through your official documentation on you

125
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,650
can learn your piper,

126
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,050
right?

127
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,350
So you hope documentation for three nordex on products in your official website itself.

128
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,720
So if you want,

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,250
you can go through that and again learn your fighter,

130
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,550
right?

131
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,850
Fine.

132
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,410
No,

133
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,450
Once it is done,

134
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,340
I want to show you one more thing.

135
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,710
That is once.

136
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,000
If your installation is done,

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,610
Then you had to cross check whether you successfully installed your pipe on read or sound

138
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,320
or Joe or not or you re quite right on Washington,

139
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,950
right?

140
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,250
It's almost done.

141
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:12,360
Just wait for sometime.

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,780
It will complete

143
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:57,350
states

144
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,880
taking time just right for some more time.

145
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,100
Once that is done,

146
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,790
then almost your installation is done.

147
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,060
But we have to cross check.

148
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,150
We had a very fight,

149
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,040
so I will show you that.

150
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,360
How do?

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,950
Very fine,

152
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,460
right?

153
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,110
Just give me some time so that or installation will be complete.

154
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,520
Yes.

155
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,090
Now see that python terror 70 at two parts.

156
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,350
So it starting now it's almost done.

157
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,050
Fine.

158
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,080
Sort of was successful.

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,320
Yes,

160
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,350
to close it and just open your common lane,

161
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,550
right?

162
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:36,450
Simply run python space you are washing.

163
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,920
See that you're getting or you can also run.

164
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,850
Simply python space haIf on Capitol V right?

165
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,650
And you can also check.

166
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:53,590
See that So people is nothing.

167
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:59,140
But if you want to install any required third party piped on modules with help off people

168
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,980
you can able to install right anyway,

169
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,590
we'll see how to install on how to work with people while going forward for time.

170
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,600
We just We are installing fight on under.

171
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,150
Then we are verifying whether we install your fight on successfully or more like.

172
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,650
See if you want to go with your installation location.

173
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,670
Just like on the work.

174
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,050
See this one?

175
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,770
Anyway,

176
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,620
I hope I don't to write ex husband,

177
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,700
right?

178
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:29,920
Well,

179
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,520
going forward.

180
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,680
Sometimes I will show you what is.

181
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,890
The difference is between EUR three or decks and cortex.

182
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,680
So for that,

183
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,910
I installed fight on to run X as well.

184
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,750
So just know we installed this one fight on three directs.

185
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,540
So these the by turns off there bite on especially.

186
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,350
It is called interpreter Bite on interpreter.

187
