ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
friends here are concept.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.870
Please bite on shuttle model.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.390
See,

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.540
this shuttle model is the default model with your pipes on two or by country on.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.940
This model provides us a number off high level operations on files and directories.

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.420
They are like copy,

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.250
more removed and much more.

8
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.360
See,

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.220
using ways model also weaken.

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.070
Do some file operations,

11
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.410
but combat ways model shuttle model is having our drones level operations first,

12
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.010
let me show you the list off operations or functions which are available with your shuttle

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.390
Modern.

14
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.050
So we have some syntax to list them.

15
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.770
Let me open my colonel.

16
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.620
Bite on shell.

17
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.970
First,

18
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.120
let me import shuttle model,

19
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180
then simply used a or shuttle.

20
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.590
If you ever hear we're having different types off error exception handling on some

21
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.250
operations with your shuttle modern.

22
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610
There are different types off operations,

23
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.540
right?

24
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.340
So here,

25
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.560
I'm going to explain aboard your shuttle model,

26
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.450
step by step.

27
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.880
So in this part,

28
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.350
we're going to discuss a boat operations with copy liger thing.

29
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.600
I suppose if you want to copy files or directories using turtle model,

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.550
then what are the functions are available with the washer till morning,

31
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.730
right?

32
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.850
See that if you have that here.

33
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.090
Copy.

34
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.620
Copy to copy file.

35
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.550
These are the copy littered operations with your shuttle model.

36
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.140
And one more thing,

37
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.660
you can you the shuttle model with UNIX,

38
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.550
like system also.

39
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.950
So this is my send ways.

40
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850
Let me enter into my pipe on three.

41
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.840
On here.

42
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.100
Also,

43
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.150
you can import your shuttle when he can see the list off operations.

44
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.000
Right.

45
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.640
So here our concert,

46
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.110
please.

47
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.650
How to copy files with your shuttle model?

48
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.550
Soto,

49
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.200
copy.

50
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.180
We're having different types off functions with your shuttle model.

51
00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.650
Why?

52
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.650
These many operations are functions.

53
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.650
Let me explain them step by step.

54
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.830
So suppose we're going to discuss all these things,

55
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.050
right?

56
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.350
So first of all,

57
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.450
let me take my complete fight on part.

58
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.850
So this is my fight on three parts on this host.

59
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:28.450
So already taking a script name as should be part one dot the way?

60
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.150
No.

61
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.480
So if you want to copy a file,

62
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.620
you need source and destination First,

63
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710
let me take source.

64
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.870
I mean,

65
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.600
some fighting.

66
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.650
So I'm taking from this location one of the fight.

67
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.700
Let me take one by one.

68
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.090
So,

69
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.850
source in this location I house up with this creep So I'm taking that then destination.

70
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.140
Also,

71
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.650
I'm taking same part first,

72
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.230
so if you take same,

73
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.450
but there is no use,

74
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.150
but I guess if you take same,

75
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.110
but what will happen?

76
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.790
Shuttle dot Copy.

77
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.350
Fine.

78
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.310
So that is if you go in this order than it is very easy to understand about all these

79
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.100
operations.

80
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.350
So I will write my order to explain about copy operations with the what?

81
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.340
Shuttle model?

82
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.350
That's fine.

83
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.450
So shuttle copy file source to destination.

84
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.940
No,

85
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.150
just come here.

86
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.050
So you hope this strip,

87
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.830
so no,

88
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.750
Let me run this and see the result.

89
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.700
What happened?

90
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.730
Yeah,

91
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.250
I forgot to import shuttle model.

92
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.150
Let me import that first,

93
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.120
nor understand.

94
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.750
See the desert.

95
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.930
Same file.

96
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.450
Hello.

97
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.350
So your shuttle model is giving an exception.

98
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.920
Same file error,

99
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.680
actually,

100
00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.450
if you want to.

101
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.040
Ah,

102
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.550
copy a file from source of destination by taking so so.

103
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.710
Conditions are same with same filing.

104
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.870
Then there is no use support.

105
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.950
I won't take a backup.

106
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.320
Then there is some use,

107
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.590
right?

108
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.290
So I'm taking this Knysna as some back off.

109
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.750
I know you feel run this so I'm running our script now.

110
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.310
It's done.

111
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.480
Now again.

112
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.400
See list files walking with remorse and was not the way these the file and we have taken

113
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.650
called back off for that.

114
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.250
Right?

115
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.920
And if you observe here,

116
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.560
this file was created.

117
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.590
Suppose September 22nd.

118
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.350
But this will creator just know.

119
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.250
And what are the permissions here?

120
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.550
These permissions and these permissions are completely different.

121
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.140
But why taking backup?

122
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.950
Suppose I want to house same permissions off my source file,

123
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.270
then don't use copy file the news copy.

124
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.780
Simply settle,

125
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.450
not copy,

126
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.710
source and destination.

127
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.350
So before going to take it,

128
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.250
I am removing previous backup fight.

129
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.150
Let's be clear.

130
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.890
So why?

131
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.650
I am taking copy into off copy files.

132
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.150
See you for dick.

133
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.140
Copy Fight.

134
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.580
It is not preserving the permissions off your source of file to your destination.

135
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.850
Fine,

136
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.980
but if you go with copy What?

137
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.430
Don't The permissions are there with your source file.

138
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.750
Same permissions will be there for your destination file as well.

139
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.910
No,

140
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.880
let me run our script on offer that Just see that this is the back off.

141
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:53.010
I just know we have taken using you were a copy operation and see the permissions he had

142
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.450
under here.

143
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.550
Now they are seen But apart from permissions,

144
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.950
I want to know how the entire meta data as a tease.

145
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.070
Whatever it is there for your source file that entire matter data I want for your

146
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.450
destination file as well.

147
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.880
That means timestamp also,

148
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.000
I don't want to change.

149
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.600
I want to get this times time for my backup file.

150
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.450
Then use copy two months.

151
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:36.000
So they say if you come from here to here but emissions the way I'm taking copy operations

152
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.000
,

153
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.750
same permissions for sore sent destination.

154
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.050
So now I'm using Shea till the heart copy to operation.

155
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.370
So before that,

156
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.090
let me remove once again my backup file.

157
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.550
And no,

158
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.250
I'm running.

159
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.950
I was script.

160
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.620
I will see there is a 40.

161
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.770
We heard back off.

162
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.410
Fight on your order source on this nation?

163
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.050
No,

164
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.570
for the board.

165
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.220
The files were having same permissions and same times time,

166
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.950
right?

167
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:23.150
So seem meta data for this nation as well.

168
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.750
That's a So now we done with copy file first,

169
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.150
then copy,

170
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.450
then copy Toe.

171
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.150
Right.

172
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.750
Copy.

173
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.750
Then go with copy too.

174
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.040
No.

175
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.400
You have some idea why we're using copy file or copy or copy toe right now.

176
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.450
Let me go with copy more First,

177
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.540
we're done with this three.

178
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.100
Right now.

179
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.400
Let me go with copy more.

180
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.700
I see nothing.

181
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.250
Is there?

182
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.250
Copy more.

183
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.870
What?

184
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.270
The world.

185
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.160
The permissions are there with your source of file.

186
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.390
That part emissions only I want to get for my some destination file.

187
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.200
But here,

188
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.400
make sure that it is not copying your file.

189
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.000
It is giving only permissions off source files.

190
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.900
Destination file.

191
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.150
See that?

192
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.890
Suppose if you have got here,

193
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.850
let me.

194
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.580
Yeah,

195
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.050
for this only I'm giving some permissions.

196
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:23.290
Seven w So for this shuttle model,

197
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.880
we're having seven double Jiro permissions.

198
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.850
So this permissions I want to provide for this fight,

199
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.350
Then take this as the source file.

200
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.850
Very simple days.

201
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:45.240
Whatever the permissions are there with the word source.

202
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:53.790
If I that permissions will be given to your destination file.

203
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.720
Now let me come.

204
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.310
And this.

205
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.950
So before running our script,

206
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.310
yeah,

207
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.590
we need to wired soon Backs as well,

208
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.750
right?

209
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.850
Shut the door.

210
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.250
Copy moon source and destination.

211
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.090
Be clear.

212
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.050
It is giving only permissions off your source files for destination file.

213
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.550
Make sure that your source Sunday's nation must be exist,

214
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.750
right?

215
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.250
No.

216
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.790
So before running our by done scrip.

217
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.790
What is the part?

218
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.040
Mission.

219
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.050
Solve this 77 fight Double seven fight.

220
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.450
Now we are providing this permissions to this file.

221
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.850
So we have given for that logic in our script.

222
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.550
So no ticket.

223
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.840
So one of the permissions are day for your back of fine what all the permissions are there

224
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.040
for.

225
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.550
You are.

226
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.250
This is scraped that permissions has provided to your destination file.

227
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.940
But we are not copping.

228
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.070
See that God,

229
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.320
right?

230
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.550
These different content anywhere.

231
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.550
This file is different country.

232
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.670
So with the with our logic,

233
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.450
we're providing only more permission off this file to this fight.

234
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.970
But we are not copying.

235
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:13.750
Be clear.

236
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.810
That's fine.

237
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.350
Then.

238
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.620
Copy.

239
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.000
Stand.

240
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.900
See why we're using copy to operation Way copying.

241
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:29.290
I want to get entire meta data off this file to this nation for him.

242
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.570
So it was You already created your destination file,

243
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.350
but you want to get some moderate off some file,

244
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.510
So I mean,

245
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.550
you want to assign some meta data off a file to another fight?

246
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.700
Nothing.

247
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.850
Is that suppose I just updated there.

248
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.150
So we created this file number one.

249
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.580
What other data is dead here?

250
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:50.810
I mean,

251
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.070
date is that 22.

252
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.010
So along with permissions,

253
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.550
I want to assign this timestamp toe my file.

254
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.450
Then you have to use copy stat.

255
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:11.010
Simply shuttle door copy.

256
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.450
Start source to a destination,

257
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.550
right?

258
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.310
No.

259
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.250
Let me run these and see the results.

260
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.950
Saudi sorts spelling mistake.

261
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:33.230
So that's previously you are back of file Timestamp is this one?

262
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.890
Now we are assigning this times time to I'm in this time stamp to your file.

263
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.850
I just observed that.

264
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.090
See the timestamp off your back.

265
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.140
Oh,

266
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.110
file on You are by Don Skip is same on permissions as well.

267
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.640
So Empire Meter data will be assigned to you.

268
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:52.950
What?

269
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.320
This nation fight.

270
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.790
Make sure that you're not copying the content off your file to your destination file.

271
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.150
You are giving on Lee,

272
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.050
But emissions,

273
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.050
that's here.

274
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.140
See,

275
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.220
the content off this fight is different.

276
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.270
Is the content and the content off?

277
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.320
This file is different,

278
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:13.550
right?

279
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.350
This file is different not to.

280
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.950
That's fine.

281
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.550
No.

282
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.600
Yeah,

283
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.130
myself.

284
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.790
This copy file of it is nothing.

285
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.450
But you know,

286
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.800
you can open a file using weapon are read more on.

287
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.160
You can write that content into some other file using right more so the file object?

288
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.470
What are you created?

289
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:42.190
That file opposite can be copied from one file Object to other file after using Shopify

290
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.650
lobster.

291
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.270
Just assume there you just drive it.

292
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.990
This logic Yes,

293
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:52.540
Operation that there is a ah file call X wiser daughter.

294
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.320
Txt!

295
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.450
I'm opening that in.

296
00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:05.430
Read more and I'm creating one more file Object Some pick ur door Txt But this isn't right

297
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.800
more right now If you want to copy the content off your phone to,

298
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.650
you have to then use shut the door.

299
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:19.650
Copy File A BSEC your fun.

300
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.350
You have nothing.

301
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.640
You just drive it this No,

302
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.390
we are planning with one more operation that is copied three See nothing.

303
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.880
Is that corporate?

304
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.440
Three years useful to clone or copy?

305
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.380
Entire directory Weaker.

306
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.050
Suli to your destination.

307
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:43.030
Let's say suppose I'm having some calm.

308
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.630
Cut mine.

309
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.820
So if you after that Tomcat nine.

310
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.280
We're having different that there dis structure for that.

311
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.850
I'm indifferent files and folders in that right?

312
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.650
No,

313
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.870
what?

314
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.630
I want to please.

315
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.790
I want to copy that entire direct restructure into some other file.

316
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.550
Let's say copy three.

317
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.450
Let me take no source Eyes I'm going to create new source.

318
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:15.390
Grace Com Kurt seven.

319
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.760
Suppose no source.

320
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.850
Then destination.

321
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:21.180
Badly.

322
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.930
I'm giving under temp.

323
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.450
Suppose our Tom card.

324
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.650
Seven.

325
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.550
You can take any name Hungered 78 Tomcats up with some $7.

326
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.200
Eight.

327
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:35.850
Something like that,

328
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.850
Right?

329
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.550
No,

330
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.410
let me run this.

331
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.720
So before going to run,

332
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.950
let me check it.

333
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.720
Is there any Tom got?

334
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.050
Nine?

335
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.590
I mean something.

336
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.250
Come get seven are simply Tom.

337
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.740
Get that is your wish.

338
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.510
You can take any destination battery?

339
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.750
We don't know any Tomcat here.

340
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.090
No,

341
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.550
let me run our fight on script.

342
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.650
Oh,

343
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.380
study source.

344
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.950
I'm mr the Slash Here.

345
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.750
It's a done no check.

346
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.390
Tom.

347
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.480
Car has been created.

348
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:18.300
And make sure that it is giving entire meta data.

349
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.820
Whatever you're having for your source that my target,

350
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.960
I will be provided for your destination as well.

351
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.350
Using copy the operation from your shuttle Morgan?

352
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.050
Nothing.

353
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.630
I Your last point samples,

354
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.050
guys.

355
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.780
Yeah,

356
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.870
if you want to remove.

357
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.050
If you want to remove,

358
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.660
are directly structure records.

359
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:41.850
So,

360
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:42.520
vicar silly,

361
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.750
then simply you can use shuttle dot Remove three.

362
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.180
Simply your destination.

363
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.650
So I'm going to remove this part.

364
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.000
Only marital.

365
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.660
You can provide your destination order weaken.

366
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.950
Store your destination into some variable,

367
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.340
some DST variable,

368
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.650
and then you can use that very but otherwise directly can probably your source on this

369
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:12.570
nation parts any what operation itself so removed tree.

370
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:17.010
So it will remove the entire Barrett restructuring personally.

371
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.400
So suppose.

372
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.950
But if I run there and see the the implication you don't know Tom card here,

373
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.350
that's it.

374
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:33.350
So is these are the simple copy file operations with your shuttle Modern.

375
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.790
Okay.

376
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.190
Very,

377
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.010
very useful.

378
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:41.270
You are no upside or some line excitement site or maybe any admin,

379
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.060
like blah sick or dead office,

380
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.150
because you are going to take some backups right on.

381
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.410
And your database side.

382
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.380
Sometimes you need to create the same times term for your destination as well.

383
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.440
So at that time,

384
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.760
you can use simply copy to operation from your shuttle money.

385
00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.650
Okay.

386
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.440
Okay,

387
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.750
guys,

388
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.150
Thank you for watching this video.
