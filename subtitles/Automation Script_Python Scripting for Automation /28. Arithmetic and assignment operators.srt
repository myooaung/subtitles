1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
friends here.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,060
We're going to discuss the first of two operators off your fight on there are automatic an

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,250
assignment Operators.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,160
First,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,650
let me go with your art emitted cooperators.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,540
See,

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,650
we hold or different types off automatic operators.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,720
They are like,

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:17,880
you know,

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,120
already belong in your mathematics addition.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,730
Subtraction.

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,510
Multiplication division Modelo.

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,920
Right.

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,550
So here floor division is somewhat a new one.

15
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,250
We will see that and the exponential.

16
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,740
So these all or the your art emitted cooperators,

17
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,350
right?

18
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,990
Let me weapon my fight on terminal there.

19
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,850
I can easily explainable them.

20
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,750
Let me enter into my pytorch internment.

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,650
Quite uncommon line or bite on shell.

22
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,400
So I said directly,

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
I can do supports two plus two.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,920
I mean,

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,650
any number you can take not only to place to some four plus two.

26
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,810
Right?

27
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,750
So this is just to perform additional for two values,

28
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,280
right?

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,150
So I can start this result in tow.

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,070
Some very blast for let's say,

31
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,470
result.

32
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,310
Because toe are you can take any variable addition off to number.

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,150
Something like that are simply some because two r s equals toe.

34
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,750
Yeah,

35
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,780
variable is your wish,

36
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,150
right?

37
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,940
No,

38
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,420
just a print.

39
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,150
Curious?

40
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,710
You are getting right.

42
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,030
Not only like that,

43
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:28,350
just you can store the water up values in some variables on Let me take seek Austria plus p

44
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,160
and then print your c So,

45
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,570
like ways you can do your subtraction.

46
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,550
Multiplication,

47
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,120
Right.

48
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,350
Let me do one thing.

49
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,260
C equals two,

50
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,760
um,

51
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
minus B.

52
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
So he's four.

53
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,850
And because she ate the result is minus four.

54
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,330
No,

55
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,580
let's say Sequels to you,

56
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,110
Toby.

57
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,950
No ces 32 late.

58
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,650
No,

59
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,340
let me do one more thing.

60
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,850
See,

61
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,050
cause too if I take four days in eight,

62
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,950
right,

63
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,150
Reserve these Do not fight,

64
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,740
you know,

65
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:05,980
right?

66
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,750
Four way facilities,

67
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,850
other ways just to do 8 May four.

68
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,030
Then see,

69
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,850
that isn't zero.

70
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,050
Okay,

71
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,330
So,

72
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:17,580
guys,

73
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,650
by default you're getting You were reserved in terms off flute.

74
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,150
So this easy with your piped on three.

75
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,470
But if you go to fight on two,

76
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,970
if anyone off the value is float,

77
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,590
they know,

78
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,750
then only you'll get result as float number.

79
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,640
Right?

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,420
Anyway,

81
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,170
we're working with bite on three decks.

82
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,990
Right on.

83
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,650
We know these the off future fortune.

84
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,950
I mean,

85
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,630
from 2020.

86
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,600
We hardly you this one,

87
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,350
right?

88
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,450
Fine.

89
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,340
Now let me go.

90
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,650
Don't worry about this language is just I'm going to clear my screen,

91
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,660
find no exponential.

92
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,130
Suppose if I want to find something like three square are some four power three how you can

93
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,000
find c three square.

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,150
You convey the 32 stars,

95
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,420
then to know there is nothing but three square desert.

96
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,670
These nine of course,

97
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,350
you can store your values into,

98
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,850
let's say,

99
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,600
a cause to fire.

100
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,180
And because to some three now,

101
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,760
if I want to find a power fight esto story Yep,

102
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,190
would be are five power t a fight Cuba,

103
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,580
Right.

104
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,860
A cube I can do later in this way are this way.

105
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,980
Just under the result.

106
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,780
Want to fight?

107
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,910
I can start that into some variable cord results.

108
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,830
Are any variable?

109
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,870
Let's say here to the power bi No,

110
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,080
simply printable result.

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,150
And see the value,

112
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,850
right?

113
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,480
No,

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,140
if you have a job,

115
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,860
we covered all the operation.

116
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,100
Yeah,

117
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,420
we help ending with Modelo and then we'll say floor division.

118
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,600
So Modelo,

119
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
let me take some number days.

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,350
Ah,

121
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,650
somebody.

122
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,750
I'm going to take some seven If I want to divide this with two,

123
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,310
23 just six nobody's The remainder value one right now see,

124
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:28,360
what I'm doing is seven remind that cool result is one like way.

125
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,810
Suppose if you divide eight with two,

126
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,000
then what is the remainder?

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,870
So it reminder to is always Jiro.

128
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,050
We know that just to find your reminder you're using the mind of symbols.

129
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,920
Then the last one is floor division.

130
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,250
I see that like nothing is there.

131
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,120
Just stick two times your slash our division symbol.

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,830
See the result for right now,

133
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,930
what I'm doing is no.

134
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,060
See,

135
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,940
that isn't by the four leaf.

136
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,450
You take seven by to what you're getting.

137
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,950
Did you not fight?

138
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,550
If you know,

139
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,490
floor division,

140
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,730
right?

141
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,000
If you know floor division.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,050
See,

143
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,550
yeah,

144
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,710
simply agenda in this output only in this explanation.

145
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,550
23 just six.

146
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,050
Reminder one Your question.

147
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,650
These three,

148
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,650
you'll get this pure Kocian without your floating points.

149
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,970
Right?

150
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,980
And that to you can assume three dot if I actually know seven by six or if you do,

151
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,450
you are seven.

152
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,450
Reminder to what is the value.

153
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,860
So it's seven by two.

154
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,570
What is the value?

155
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,150
Did not fight.

156
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,700
Then you feel a round off that value to low lower value.

157
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,950
Then the result is three So that's what you are getting.

158
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,470
Let's say mine looks a minus.

159
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,450
Mine floored isn't too.

160
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,870
See what you are going to get.

161
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,900
You're going to get minus fight because mine by two is almost forgot.

162
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Fight minus four,

163
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,350
not fight.

164
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,180
Right?

165
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,620
See,

166
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,630
In your number system,

167
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,710
this is minus fight,

168
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,750
then minus four.

169
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,390
So comfort of minus four minus Phi is the lower value.

170
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,690
Know what would the result you are getting for that resulted?

171
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,510
You're getting a round off,

172
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,670
Lou that two lawyers thrown off value not for a minus,

173
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,460
for not fly around off value as a lower value is always minus five.

174
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,550
That's what you're getting here.

175
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,070
So that is the uses off your floor division.

176
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,450
Right.

177
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,550
Fine.

178
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,600
Then next one is assignment operator.

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,500
She already we know one of the assignment or better.

180
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,860
Like if I read execution to what your doing do value.

181
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,220
You're assigning PXE.

182
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,700
Okay,

183
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,370
so what I can do express scoop less for then guys,

184
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,310
whenever you have equal symbol here,

185
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,900
equal operator here for the sequel operator.

186
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,780
Always the right side.

187
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,670
Whatever you hope.

188
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,980
That expression will be value later.

189
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,650
First.

190
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:12,750
Then that result will be assigned bx see what our the expression you have with help off

191
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,720
equal symbol.

192
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,350
Let's say exit causes some three express to as you Mexico to some three value.

193
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,070
So Europe,

194
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,050
I don't don't bother over the year exceeds their headaches.

195
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,100
Is that your button?

196
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,710
Don't bother aboard their first.

197
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,150
You take equal symbol.

198
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,750
Then it will forget about this.

199
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,370
Whatever their on bites.

200
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,450
I first of that value will be evaluated on that result will be assigned to this variable,

201
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,980
So X is three 32399 plus to 11 11.

202
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,950
Blessed be X.

203
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,500
If you want to get the result from your common line,

204
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:56,450
let me take X equals 23 Then I am reading X equals two X into three or three X Bless some

205
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,750
to now See the result X value 11.

206
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,120
So that is simply assignment operator or your equal symbol is basically an assignment

207
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,560
operator.

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,890
But see Veneman,

209
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,380
if you right,

210
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,720
yeah,

211
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,750
cost you Please be.

212
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,190
And after that,

213
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,170
here he is there.

214
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,720
Here also.

215
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,980
Is that so?

216
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,100
In this case,

217
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,610
instead of writing your expression,

218
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,600
lengthy expression,

219
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,910
you can also write other a shortcut expression as in this very year.

220
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,800
Plus it was Toby,

221
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,550
not only for this If after all these things right,

222
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,420
see a they raised a Is the rays there?

223
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,850
So on board the sites for your equal symbol,

224
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,620
but nobody fairway.

225
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,170
Yea right Then under time.

226
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:39,850
What do you do?

227
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,150
What you can do is just to remove this year and then right place before you recall symbol,

228
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,730
right?

229
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,650
That's what I do here.

230
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,250
Now this boat to expressions are going to give same result.

231
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,660
So if you want to get the proof,

232
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,190
just open your terminal.

233
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,220
So here,

234
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,260
let me take initially A because of some two on because of some three value.

235
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,410
If I radiate cause two year plus B,

236
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,290
what is the result?

237
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,350
Just after that fight?

238
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,300
No,

239
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,430
I'm going to reassign you Coast to two and then be Corsetti.

240
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,160
Now what I'm doing is your place because Toby and see the results.

241
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,990
That means if you write either this expression or shortcut expression board will use same

242
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,450
reserve.

243
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,850
Right?

244
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,550
So these are the assignment operators on about your art emitted cooperatives as well.

245
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,450
Okay,

246
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,650
okay.

247
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,580
And one more thing.

248
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,710
So they suppose if you want to define a simple automatic calculator,

249
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,150
let me do it here.

250
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,250
So I'm going to design simple,

251
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,660
ultimately color with help off or only recent symbol for time be because you can perform

252
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,940
any operation for timing.

253
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,150
I am goingto create only addition or the money calculator.

254
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,910
Okay.

255
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,190
Otherwise,

256
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,140
simply addition calibrated,

257
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,710
not be white.

258
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,490
Just Abdul.

259
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,740
Here,

260
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,940
guess what I'm going to do.

261
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,410
East.

262
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,450
Suppose if I take a course to some three and because of some fight,

263
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,650
and I want to find the result result because to nothing but the A plus B on I can drink

264
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,250
using your thing.

265
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,150
I can bring the edition off.

266
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,820
Yeah,

267
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:43,250
on be equals two r Is I reserved right suitcase.

268
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,200
If this is your a python script or python program in this,

269
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
your four lengths see for any line.

270
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,560
If you have there,

271
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,290
there is no space at starting that is the rule off your pipe on that is a basic room for

272
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,740
your pipe.

273
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,020
And don't probably a space before starting,

274
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,360
any line undid.

275
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,300
And unless if there is any special requirement for that as of no other normal length,

276
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,850
straight forward straight lines,

277
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,120
right?

278
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,310
That's why I'm I'm not giving any space before starting your any off the line,

279
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,050
right.

280
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,380
But nobody feel run.

281
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,650
Your python will run your program from top road on line by line.

282
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,570
Then what is the very first line?

283
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,410
Yaeko city.

284
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,840
That means somewhere in memory.

285
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,130
Yeah.

286
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,900
Value will be assigned as three.

287
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,980
Same may be then reserved.

288
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,370
You know,

289
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,680
a place based audition.

290
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,170
So you ever lose three and we will lose Fight three plus fight eight.

291
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,350
You're assigning to result.

292
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,290
Then you are printing those values,

293
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:40,550
right?

294
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,850
That's what we are doing here.

295
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,380
No,

296
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,050
let me say we on running.

297
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,660
So I'm going to save it.

298
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,310
And you know how to run your bite on.

299
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,520
Skipped our program from common line.

300
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,050
Simply your Python interpreter space You are program name.

301
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,650
That's what I'm doing here.

302
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,270
See,

303
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,920
there is no off three.

304
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,150
And five is 80 are getting.

305
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,820
But if I had on this program again and again,

306
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,150
I'm going to get same result.

307
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,160
If it is addition Caligula there it should not give the addition for fixing numbers,

308
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,900
but nobody.

309
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,150
If you're running that script,

310
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,050
that program,

311
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,150
it has to take two values minimum from user,

312
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,310
you know.

313
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,480
I know,

314
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,750
But if you want to provide input for your script,

315
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:28,450
you have a command or statement called Input in your fight on in part on three or decks.

316
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,050
Let me open our script.

317
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:38,300
See here into not fixing my values to Yaeko.

318
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,450
So three and because to fight what I'm going to raise Let me come in these two lines now.

319
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,150
Yeah,

320
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,750
value really from input.

321
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,410
So revelation is usedto evaluate.

322
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,380
You were given value,

323
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,480
so enter forced number for the just in four.

324
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,350
You know already about ur input then Same way I want to get be value from import.

325
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,870
So important.

326
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,320
Early work.

327
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,850
Second number.

328
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,700
That's it,

329
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,570
right?

330
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,360
No.

331
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Let me say this hand.

332
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,200
See your core ones,

333
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,350
Whatever you have.

334
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,930
Right?

335
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,560
So that's if you are very here.

336
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,150
1st 2 lines are commenter.

337
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,850
That means you're fightin wont to conserve those two lines says you were pride fight on

338
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,750
program lines.

339
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,080
No,

340
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,350
very first line is this one.

341
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,150
So whenever you feel on top,

342
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,230
though,

343
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,450
don't you know that the very first line is year equals two?

344
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,650
We know we know what there is an equal symbol that is an assignment operator,

345
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,030
but nobody feel an assignment Operator assignment or burger will try to get first right

346
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,810
side value.

347
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,750
Whatever you help.

348
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,630
No invite surgery or some syntax.

349
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,040
This is helpful to read something from common line.

350
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,340
So whatever I'm going to provide on common line that will read by this expression on that

351
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,820
value will be assigned to yea by your equal symbol or with your assignment operator.

352
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,530
Right.

353
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,550
Let me run our cool.

354
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,150
What That would be how?

355
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,550
See that?

356
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,300
And they're forced number.

357
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm wondering number six.

358
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,950
Suppose there emerged early in the second line.

359
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,620
Right?

360
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,150
You how once again enter second number.

361
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,960
So because off this enter first number I'm wondering six.

362
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,410
Then I'm going toe press enter on my keyboard so that this six will go on store in the year

363
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,550
with the help of this expression.

364
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,290
This index right,

365
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,770
then immediately in the next lane you How entirely were second number?

366
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,210
I'm going to understand something.

367
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,350
Number called nine.

368
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,790
Not so you're getting 69 Result is 15.

369
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,390
None of your program is like,

370
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,760
you know,

371
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,250
simple addition Calculator like,

372
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:57,540
but offered being some on one level concerts.

373
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,010
You can design a simple automatic calculator with your pipe on.

374
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,900
That means addition,

375
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,370
subtraction,

376
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,740
multiplication division model,

377
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,620
low floor division,

378
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,330
whatever.

379
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,050
The operator,

380
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,050
whatever the operation you need all those operations you can do with help off your bike,

381
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,710
conscripting so for that inner toe include some logic before,

382
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,730
including some logic.

383
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,470
You should know some concepts will discuss that concert force.

384
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,930
And then we'll once again design a full fledge it automatic calculator with help off your

385
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,750
pipes on scripting.

386
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,640
Okay,

387
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,150
for time being this very simple one.

388
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,940
Okay,

389
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,220
So,

390
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,410
guys,

391
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,780
here we discussed about art emitted cooperators and assignment operators and also how to

392
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,120
read any two numbers and then how to find addition.

393
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,600
The same way you can try for you are our dish subtraction,

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,730
Multiplication division,

395
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,770
Modelo floor division and exponential.

396
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,910
You just trade right?

397
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,360
This separate buy dance good for each and every concert to hear.

398
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,250
Whatever TV help,

399
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,850
Right?

400
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,050
Fine.

401
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,420
Okay.

402
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,050
Thank you for watching this for you.
