00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
friends here.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.680
We're going to start about the models off.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.140
Pipe on,

4
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.540
right.

5
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.450
Let me start it.

6
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.110
What is a model?

7
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.550
So in Piketon model is like a file or fight on program or python script.

8
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.470
So simply a model is a file containing fight on definition and statements.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.950
So definition and statements means right,

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.580
like functions,

11
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.180
glasses on variables.

12
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.930
So there's as off.

13
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.340
No,

14
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.070
you don't know what is the function on what is a class,

15
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.380
you know,

16
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.540
only variable in case from other programming languages.

17
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.230
If you know functions and classes,

18
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.360
it's well and good.

19
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.090
If you don't know,

20
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.650
Don't worry.

21
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.050
Right?

22
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.720
So,

23
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.420
simply remember,

24
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.750
that model is a a file or python program.

25
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.520
Rpai transcript which consists off your python logics.

26
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.650
Simply right.

27
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.450
Fine.

28
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.670
Then what is the use off model?

29
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.120
Simply reusability purpose.

30
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
So how you're going to reuse your python script,

31
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.050
right?

32
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.240
Let me write to two scripts.

33
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.050
Then I can show you how you can reuse that.

34
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.720
See,

35
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.980
guys,

36
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.810
just a gender.

37
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.850
I have a value.

38
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.850
Let me take,

39
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.350
um my module as it one script name.

40
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.470
So actually,

41
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710
my requirement days I have a value.

42
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.640
My value.

43
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.700
My value Is this much?

44
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.190
Yes,

45
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.950
Arjun that this much is my value.

46
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.250
No,

47
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.780
I am going to use this value in supposed 10 other programs,

48
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.150
or ever transcripts.

49
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.900
So in each and every script I need to define this value,

50
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.160
right?

51
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.240
Exactly.

52
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.050
We thought any type O.

53
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.920
I need to define your value perfectly.

54
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.500
Same way.

55
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.810
What?

56
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.220
Our I different year Some 4635 or something like that.

57
00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.670
Exactly.

58
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.850
This number I never define in each and every script.

59
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.020
But I have some confusion that I may be our type some wrong value instead of giving this

60
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.440
Were you in my 10 scripts?

61
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.750
That's why what I'm doing is in one script I'm going to defend my value.

62
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.150
Then this value without a defining I can use it in other scripts as well.

63
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.350
Then how you can use it?

64
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.550
Let me write one more script Here.

65
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.610
Let me You in the name as forced to skip dressage.

66
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.000
Sorry.

67
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.650
First skip not be way fine.

68
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.540
See,

69
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.170
now my requirement is whatever the my value variable is there And you are my model dot The

70
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.750
way skip that variable I want to use in my current descript.

71
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.230
Yes,

72
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.950
you can use it.

73
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.950
So if you want to use you are variable off other scream.

74
00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.650
The very first step in your current skipped work you have to do is unit to write import.

75
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.350
You were previously scripted name in which you define your variable,

76
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.480
right?

77
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.340
But don't right dot The way we thought,

78
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.450
Not the way you have to read your script name.

79
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.540
So my script name is actually my model dot the way.

80
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.650
But here I am writing simply my model.

81
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.250
That's it,

82
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.250
right Fine,

83
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.750
no,

84
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.750
for your current descript,

85
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.450
my model script is a model,

86
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.850
right for your current escaped.

87
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.160
What are the skit name?

88
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.950
You hold importer that is called simply more deal for your current A script.

89
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.980
Actually,

90
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.130
that is also one script.

91
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.280
But whenever if we import this script into other step now for other strip your previous

92
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.640
script,

93
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.920
which is importing that is a model that's a see.

94
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.790
Now what I'm doing is I'm going to print the variable value,

95
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.450
which is there in your previous a script.

96
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.050
So if you want to display the variable,

97
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.460
or if you want to use the variable which is there in your previous trip,

98
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.550
the first thing you have to import that skip name without dot The way extension?

99
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.350
Yes,

100
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.150
I'm importing.

101
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.250
Then after that,

102
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.170
if you want to display your variable value.

103
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.100
But if you want to use your variable value,

104
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.100
what you have to do is your script name than dot dot My value.

105
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.620
There is a variable in your previous clip.

106
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.950
Right?

107
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.050
See,

108
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.930
in this escape,

109
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.050
these are variable.

110
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.590
So if you want to access this variable,

111
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.730
you want to mention first your previous script name Whatever you are importing dark this

112
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.150
value,

113
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.190
right?

114
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.050
See that?

115
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.030
No,

116
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.650
I am running.

117
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.650
See the output?

118
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.810
You're getting some value.

119
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.160
Actually,

120
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.570
we're not defending this variable,

121
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.780
right?

122
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.300
But you're getting because this variable is there in your previous program,

123
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.500
our previous scrape on in the current strip.

124
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.950
You are importing that so that I I am reusing that variable in different scripts.

125
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.150
So this is the are going days with your modules.

126
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.770
Suppose if I am not importing right?

127
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.160
Let me say we don't money.

128
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.320
See the output you're getting in a My model is not defined without having that how you can

129
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.260
access So in the current program to know that there is a one escaped called my module.

130
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.520
He hardly imported first on before going to import.

131
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.350
Make sure that as off?

132
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.600
No.

133
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.140
As off.

134
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.270
No.

135
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.940
We are working with the basics,

136
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.600
right?

137
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.150
Make sure that those two scripts are there in the same location.

138
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.050
If reason a different location,

139
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.840
how you can access that We will see.

140
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.420
Going forward for time.

141
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.630
Me Whenever.

142
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.490
If you want to import one script in tow.

143
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.150
Other strip,

144
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.460
right?

145
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.860
What?

146
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.750
The script should be there in the same location.

147
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.730
That's a no See the output?

148
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.550
Yes.

149
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.250
Right.

150
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.800
So you know,

151
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.610
for example,

152
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.570
we have created our one model.

153
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.750
Right?

154
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.750
I There are some default modules with your Pitre.

155
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.550
There are some default models.

156
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.110
Suppose I just assumed that you are working with the mathematics.

157
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.650
The value off buys a common right.

158
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.540
I mean,

159
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.550
uses off your value off by is very four months in audio.

160
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.050
That's why.

161
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.440
See that there is a model called Matt default model with your python.

162
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.650
So that default models you don't bother about there directly imported.

163
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.910
Right?

164
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.040
How to know whether Matt is a default model or not?

165
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.810
I will show you right for timing.

166
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.460
Just as soon die.

167
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.850
There is a model called Matt.

168
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.690
Then I'm importing that right.

169
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.930
There is a pre defined program called Matt.

170
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.130
I'm importing into our current strip.

171
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.790
Then you can say that your math is it.

172
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.110
More deal are to import any model.

173
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.490
The procedure is important,

174
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.850
Matt.

175
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.060
No.

176
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.890
In your math,

177
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.300
you have a value called people B.

178
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.170
I fight by variable value.

179
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.050
Let me print it.

180
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.990
See that?

181
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.290
You know the value,

182
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.550
right?

183
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.850
That's what you're getting?

184
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.350
No,

185
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.350
you don't remember this Bible,

186
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.750
you know,

187
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.230
because in the nobody fair working it bite on there is a default model called math.

188
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.310
Apparently import that on from there.

189
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.930
Access.

190
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.350
You were P I variable so that you are getting your pie value.

191
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.450
But you are the initial stage.

192
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:28.140
How you know what other different models are there with your fight on how to use that?

193
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.780
Secondly story.

194
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.310
First of all,

195
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.950
your don't know what are the different models are there with your python?

196
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.910
Nothing.

197
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.250
Is there simply weapon your python shell or bite on common line?

198
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.450
Let me and they're into my fight on by typing Fight on.

199
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.860
Then simply write help,

200
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.820
help in quotations.

201
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.250
Just write more jewels and then hit Enter.

202
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.140
Just wait some time so that it is going to collect all the default models which are there

203
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.050
with your fight on.

204
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.710
See while installing or python right along with your python.

205
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.130
It will also install some models.

206
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.310
So these all are the models,

207
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.560
which all day with your piper.

208
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.970
But don't worry.

209
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.650
You don't need to learn all these models.

210
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.550
I already told you at the very beginning,

211
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.950
based on you were interested.

212
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.380
Area where you're going to use your python.

213
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.050
Based on that,

214
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.050
he hard to learn the models.

215
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.850
She's there is a model called Math.

216
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.890
There is a model called Matt.

217
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:29.910
No,

218
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.390
you know,

219
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.650
there are different models here,

220
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.800
right?

221
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:42.830
Then how you will come to know that is how I mean how to use that Matt model or how to use

222
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.050
any module which is there with your python.

223
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.070
Right,

224
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.230
guys biting fall.

225
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.270
There is a documentation with the aura fight on.

226
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.650
If you want to know that,

227
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.660
first of all,

228
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.290
select anyone off the model I want to work with.

229
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:56.950
Suppose,

230
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.900
Matt.

231
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.750
Matt model.

232
00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.670
Right?

233
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.930
So from your common laid sell directly,

234
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.750
simply import Matt right.

235
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.460
Then see the I r.

236
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.650
Off Matt.

237
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:18.970
Then you will get some list off operations which are available with this matter Module For

238
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.660
time being.

239
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.460
Don't consider the operations which are there with underscores.

240
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.040
They are for documentation.

241
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.530
Purpose.

242
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.690
You don't worry about them Other than this I mean,

243
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.700
guys,

244
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.760
the These are first of all,

245
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.650
all our operations in this.

246
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.550
These are for documentation purpose.

247
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.280
Okay,

248
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:35.750
as I've no,

249
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.450
don't touch them upto this Start from here.

250
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.450
Not these All are the operations with your math module.

251
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:50.850
But suppose I want to know to power three.

252
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.900
Then pour off to come on three and I want to know that by value.

253
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.940
But here you may.

254
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.250
How some small contrition when No What?

255
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.010
I'm finding power.

256
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:08.350
I'm providing values but for I am not priority because by is a constant value.

257
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.150
If it is a constant than that is a variable.

258
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.050
But poet,

259
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.540
you need some input,

260
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.890
right?

261
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:15.600
So for what?

262
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.780
Well,

263
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.530
you're going toe.

264
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.310
Find out Cover right to power.

265
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.990
Three to keep two square Tobar four to bore fight you need We were values to find the

266
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.650
powers.

267
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.950
That's why see whenever if input is required.

268
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.430
That type of operations are called something like functions so that he is a function and

269
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.550
this is a variable.

270
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.200
See,

271
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.310
you know there is a definition for your model Model Consists off functions,

272
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.540
classes on variables for time being.

273
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.160
First we observed variables.

274
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.960
Now,

275
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.490
if you take your mat function,

276
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.270
P a is simply variable.

277
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.650
I'm in constant value,

278
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.060
right?

279
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.050
But Bobby's a function simply again as off.

280
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.200
No,

281
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.090
you just remember,

282
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:03.370
if any operation with parentheses them that is a function if any operation with parents is

283
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.350
that is a function function needs always some inputs,

284
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:14.650
like so based on situation you can provide input are sometimes you're pardonable

285
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.250
automatically take required input.

286
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.150
So it really is a function you help.

287
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.720
That entity is if it is a value,

288
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.950
you have only like variable.

289
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.750
Thank,

290
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.090
but how you can come to know whether you need to provide input or not?

291
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.670
Nothing is there once again the Harvard document for that.

292
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.650
Let me do this,

293
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.800
Matt.

294
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.650
Help Matt.

295
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.520
So before going to list out all liver operations,

296
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.560
you have to do import your particular module,

297
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.950
then the air off your model name so that you will get this one.

298
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.230
If you want to see the documentation,

299
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.050
just simply run helping Matt.

300
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.430
I want to see that you're going to get document.

301
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.950
So this is a function because you have parents to see or know otherwise.

302
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.960
If you have to hear functions badly there mentioning these are the functions so functions

303
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.560
here.

304
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.610
The mad functions need some input.

305
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.120
See that excess elements You units some.

306
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.350
You are to provide some input.

307
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.450
You have a lot off functions here,

308
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.060
right?

309
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.990
With your Matt for all functions,

310
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.250
you need to provide some input.

311
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.010
Just Abd already.

312
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.730
Maybe sometimes you might have function without any value.

313
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.150
Also,

314
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:29.380
I will show you that type of things in with other models and come down just simply just to

315
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.010
go keep,

316
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:30.550
uh,

317
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.960
last see here.

318
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.940
Day dies that data.

319
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.430
Apparently we don't function evil.

320
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.500
You pie value,

321
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.390
right?

322
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.030
You hope so.

323
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.140
These are not functions directly.

324
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.150
Data you are getting.

325
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.280
So after observing this one,

326
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.500
you can't decide directly by seeing them without having any practice.

327
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.050
We can't decide whether it is a function or variable our data our value.

328
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.420
Right.

329
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.070
So this because you are at initial stage before going to use any model,

330
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.500
just have a glance once on help off your model.

331
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.170
Just enter in this way.

332
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.340
I'm just go from top to down at least once so that you can get some idea.

333
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:15.710
Ho,

334
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.570
This function is giving are taking some imports.

335
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.810
And this function is giving some output.

336
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.180
In this former something like that,

337
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.000
you will get an idea just to go through that once.

338
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.350
All once.

339
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.980
See suppose from your Matthew.

340
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.710
How One more operation court a lot off operations.

341
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.050
Here,

342
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.510
let me take one more thing.

343
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.590
See?

344
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:37.650
First of all,

345
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.500
let me run this.

346
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.690
There is a operation called Factorial.

347
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.110
You know,

348
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.890
in mathematics we have a factorial,

349
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.210
right?

350
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.800
So simply matt dot factorial,

351
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800
but simply fire on this.

352
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.050
You're getting another light.

353
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:55.450
Takes exactly one argument digital given That means here you are to provide some argument.

354
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.300
So factory love what number you need.

355
00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.490
That's what you are to provide.

356
00:13:59.490 --> 00:13:59.850
Here,

357
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.060
let me do number 4 24 is the factory.

358
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.470
All right,

359
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.420
Let me take fine than 1 20 is the factory.

360
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.720
You know that so,

361
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.690
like ways from Matthew are different operations here from here to here,

362
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.680
Right?

363
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.850
So this is the way how you can import your model and how you can use that.

364
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.940
And if you want to know different operations on your model.

365
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.890
Simply import your model then.

366
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.240
Dude,

367
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.540
the air off you are.

368
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.170
I mean,

369
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.050
any model name.

370
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.420
But before running this command on your potential,

371
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.480
make sure that you ran import your model name,

372
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.630
otherwise it won't work.

373
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.690
Let's say the air off CS we actually see is we as a model to work with your CSB files.

374
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.610
But Europe item saying that CSB is not defined because before running you would be air

375
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.250
operation.

376
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.570
I need to be imported.

377
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.380
Not just know,

378
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.410
importer on the now I'm seeing the air of CSP.

379
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.780
No,

380
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.690
these all are the operations with your CS three module,

381
00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.170
right?

382
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.000
And I don't know how to use that.

383
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.750
Then simply run helps us we Then you will get a document just to go through that once each

384
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.450
and every thing is defined here,

385
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.450
you'll get complete idea hope to use your seats remodel right.

386
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.050
But I'm giving one more recession.

387
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.060
You know,

388
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.750
always Google is better,

389
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.050
right?

390
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:27.610
You can easily get require its in Texas with your Google.

391
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.530
Let's say see,

392
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.550
I'm going to type.

393
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:39.050
How do work with excel sheets using python?

394
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.650
That's very light.

395
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.210
Of course you have someone is there,

396
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.540
but instead of that.

397
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:44.830
Even God,

398
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:45.230
Directly.

399
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.280
Some documentation.

400
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.350
Let me see that.

401
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.750
Let me open this website.

402
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.180
This one,

403
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.130
some some links.

404
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.250
We just open it like See,

405
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:05.080
there is a model called Excel wt Using that you can work with your excel seats.

406
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.550
That's it.

407
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.170
No,

408
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.310
no,

409
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.440
no.

410
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.350
The thing where you about which model you need for your requirement.

411
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.630
Anyway,

412
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.510
we're going toe completely different on Google.

413
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:12.680
Only,

414
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.050
right?

415
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.690
Yes,

416
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.450
it's very easy.

417
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.260
But once evil practice,

418
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:17.430
you know,

419
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.460
need to search in Google.

420
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.140
Apparently,

421
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.580
you can remember,

422
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.180
and we can use your require model for your requirements.

423
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.250
Right.

424
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.090
So that is the uses off model.

425
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.360
So finally,

426
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.610
you can conclude that by using models,

427
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.950
your work will be very easy to work with your fight on.

428
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.660
That's why you actually,

429
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.650
even ever if you're learning,

430
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.310
fight on,

431
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.650
you should concentrate on more models,

432
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.700
right?

433
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.890
If you know more models,

434
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.060
you can write your script in effect to manner,

435
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.930
right?

436
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.470
So there's well going forward.

437
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.660
We'll go with the different models with step by step by.

438
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.260
Fine.

439
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.100
So just I'm giving you a note.

440
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.740
If you want to create your one model,

441
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.980
you have to write escape name with my model.

442
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.640
Any any name?

443
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.500
Not only my model.

444
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.730
Just your script name got away on you can import that as a model.

445
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.690
In other script,

446
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.450
we thought about the way extension.

447
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.050
That's it.

448
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.050
Right?

449
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.160
And guys,

450
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.740
basically,

451
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.620
with your fight on,

452
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.350
there are two types off modules.

453
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:20.110
One is default models on second witness,

454
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.350
third party models.

455
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.540
See,

456
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.680
just now I open the link in your Google,

457
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.050
right?

458
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.070
How to work with your Excel States.

459
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.450
If you are very here,

460
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.210
you can work with the excelsis using Excel WT model.

461
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.640
Let me do one thing.

462
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.510
I'm trying to import that model on my fight on.

463
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.120
It's giving another no mortal name.

464
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.640
Call Excell.

465
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.550
W d.

466
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.540
That means these not the default model with your python.

467
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.620
So once if you install your python,

468
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.230
you will get only some of the models.

469
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.410
Not all the models,

470
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:52.680
you know,

471
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.390
invite anyhow,

472
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.370
one like 40,000 models,

473
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.550
right?

474
00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.350
So study some will.

475
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.850
The u l E s do you know,

476
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.770
invite on you how one like 47,000 models,

477
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.660
but all models you're not getting here.

478
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.340
Only some of them you're getting right.

479
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.850
That means these are the default models on remaining all our third party models.

480
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:25.910
So just now I show you that walk with your excel seeds you need excel WT model.

481
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.230
Or that is just to write your excelsis the same way.

482
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.050
If you want to read or excel sheets,

483
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.710
you need excel already model.

484
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.160
But those models are not telling your python.

485
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:42.350
Then hope then hope nothing is that just come through here.

486
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.090
There is a command with your python once.

487
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.310
If we install your python,

488
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:55.930
they if you want to see that on your windows operating system Were you going for a while

489
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.210
Also?

490
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.390
Sure.

491
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.090
You want to wear UNIX like systems as well?

492
00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:03.160
I see radio install your pie time Guys are very in Chile off this course.

493
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.300
Suppose I installed both the Russians.

494
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:12.990
Let me go to fight on 37 See here Help Python Somewhere in scripts he hoped the poor people

495
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.550
three people read or $7 seem all our look at the same point.

496
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.340
BP is there are 50 yards are not people.

497
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.760
So this is the common through which you can install any third party model,

498
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.700
right?

499
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.850
See if I want to install in third party model What I always first awful.

500
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:42.350
I need to provide complete part way might be Piece that in this way.

501
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:48.390
Then install Excel WD so to write excelsis I need X LW to model.

502
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:53.120
Then I came running this way so that your acceptability model will be installed so that we

503
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.260
can use that to work with your Excel sheets using your fight on.

504
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.430
But before running this common,

505
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.010
make sure that you should out Internet connectivity.

506
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.940
Right?

507
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:08.120
So there's one more thing if you already added this part of your system path known into

508
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.920
probably complete part right.

509
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.260
See that I'm removing this part because I already added my part where people's installed

510
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.020
that part.

511
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.640
I aren't to my system parts.

512
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.490
That's why you definitely I'm running between stole Excel wt right?

513
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.440
Just wait.

514
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.880
It is going toe collect your excel double D model.

515
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.160
Make sure that Why learning this come and you should have an Internet connectivity Now it

516
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.680
has been installed successfully.

517
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.730
Let me do one thing.

518
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:40.650
I'm going to exit right Let me re weapon Because once if we install the hard to reopen your

519
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.770
eternal then entering your python Colonel,

520
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.870
try to import your ex eligibility.

521
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.120
Previously you are you are getting another.

522
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:55.190
But now you are not getting another because it is there Now I want to read Excel seats.

523
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.350
Then there is a model call XLR D.

524
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.600
But that is not there.

525
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.550
Then what do you do again?

526
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.060
Come out from your potential.

527
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.280
Simply pip,

528
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.090
Install,

529
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:16.990
Excel or the that like find so these away How you can install it.

530
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.210
What?

531
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.550
Third party modules.

532
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.300
I suppose if you want to work with AWS,

533
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.670
then there is a model called Boto three.

534
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.810
Then you want to run deep.

535
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:32.050
Install Bordeaux three like that's it.

536
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.580
So otherwise,

537
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.920
I want to work with some remote servers using Python.

538
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.240
Then there is a model called part of my core.

539
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.160
Then he had to run Pip Install para maiko or fabric.

540
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.160
There are different models to work with the remote servers.

541
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.490
One of the model is part of Michael.

542
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.780
That's it,

543
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.250
right?

544
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.210
We will see All those things were going forward with stepsister.

545
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.000
Fine.

546
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.560
And finally you have to know one more thing.

547
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.280
Yeah.

548
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:02.540
Anyway,

549
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.050
days before going to use any model,

550
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.660
right?

551
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.820
You hardly important that first import either default or third party models before using

552
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.160
them.

553
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.360
But before using third for the model.

554
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.520
Just check it once.

555
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.970
Whether you have a that our party mornings with your python soffit or not,

556
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:20.830
if it is not very,

557
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.550
can install it,

558
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.600
right?

559
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.260
You simply by running Pip install you are.

560
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.950
What's your name then?

561
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.410
Nice as off.

562
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:29.720
No.

563
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.690
To import your third party models.

564
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.210
Right?

565
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.660
We are following this procedure.

566
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.860
Import your model name.

567
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.160
Let me do one thing.

568
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.760
Let me weapon my bite on strip.

569
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.960
See?

570
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.850
I am importing in this way Import Matt.

571
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.770
So from that I'm printing ph value heart.

572
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.450
Let me find some.

573
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.550
Pull it off.

574
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.050
Three Power four or three.

575
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:56.900
Port to mine.

576
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.990
I want to get it right.

577
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.950
See the output?

578
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.970
Yes,

579
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.540
it's working.

580
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.160
It is giving.

581
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.950
This is one way to import any module.

582
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.760
There is one more of it.

583
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760
Nineties.

584
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.500
You can also import using from option a name from option.

585
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.000
You have two more methods.

586
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.250
That is from Matt Import all the operations.

587
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.530
The meaning for this is from Matt.

588
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.200
Import all the operations.

589
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.850
See that?

590
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.720
Let me First of all,

591
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.400
let me clear my court.

592
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.450
What I'm doing is injured off important.

593
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:30.940
Matt,

594
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.590
I'm going from Matt Import start.

595
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.450
Right.

596
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:38.310
See you guys.

597
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.810
previously.

598
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.570
Whenever if you do in this way import Matt Noto,

599
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.820
find out you are high value.

600
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.070
Really?

601
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.050
What we are doing math dot p a.

602
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.050
Right now I'm going to come in this court.

603
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:54.700
But if you import in this way from Matt Important star at this time,

604
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.100
don't write like mad,

605
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.410
not be way directly.

606
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.030
Cannot be.

607
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:06.590
I see that are directly can use your operation Our operation off three squared.

608
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:13.150
So you're reducing your your syntax in celebrating math Not be a matter power directly or

609
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.350
writing p a in power.

610
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.970
Right?

611
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:17.850
This is one day,

612
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.790
But,

613
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.200
you know,

614
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.910
in math,

615
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.890
not only in math,

616
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.940
if you go with any model,

617
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.900
you'll have a lot off operations with that butler model.

618
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.340
Right?

619
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.200
But here I am importing all the operations from that model.

620
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.830
But I assume that I don't want to work with all the operations with which are there with

621
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.760
your math model.

622
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.400
I want to work with only P a.

623
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.310
Then I can do in this way from Matt Input only P.

624
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:55.100
I know if I run the court like be a let me say with this or I need powers were late anyway

625
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:55.100
.

626
00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:07.760
Sorry it is not be power so you can import your particular modules.

627
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.670
Not only that days let me do one more thing,

628
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.550
I suppose.

629
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.150
Import Matt.

630
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.760
I'm doing right.

631
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.270
Very 1st 1 So if I do this what I'm doing import math,

632
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.950
not be right.

633
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.970
Then you are getting injured off math.

634
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.550
I can create some different name import matters.

635
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.660
Um,

636
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.530
import.

637
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.290
Mattias IAM.

638
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.810
You're creating your wound.

639
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.550
Name for your module while importing it into your current script.

640
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:45.250
I'll see that if I don't matador be a You're getting another because in your script math

641
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.950
module we are treating as Yum then just tried to write Diem.

642
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:56.060
Not so what is the advantage by creating Aaliyah's names?

643
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.380
Means sometimes some modern names are very lengthy models.

644
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.350
Let's say there is a model called sub process,

645
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.830
so I don't want to type sub process I get and again in different places in my script than

646
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.560
what I will do.

647
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.350
Import some process are simply SP not to.

648
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.260
There is a model call flat form,

649
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:25.870
so let me do one thing first in platform there is operation called System,

650
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:31.210
through which you can find out the taper off your operating system name?

651
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:31.480
Yes,

652
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.520
I'm getting windows,

653
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.080
but I don't want to type platform instead of that.

654
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.500
What I'm doing is input platform SPD.

655
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.680
Then see you're creating Aaliyah's name.

656
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:43.860
Now,

657
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.360
In order to use platform,

658
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:52.680
you have to use PD in your script but to right?

659
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.260
So these are the different ways to import your modules.

660
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.410
Right?

661
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.310
So that is very,

662
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.080
very important.

663
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.660
The very straightforward ways import Matt Somewhat.

664
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.180
I'm giving.

665
00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.100
So in this case,

666
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:13.520
you have to use suppose mad that p a operation are brain some mad dot bought off three.

667
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:13.860
Come on.

668
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.230
Whatever the power you want,

669
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.950
you can find it.

670
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.250
That is one way.

671
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.260
Let me right.

672
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.550
Method one.

673
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:26.110
Right.

674
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.290
But if you don't want to use math,

675
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.010
Azmath model in new a script.

676
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.220
If you want to provide,

677
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.220
you are required name for your model.

678
00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:33.930
Yes,

679
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.550
you can create it by creating Aaliyah's names.

680
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.550
See that what I'm doing is import import,

681
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.440
Matt as some empty podium.

682
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:44.920
Whatever.

683
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.920
It may be your wish.

684
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.220
Right then.

685
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:48.670
Print.

686
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.660
Um dot Be a wanted to take no,

687
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.260
Matt,

688
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:56.350
your toe take'em print e m dot partof do common three,

689
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.760
then method three.

690
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:09.530
See from your to start with the from Matt import all operations in this case,

691
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:18.450
How you're to use is simply B I or print pull it off some four square.

692
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.760
That's it.

693
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.800
It's very easy,

694
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.040
right?

695
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.000
Come back to your previous.

696
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.850
To matters that is somewhat easy.

697
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.450
But while using this,

698
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.660
sometimes you may get confusion.

699
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.350
So I will tell you when you will get confusion.

700
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.480
Right?

701
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.160
Because if you go with,

702
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.910
if you're going to import to three models,

703
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.580
sometimes same name is there with the different models.

704
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.050
Other time you'll get confusion,

705
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.200
right?

706
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.370
So at that time,

707
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.950
we will see for timing anywhere.

708
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.160
These are those tired procedures to import your models in a different way,

709
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.020
and this is the a last preference.

710
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.560
Guys don't prefer much.

711
00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:00.850
This saw this thing from Matt Import only P a on then our operations.

712
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:01.760
So here also,

713
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.960
you can use directly in this way only right,

714
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.350
that's it.

715
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.850
So these are the different ways to imported What modules,

716
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:14.670
Right?

717
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.090
So there's one more thing.

718
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.490
If you want to import to three models into your current script,

719
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:26.090
let's say there are There is a model called Black Form and just know we have seen math,

720
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.040
model and I want the import.

721
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.470
One more model called assists and I want to import ways model and I want to imports of

722
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:39.850
process in this way you can import This is one way or are you can also import directly

723
00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:49.050
Black form comma Matt Comma sees common ways comus up process These also correct.

724
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:54.550
But writing in a single line all models is not good practice.

725
00:29:54.550 --> 00:30:01.930
But if you want to get right it I will prefer this way it is just for looking but because

726
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.140
it is good That's why I will try to use always in this way whenever If I want to import

727
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.940
multiple models with my current script un guys final the point.

728
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:22.070
You don't remember that if you use the modules then you were lent off your court Your

729
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.110
corland will be reduced.

730
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.350
That is that One days with your models.

731
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.700
If you know more models,

732
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.390
you can write affective script.

733
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.160
Right?

734
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.350
