ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
friends here.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.130
We're going to write one simple python.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.700
Strip the purpose off your pie,

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.450
transcriptase.

5
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.350
Find all fights in a territory with extension.

6
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.610
Not the way or dressage.

7
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.380
Or maybe any.

8
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.350
You're required.

9
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.900
Extension,

10
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
I mean,

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.450
while running your fight on skirt.

12
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.130
First of all,

13
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.350
it has to ask the entry Were directory park.

14
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.450
After giving your part,

15
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.930
it has to ask.

16
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050
Enter the extension off.

17
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.850
You're required files.

18
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.380
Suppose Let's say I'm giving dark.

19
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.180
Beware extension.

20
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.010
Then it has to display only dark puree files in a given location.

21
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.070
So it was.

22
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.250
If you don't a such then it has to display only dot as a set of files in the given location

23
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.250
.

24
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.090
Right.

25
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.910
Let me go on.

26
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.160
Right.

27
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.740
My strip.

28
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.380
So hats off.

29
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.630
No,

30
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.630
I'm going to open my you next box.

31
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.360
Sanskrit will run even on your we know,

32
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.790
so as well.

33
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.850
Night.

34
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.650
See there.

35
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.540
Let me take some symbols to pass.

36
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.400
Yet Look,

37
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.850
wide extension files don't be white.

38
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.220
See this issue by started?

39
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.850
This is UNIX like systems.

40
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.750
You can also write your shebang line.

41
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.150
So So this is my fight on location.

42
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.330
But don't write this whenever.

43
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.450
If you're running your skipped on your who knows systems it is.

44
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.590
It will work only on your next like systems.

45
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.930
Okay,

46
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.440
now the first thing is our stupid has to read a part.

47
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.610
Parties always history.

48
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.390
We know in Beit on three to read your part,

49
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:44.660
we how let me take user part are required part I'm taking required part right input and

50
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.450
that we were part and very What Indirectly pot.

51
00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:00.020
That's a then After giving your Barrick Lee Pot immediately hard to ask to the user but a

52
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.650
quite extinction Now in that given location,

53
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.970
what are the files you need with what excision you need,

54
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.580
right?

55
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:15.150
That's why enter the required file a file's extension.

56
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.060
Example.

57
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.220
I'm giving not be by or not Shh.

58
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.970
Not log,

59
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.020
maybe anything based on user requirement,

60
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.270
maybe.

61
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.750
Or txt whatever it may be.

62
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.750
That's what I want to read from the user.

63
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.450
Fine.

64
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.540
So first of all,

65
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.020
user is okay as off.

66
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.310
No,

67
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.550
You're going to run this escape.

68
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.550
See the how it is going to work.

69
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.000
Let me take some part.

70
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.840
This has my part.

71
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.380
Suppose Let me come out from here,

72
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.000
then.

73
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.280
I'm going to the north by town skid before going to run let me provide execution

74
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.500
permissions now,

75
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.900
because this Islamic system,

76
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.570
after pouring your permissions after giving your shebang line,

77
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.740
you condone your pipe landscape with the dark slash.

78
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.350
So it is asking Enter your direct report.

79
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.300
Now I'm and bring suppose this one anybody you're required but you can do offer that it is

80
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.150
asking in very well are required extension for your files I am on drinks up was not the way

81
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.850
your script is ending because I know you don't have any logic to find out your extensions.

82
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.720
Your files with the extension only we have a logic to read spot on.

83
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.950
Then do read your extension off a fine.

84
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.350
Fine.

85
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.880
See suppose given part given part by mistake support if user enters a file part.

86
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.360
Right.

87
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.680
See?

88
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.180
Suppose if I take this has apart.

89
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.070
This is definitely part.

90
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.110
Suppose now you fight day support something like Ah,

91
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.250
we don't have anything here.

92
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.970
Yeah,

93
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.150
get required.

94
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.950
This if I do this one right,

95
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.870
These not a territory if it is not a diary right now,

96
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.750
anything inside of that,

97
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.000
right?

98
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.020
So that's why this part is always directory.

99
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.600
So what I want to raise after reading your directory part I'm taking where this is a valued

100
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.680
at report or more so.

101
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.630
It's a good practice,

102
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.060
actually.

103
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.150
Write that lousy.

104
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.250
So before reading your extension,

105
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.050
right,

106
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.440
I can also write my logic off reading extension.

107
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.850
But before reading extension,

108
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.360
I'm writing my la Z.

109
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.080
That is,

110
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.130
if even part is file or directory.

111
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.850
I want to take it.

112
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.870
You know,

113
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.300
in your fight on you have a ways model in that way is model.

114
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.480
We know how.

115
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.320
Where's that part door is file or is there a tree?

116
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.870
So know what I'm drinking?

117
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.610
Use ways dark,

118
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.970
but dot is fight If it is a fine,

119
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.650
I want to stop my script And then I want to say the user,

120
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
please pass only directory part.

121
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.010
Okay,

122
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.390
So,

123
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.780
guys,

124
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.590
this script I'm implementing just Tokyo ideas about your modules on some concepts.

125
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.140
Okay,

126
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.260
you may write the same good in a different way.

127
00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.900
More Barolo.

128
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.350
Fine.

129
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.170
Now what I'm doing is in case if the given part is a file,

130
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.480
then what I want to say to the user Bring the given part.

131
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:22.810
Whatever the user is going to do that given part that but a required But is the file please

132
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.810
,

133
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.950
boss.

134
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.870
Only directory part.

135
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.490
That's it.

136
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.710
I'm closing then Else else Right.

137
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.370
So here,

138
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.250
I need to write my la Z.

139
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.390
So,

140
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.260
for time being,

141
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.610
I would like this also so that he will get some ideas I'm reading here.

142
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.940
Now,

143
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.420
let me remove this part here.

144
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.550
So here,

145
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.900
I need to implement my logic as off.

146
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.150
No,

147
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.570
I'm not implementing will come back and we'll implement.

148
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.150
Okay,

149
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.970
so implement you are actual logic here.

150
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.590
We implement it after some time.

151
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.250
Just wait.

152
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.750
Let me save it.

153
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.050
Right.

154
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.250
So what I'm doing is let me do one thing under you to me.

155
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.230
Let me take some read.

156
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.490
I will do one thing.

157
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.950
Okay,

158
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.170
Come back.

159
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.240
And this is your script,

160
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.650
right?

161
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.400
No,

162
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.150
I'm running that.

163
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.040
So it is asking Enter your directory part,

164
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.830
but suppose just assume that I'm going to give a part called in this location.

165
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.550
I'm going to give some files spot.

166
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.310
Let's say it may be anything since Could be saying that.

167
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.020
See that enter required.

168
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.470
Okay.

169
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.440
Quite a file actions.

170
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.000
Let me and,

171
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.250
uh,

172
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.750
not be way the given pot.

173
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.330
He's a file.

174
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.020
Please pass only directory part.

175
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.280
Suppose if I under if I enter only directory part.

176
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.750
Let me take this one.

177
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.590
No,

178
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.650
you're skipped display.

179
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:13.790
Implement your actual logic when it implement that part night.

180
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.710
No,

181
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.500
See,

182
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.130
one more thing here we are going to implement our logic.

183
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.630
Okay,

184
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.240
first of all,

185
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.090
what I will lose.

186
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.750
I released all the world directories and files in a given location.

187
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.390
De in else block only because in if condition what we're checking.

188
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.160
If it is a file,

189
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.750
then we're displaying this information.

190
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.780
You know,

191
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.750
if this is true,

192
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.140
then you're else Block won't exclude.

193
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.350
If this is false Means you're giving violin directory part.

194
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:45.310
Then they're going to exclude this one right now.

195
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.650
See,

196
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:51.150
what I'm doing is bring seeing the given location.

197
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.250
If you want to list all your directories and files If you remember,

198
00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.210
there is a operation called Ways Door Lister directly.

199
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.670
Then you will require part.

200
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.430
Okay,

201
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.550
let me say we don't own it and see the result.

202
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.050
I'm running and I'm going to provide your part.

203
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.570
Us definitely part.

204
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.090
Okay,

205
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.800
lets embroidered Extension Darby way.

206
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.320
Yes,

207
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.520
in the given location.

208
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.750
You're getting all the files which are there.

209
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.220
But actually what intention?

210
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.450
Ease.

211
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.370
We hardly display wanted Hubble dot the way or dark message,

212
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.060
whatever it may be,

213
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.820
whatever the user user is going to it.

214
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.950
And that's that Extension fighters when he died in to fight.

215
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.660
So no wonder how to do how to take one by one file from here.

216
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.480
And I need to check it.

217
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.760
Whether it is ending with Darby,

218
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.450
we are not,

219
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.490
You know how to take one by one file from the list by using for loop,

220
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.100
you can take it.

221
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.350
But before that,

222
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.750
let me tell you one more thing.

223
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.420
See what?

224
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.850
All the path you're going to wonder if it is empty.

225
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.750
Then why should we check whether files ending with a dot the way our mark.

226
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.440
Right?

227
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.050
So that's why what I'm doing is,

228
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.950
before writing or actual logic,

229
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.600
I'm checking.

230
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.290
I'm taking first,

231
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.720
let me find out all files under it,

232
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.220
Reese.

233
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.750
All files and directories in a given location.

234
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.970
Then after that,

235
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.650
I am reading one motive condition inside of your else that is.

236
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.830
Ive leant off.

237
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.420
You know what is the land function?

238
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.850
It is going to find out number off values in a given list.

239
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.630
You know,

240
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.360
this operation or put is a list of guys now I'm checking.

241
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.850
How many values are there in this by mistake?

242
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.480
If you have a job,

243
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.690
Alice means there are no files under it is in a given location.

244
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.770
So at that time,

245
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.270
I no need to find any logically.

246
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.390
So I'm writing Simply bring the given.

247
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:51.610
The given part is on empty.

248
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.770
But so that part I'm reading here.

249
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.880
What is a given part?

250
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.030
A required part.

251
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.550
That's it.

252
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:05.190
Let me check it.

253
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.210
World is working perfectly or not else else.

254
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.930
Then we hard,

255
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.110
right?

256
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.720
Actual logic.

257
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.310
So then else here I'm going to write,

258
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.150
Bring implement your logic.

259
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.740
So I have No,

260
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.660
we are not implementing.

261
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:18.930
Yes,

262
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.850
we implement it,

263
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.450
right?

264
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.190
Just wait No.

265
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.780
There is a direct recall.

266
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.310
Empty.

267
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.510
I'm taking this empty territory under.

268
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.410
Then let me take this one on also that part.

269
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.030
Then come back then we have our file.

270
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.450
Here,

271
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.650
Let me run it,

272
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.750
Goldman.

273
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.650
One extra parentis.

274
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.450
Let me remove that.

275
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:54.050
See that territory are part I'm going toe in this Remove This parents is That's a night.

276
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.910
Fine.

277
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.750
Now I'm running this one seed output.

278
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.830
Enter a one directory part.

279
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.790
I'm wondering.

280
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:01.950
Suppose you'd any part?

281
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.590
No.

282
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.960
See that.

283
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.620
But okay.

284
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.350
Under the required files extension as well.

285
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.250
Let me enter it.

286
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.090
Implement your logic.

287
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.640
Actually,

288
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.890
this is not an EMP leader,

289
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.550
right?

290
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:21.590
That's why implement your La Z know what I'm doing is I'm going to enter empty dirt Report

291
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.590
.

292
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.990
No,

293
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.720
no.

294
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:24.870
See,

295
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:31.960
the results given part is whatever the part and empty but right.

296
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.650
That's why we need to find out the way files.

297
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:43.490
But if you after your logic clearly let me open it first before checking whether the given

298
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.550
parties empty or not,

299
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.550
you're also reading required file extension.

300
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.560
No,

301
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.920
in guess you forgiven parties an empty pot.

302
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.750
Why should we read this extension case?

303
00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:00.870
That's why now what I'm doing is I'm going to come in the line or I'm going to reveal that

304
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.980
line there on.

305
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.080
I won't write somewhere else where I have,

306
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.450
right?

307
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.500
If you are given parties having some files,

308
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.470
then only I want to read extension right?

309
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:18.540
See if Elsa Block is executing means inside off your else You have one more.

310
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.550
The fells If this else's excluding means you have some list off files in a given location.

311
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.600
Then only I want to read an extension.

312
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.950
Thank you.

313
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.950
No si.

314
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.180
Let me save it and run it on before going to run.

315
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.450
Let me take my part.

316
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.880
This one.

317
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.450
No improving empty pot,

318
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.230
No doubt it is giving given parties and empty.

319
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:50.450
But no if I do some valid but I mean apart which is having some values.

320
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.340
No,

321
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.750
It will also ask anybody what extension?

322
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.610
Like if you're empty part.

323
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:02.190
It is not asking if you did you some part which is having some values,

324
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.930
some files under trees,

325
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.180
then only these asking and terrible extension.

326
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.670
That's good,

327
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.050
actually.

328
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.990
So,

329
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.460
honestly,

330
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.000
we're not going to read extension if you are given parties and empty Fine.

331
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.870
No,

332
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.220
What I'm doing is often leading you an extension.

333
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.480
Our requirement.

334
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.800
These we have to take one by one file from all your files under trees.

335
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.610
So I am begging for each file in your list.

336
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.300
Off ice.

337
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:40.550
Let me first print each fight in a given location.

338
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:48.050
Like let me honey dot slash I'm going to run.

339
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.140
It is asking.

340
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.090
Enter your path.

341
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.190
Let me under my part.

342
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.750
I suppose this one?

343
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.670
Yes.

344
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.960
No,

345
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.850
I'm giving extension as don't be way.

346
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.750
But your script is spending all the files right?

347
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.250
Files under trees.

348
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.410
I don't want to print all the fights which are having which are ending with dark the way

349
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.490
those files only I want to print.

350
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.490
That's why again in or if condition Sorry again in your for loop the harder out of

351
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.550
condition before printing your files.

352
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:25.810
See what I'm doing before printing you are file If if you remember string operation is

353
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.250
there.

354
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.850
That is ends with it.

355
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:36.970
Your party is always your party is always string Now file is a string Barrett Reza String.

356
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:37.220
No,

357
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.150
simply I'm doing.

358
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.890
Is it ending with not really extension.

359
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.530
If it is really ending with did not the way extension then only I want to print.

360
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.990
Otherwise I don't bother aboard that,

361
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.490
right?

362
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.510
No,

363
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.040
let me down.

364
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.450
Your script can see the result now I am giving part as and I'm giving dot Be white.

365
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.360
See that?

366
00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:58.500
What?

367
00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.310
You're getting wounded?

368
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.450
Not be way files.

369
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:08.150
Now let me van us trip once again on let me provide Exceptional Supposed not as such.

370
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.650
See that put Oh my Oh,

371
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.400
the problem is definitely I fix it.

372
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.070
Extension is not the way.

373
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.950
But what about the part extension?

374
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.450
You're reading that variable yard right now.

375
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.250
So actually,

376
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.600
this in this you are storing your extension,

377
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:25.850
right?

378
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.530
No,

379
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.250
it will work.

380
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.290
Let me and Larry were part first.

381
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.050
Let me under daughter such?

382
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.070
Yes,

383
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.150
you're getting only dot essential files.

384
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.570
Let me relearn and provide.

385
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.040
Supposed that B y know,

386
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.550
you're waiting on the dot The way files,

387
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.850
right?

388
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.650
Fine.

389
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.730
If you had a very well script,

390
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.080
your script is displaying individually.

391
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.280
You are required files,

392
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.120
but I don't want to print individually.

393
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.550
I want to print all your dark be way or dot Shh.

394
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.850
As a list,

395
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.550
then how you can do it,

396
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.900
right?

397
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.290
See,

398
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:08.910
guys were nobody.

399
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.710
If you want to create the list based on your required values,

400
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.580
first of all,

401
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.050
you have to define somewhere and empty list.

402
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.300
So after reading your extension,

403
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.950
what I'm doing is I'm defining an empty list.

404
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:33.240
That is that medic Quiet files equals to an empty list instead of printing.

405
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.450
What I'm doing is in inside off your for Luke.

406
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:42.850
I'm opening your each and every you each and every file into in your list.

407
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.580
If you remember,

408
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.720
there is open operation with your list.

409
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.760
The purpose off upper an operation is I think you were given values to your list.

410
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.350
That's her,

411
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.060
right?

412
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.620
One of them After completion,

413
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.600
off your for Luke.

414
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.150
I'm going to print Finally,

415
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.980
the required it.

416
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.280
See the result?

417
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:15.350
The required files are as a list I'm bringing you have pagan required files.

418
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.950
Rt Q Right.

419
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.980
And I didn't miss taking off.

420
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.480
Look,

421
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.900
let me go on Modified That variable name,

422
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.770
as are you Q,

423
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.140
right,

424
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.740
Fine.

425
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.850
But we save it on drink.

426
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.350
I'm running.

427
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:37.220
I'm going to provide a part called Where is my part?

428
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.270
You can take any part,

429
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.520
right?

430
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:38.900
As of now,

431
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.600
I am giving this part and I'm giving dark the way.

432
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.170
Extension.

433
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:43.850
See the result.

434
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.150
Now,

435
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.280
instead of printing your files separately,

436
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.210
you're getting as a list off your required files.

437
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.950
Not only this same script will work for any type of files.

438
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.720
Let me end up and see the result.

439
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.760
I'm wondering suppose dot Shh.

440
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.960
Yes,

441
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.450
Fine.

442
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.130
There's no final concert,

443
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:05.550
please.

444
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.510
I'm giving a path.

445
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.500
Call this one.

446
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:16.950
Suppose I want to get a list off some batch files.

447
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.260
See the result?

448
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:25.640
The required file sore empty list you're getting because there are no empty bad files in my

449
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.630
given this directly see the result here.

450
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.980
We don't know anything which is dining with the dot Bad.

451
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.560
If I don't find any files ending with a dark bad in a given location,

452
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.290
I don't want to put in this way.

453
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.530
I want to print like there are no dot bad files in a given location.

454
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.850
Interpreting an empty I think,

455
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:46.950
is that it's very simple.

456
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:53.340
See that what I'm doing is before printing before printing.

457
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.350
You are required files from this list I'm taking.

458
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:07.430
But that that whether that he's having Gerald Wallace or not let off your required files

459
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.810
secret Easy cause to Jiro.

460
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.900
Then I want to print Bring.

461
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:28.760
There are no What about the extension you're providing that extension files fights in the

462
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.550
location in the location off?

463
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.070
You conveyed your message in any way?

464
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.830
No.

465
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.190
What is?

466
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.800
They are required given part.

467
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.500
This one right?

468
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:51.210
That's it else Else then Only else means not equals to Jeremy's.

469
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.200
There are some files.

470
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.450
No,

471
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.960
I'm bringing that like See that result?

472
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.760
Now I'm going to run You escape.

473
00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.690
Let me copy your part.

474
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.930
I'm giving your part extension.

475
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.450
I'm giving dot Backed.

476
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.020
There are no doubt bad files in the location off.

477
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.050
You are that one.

478
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.390
Let me read on and provide.

479
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.210
Not the way extensions.

480
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.420
Yes,

481
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.350
you are getting life,

482
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.250
but one more just for your decoration purpose time.

483
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.370
I won't write one more line.

484
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:22.950
That is,

485
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.920
if you have some values home.

486
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.220
I mean,

487
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.690
if you're some not the way files how maney files you have in that right?

488
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.180
See?

489
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.920
Nothing is there against what is simple.

490
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:43.520
I'm blending with one more Prince Erdman print There are there are lent off.

491
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.450
You were required files.

492
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.670
That means it is going to give account.

493
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.760
How many valleys are there in that list?

494
00:20:49.760 --> 00:21:04.350
There are in this many number of files in a in the location off require a pot with an

495
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.350
extension off.

496
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:11.050
Whatever that given the extension.

497
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.730
Right,

498
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.700
That is there in this not so fine.

499
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:22.660
I'm They are myself writing that equated files are I can write.

500
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:31.850
So the files are so the files are not Let me say we done done it.

501
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.110
I'm giving a part off this one.

502
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.760
Mostly the music.

503
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.400
Not really,

504
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:46.370
I There are five files in the location off with an extension dark by then.

505
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.660
So the file sore you're getting those five files,

506
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.450
Not only this,

507
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.780
right?

508
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.970
You can provide any part on any file extension automatically now or fight on Skip.

509
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.760
It will fetch them only two files on your getting them.

510
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.990
Right?

511
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:09.520
So there is a simple where to get your required files with your require extension in a

512
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.350
given location.

513
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.890
See,

514
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.320
here maybe concepts are simple,

515
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.300
but the thing is,

516
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.050
you have to understand that why we are taking first defense block.

517
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.240
And why were writing the court only inside off your else.

518
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.920
Block off your festive condition first.

519
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.310
This is our main core Guys,

520
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.570
if you want to understand this school,

521
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.290
you have to understand In this way if you run your core drillings good from top down,

522
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.660
right?

523
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:42.440
You have three lines Main Sorry one do three for file it.

524
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.350
Meaning mainland's in the fight mainland But nobody if you run your script.

525
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:52.450
So by this land your operating system will understand that the remaining court has to run

526
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.070
with help off your pipe on three.

527
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.870
Then you are importing voice.

528
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.330
Then you're really in your path.

529
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:03.190
Then you come under this Don't whatever this line then if ideals so first of all you

530
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.690
understand that if conditions proved this land leg school,

531
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.220
If condition is false,

532
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.950
this entire block is going to execute.

533
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.490
But inside that again,

534
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.490
we have one more condition.

535
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.380
That's a different story.

536
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.890
If given parties a file,

537
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.370
then you're going to exclude this line.

538
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.400
Then you know you.

539
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.160
Then you don't have any lines to execute.

540
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.930
If this is false,

541
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.450
means given parties that a tree,

542
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.900
right?

543
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.050
Then you're going toe eggs.

544
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.240
Good.

545
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.050
These lines right?

546
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:38.480
Then you are finding the number off files under these which are there in a given path.

547
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.660
Right.

548
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:46.030
Then maybe you have some files under this in a given location or you may not have anything

549
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.410
in that.

550
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.760
That's why I'm taking if all files and there it is in a given location.

551
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.420
The number of values,

552
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:59.230
if he caused to Jiro wanted to find the extension finds right.

553
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:04.790
That's why it funnels if number off values I mean number of files and artist R equals zero

554
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:04.790
.

555
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.870
Then you are printing this one.

556
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.850
Then your script is over.

557
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.590
If it is not because of Jeremy,

558
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.050
there are something maybe file Solidarity's are both No problem.

559
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.140
So if there are something,

560
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.820
then only I want to read Extension?

561
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.050
Yes,

562
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:16.760
I'm reading back.

563
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.330
Right.

564
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.920
So they say,

565
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.710
Just available.

566
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.050
You're defending an empty list.

567
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.010
Then you're going to get some number off files.

568
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.770
And there it is in this,

569
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:27.050
right?

570
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:27.820
No,

571
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.710
My intention is I want to take one by one,

572
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.870
and then I want to check whether this is ending with you were require extension or not.

573
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.750
If it is ending with the required extension,

574
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.020
then I'm storing that value into this list.

575
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.710
You know,

576
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.130
in list.

577
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:44.460
You can store any number off values right after completion of your for.

578
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.450
Look what I'm doing,

579
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.790
right.

580
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.850
If lent off your required files,

581
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.950
what are the files you're finding?

582
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.540
If it is acquitted,

583
00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:54.720
you know,

584
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.160
means there are no dark the way our daughter such whatever it may be your extension.

585
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.460
We did that extension.

586
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.660
You don't know any files.

587
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.050
That's why I'm bringing this information.

588
00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.690
Else Means you have some files.

589
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.490
Then I'm bringing that.

590
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.550
How many files are there?

591
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.850
What are those?

592
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.310
Nothing encased in this anti program.

593
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.700
If you provide valid part,

594
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.480
then a little work.

595
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.050
Suppose if you render an invalid part.

596
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:19.910
See that?

597
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:20.590
First of all,

598
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.770
I'm wondering.

599
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.010
Know about us.

600
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:30.660
Something see that?

601
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.450
No such file or directory,

602
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.280
right?

603
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.920
That's why you have to provide valued file in case if you provide were invalid filer

604
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.730
invaluable part.

605
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:43.950
Then how to take care?

606
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.120
We will see that.

607
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.340
Well,

608
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.870
going forward as off.

609
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.650
No way learning this clip your toe provide valid part Only it may be directly part or file

610
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:52.950
parts.

611
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.210
If you probably file part,

612
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.200
then your script will stop on says that this is a fight part.

613
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.700
Please pause only directly part if you provide value,

614
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.660
that report and we'll work on your given path.

615
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.160
Right.

616
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.810
So if you provide any invalid part how 200.

617
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.300
We will see that while going forward.

618
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.350
I don't want to confuse you in a single area with all those concepts.

619
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.450
Right?

620
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.230
Fine.

621
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.800
OK,

622
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.100
guys,

623
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.300
Thank you for watching this video.
