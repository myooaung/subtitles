00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
difference in this video.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.800
We're going to see the different types off editors to write your python core,

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.050
right?

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.280
Let me start there.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.030
We are different types off readers like,

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.870
ideally,

7
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.350
we A or we emitters not part are not perplex place by charms by the tidal sublime text year

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.250
tell'em and so many.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.050
Right,

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.050
So it's here among all U R V i or V a embroider.

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.290
It is the common link areata on remaining All are idealists.

12
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm in the Manola.

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.210
Do you areas like so this as an automation unit,

14
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.100
Right?

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.820
First of all,

16
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.510
you should be good with how to use either veet or we emeritus and you know,

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.560
by default,

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.390
right you won't get We are via maters on the war windows,

19
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.060
but anyway,

20
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.150
you'll get by default This a v a r were married us on your UNIX like systems,

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.180
right?

22
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.460
So I'm going to provide the link to install V.

23
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.580
I am on your Windows operating system on the bill off this video.

24
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.070
We just to go through that so that you can able to install V a murder for your Windows

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.120
operating systems right on anyway to install wi I am on your UNIX like systems.

26
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.490
Because by tea party will get v A Are on some,

27
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.740
like open door opening systems.

28
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.430
You will also get William right in.

29
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.050
Guess if you want to install Suppose on Lennox you r V am simply young install,

30
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.320
right?

31
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.220
You mean stone?

32
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.890
We am.

33
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.390
That's it.

34
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.950
Very simple,

35
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.400
right?

36
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.070
So based on ur UNIX like systems,

37
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.280
you have to run your command to install the AM anybody for you're going to get we ate.

38
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.950
That's fine.

39
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.650
No.

40
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.580
What is this ideal?

41
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.250
So they ideally means integrated development,

42
00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.620
and Iran meant so he wants If he install your python on your windows operating systems by

43
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.810
before this idea,

44
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.750
we will be in store.

45
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.300
Just go to your stock after installing your python and see that there is a ideally called

46
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.350
by phone three years on 64 bit.

47
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.870
Right?

48
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.950
If you open that,

49
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.900
just go under.

50
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.070
So it is going toe weapon,

51
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.860
a python shell or bite uncommon line like so I'm going to start it very first time.

52
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.850
It will take some time,

53
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.890
so just wait.

54
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.810
It's opening.

55
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.550
You'll see here.

56
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.520
So these bite on shell gays Not only here,

57
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.070
if you open simply were window sternal on their If we enter,

58
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.030
simply piped on You are entering into your python,

59
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.250
colonel or potential or fight uncommonly.

60
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
Both are same.

61
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.490
So this is dif bite.

62
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.250
If all you're getting some fight on shell command line by opening your ideal eternal are

63
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.760
from your windows offering to stop me for type simply by item.

64
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.960
You are.

65
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.360
And bring into this one not only here,

66
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.860
even on your in expect system also from Cameron Line.

67
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.400
If you enter,

68
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.010
fight on,

69
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.450
then you will enter into your fight on shell or bite uncommonly.

70
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.450
So what is the purpose of this?

71
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.550
Nothing used their days.

72
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.750
Uh,

73
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.450
if you have a fight on program which consists off,

74
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.080
suppose some hundreds off lines,

75
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.990
maybe two lines also are maybe one line also each and every line individually,

76
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.920
you can exclude here one by one.

77
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.130
Okay,

78
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.010
that is about yourself.

79
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.440
Your by,

80
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.740
don't shell Now these aren't this one both darshan right now from here.

81
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.910
If you open simply if you take on file on click on new file,

82
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.590
it is going to create the editor like you're not so here.

83
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.030
He conveyed your python program and you can save it.

84
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:13.250
Let me write simply something called Fight on three dot Exe Let me say this accomplice.

85
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.670
So you have to say of somewhere I'm going to say we don't mind.

86
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.650
They stop simply the more not the way,

87
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.950
and then go to run.

88
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.550
Then one morning a lot that we can use the FAA also in your keyboard.

89
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.980
So this result you're getting on your work by torrential.

90
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.490
This is one way.

91
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.490
Or suppose if he how Evil v a mater from common line.

92
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.800
Also,

93
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.380
you can buy the fight on program like we am,

94
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.000
right?

95
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.490
Them or not,

96
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.490
B y right.

97
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.230
I'm opening that they would not be way file on there.

98
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.090
I'm going to write my python programs already.

99
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.950
Is there somewhere?

100
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.250
So three lines off court is there.

101
00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.890
So let me run this so simply to run your fight on programs,

102
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.250
fight on space,

103
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.730
you're demoted or TV not to.

104
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.150
So if you have there,

105
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150
I'm having three lines off court here.

106
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.900
Not these three lines off court.

107
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.040
I can run from my potential as well.

108
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.010
Let me take first line and copy and paste it on.

109
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.530
Excluded?

110
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.770
Yes,

111
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.700
you're getting or put no liquid egg.

112
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.680
Second line so initially,

113
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.750
in case if you want to practice line by line,

114
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.620
you can go on a weapon,

115
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.910
this potential and you can practice your core,

116
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.300
right?

117
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.640
So,

118
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.880
guys,

119
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.860
you can go with your ideally And from there you can go with the file on.

120
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.150
You can create a new fight,

121
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.340
Not this right.

122
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.450
You have this one bite on shell,

123
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.740
take your new file and it's like a note by,

124
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.290
But you can ride your program,

125
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.950
you can save it and you can done simply by pressing if I or by clicking on one model if I

126
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.050
one model.

127
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.610
Right?

128
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.550
So go,

129
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.770
guys,

130
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.820
My station is no need to use this one.

131
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.490
Don't use.

132
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.970
Ideally,

133
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.330
if you want,

134
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.830
you can use it.

135
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.950
But instead of that from your windows are planets orbiting system command line right,

136
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.120
creative file.

137
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.420
Just use were or were Meridor's are to enter in your potential.

138
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.010
Just type on your windows or UNIX like systems.

139
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.140
Simply python and you'll enter into your pipe on shell and there you can exclude your line

140
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.500
by line.

141
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.850
All right,

142
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.150
fine.

143
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.840
So they know we are working with Ideally,

144
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.880
we are William.

145
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.260
Anyway,

146
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.950
by tearfully how note Part or no pair place place.

147
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.840
You can write your program on the sale.

148
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.500
Your python program with an extinction off dot B Y on.

149
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.290
You can run your program by entering into your come online on bypassing fight on space

150
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.850
program Lee.

151
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.950
Anyway,

152
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.000
this is not so instability.

153
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.640
Right Then you can also use by tome,

154
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.240
Right?

155
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.250
Are spider are Prideaux atrium and sublime text.

156
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.670
Right.

157
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.650
So frustrating days Remember that as an order commissioning in it,

158
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.350
you should be good with either we a are we emitters,

159
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.430
Andi?

160
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.190
Because they're from command line.

161
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.710
Right then.

162
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.900
Second thing,

163
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.250
if you want to use it and use ideally as a guowei Rita But instead of that way practising

164
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.210
because in your real time you may or may not how this by charm or anyone off this do

165
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.350
waiters Definitely on or purposeless night.

166
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.750
But anyway,

167
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.910
in your real time,

168
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:31.150
right?

169
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.970
The is the johns to how as a NATO,

170
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.870
you know what real time on that.

171
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.650
So I just tried to you This were we am in case for your practice,

172
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.580
right?

173
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.450
You can use either by Tom or sublime text.

174
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.710
So in the next video,

175
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:55.010
I will show you how to install either by Tom are sublime text Right on for these guys.

176
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.250
If you want to use we a m editor on your Windows operating system by default,

177
00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.940
you don't have.

178
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.540
So I'm going to push the length to install VM on your Windows operating system.

179
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.410
You just go through that link so that you can able to install where we am on your Windows

180
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.050
operating system.

181
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.850
Right?

182
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.680
