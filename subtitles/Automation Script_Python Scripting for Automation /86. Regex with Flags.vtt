ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
friends here.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.100
We're going to work with python.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.850
Regular expressions with the flags.

4
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.500
See,

5
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.080
already we have seen the rules to create Your patterns aren't These are the rules which we

6
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.350
saw to create your patterns.

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.440
Right now we're going to work with your regular expressions with the flags as well.

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.850
So these are the available flags for your pipe down Regular expressions.

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.920
See,

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.450
these are the flags you can use a the shortcut or this flag name,

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.650
but oh,

12
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.720
seem now among all those as off.

13
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.080
No,

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.250
I'm going to work and I'm going to show you with ari dot i n r e not him.

15
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Later we will work with the remaining as well.

16
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950
No.

17
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.650
First off a lorry dot I are already not ignore case you Can you say that the shortcut or

18
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.040
this full inte flag?

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.660
Make that regular expression case incense to So let me open my later toe.

20
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.290
Get clarity on this I'm writing a simple script.

21
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.950
Imports are immortal.

22
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.550
Let me take some X equals two.

23
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.260
This is a string Commemorating Be hedge.

24
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.230
I yes is a new strain something like that.

25
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.400
Then I'm reading simply all our capitals No,

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.650
See that my requirement is I need to find all the strings with this.

27
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.950
This is strings I need to find.

28
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.590
Suppose if I take a pattern as in this way,

29
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.400
My pattern eyes frosting I'm taking.

30
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.680
But there is a good practice.

31
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.150
We just try to take our before writing your pattern.

32
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.820
Let me bring Tory.

33
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.720
Don't find all with your partner on any given text.

34
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.950
What is the result you're getting?

35
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.390
What happened?

36
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.410
So we find all we're getting this.

37
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.600
But if you don't kinds of case sensitivity,

38
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.750
then they see that this on dsi that you how this year and here and here.

39
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.570
But I am looking for small details.

40
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.570
But there are combination with smaller capital.

41
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.050
And these are completely capital.

42
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.810
No,

43
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.020
I don't want to look for case sensitivity,

44
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.740
then just include a flag called corridor.

45
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.080
I I'll see that is a so here.

46
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.150
I included a flag so you can use either ari dot I short cut off your flag or ignored case.

47
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.440
That is also same.

48
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.870
See that.

49
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.150
Let me read and understood output.

50
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930
So just use a shotgun.

51
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.570
That's better.

52
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.750
That's it.

53
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.270
So this is a use off your ignore case,

54
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.240
since the with the flag.

55
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.070
Then we are next thing already.

56
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.460
Door.

57
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.450
Um might be late.

58
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.770
See that?

59
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.400
First of all,

60
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.450
let me take some multi line fixed.

61
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.890
Let me take my extras.

62
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.960
So,

63
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.160
guys,

64
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.090
this is useful.

65
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.490
I mean,

66
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.550
this option already,

67
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.490
Dottie Emmys useful.

68
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.400
Whenever If you're going toe,

69
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.060
work with fights using your file object or read operation and you will see that example as

70
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.250
well.

71
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.050
First,

72
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.850
let me write some string with multiple lines.

73
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.460
So this is a string on.

74
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.540
This is a second line.

75
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.850
Something like that I'm writing.

76
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.390
This is a supposed shoreline on this.

77
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.240
So if he held a string in this way,

78
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.750
first of all,

79
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.690
these a multi line string against print consider result.

80
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.130
So you're getting or put in multi lines.

81
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.830
So we are giving in terms off triple condition.

82
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.400
He was trained.

83
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.090
That means that is in my D line string.

84
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.350
No,

85
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.450
What I'm doing is I am writing a pattern just to find this.

86
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:06.430
Bring body dot Find all from your pattern in the given model.

87
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.020
Inpex,

88
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.650
see the result?

89
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.970
Let me come in this,

90
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.240
uh,

91
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.150
printed text.

92
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.700
Mostly the result.

93
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.660
Wherever this is there,

94
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.450
you're getting that.

95
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.830
Okay,

96
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.260
Anyway,

97
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.900
I'm looking as off.

98
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.320
No support.

99
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.960
Small if he had.

100
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.220
So yes,

101
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.700
a string.

102
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.290
Yes,

103
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.950
you are getting there.

104
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.350
No,

105
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.020
I want to bring if this is the very first inning given strength them.

106
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.970
I can take caps.

107
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.480
Immolate.

108
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.430
See,

109
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.070
that is a this Yes in very first let me have it.

110
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.940
This our very first.

111
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.940
You're getting that this.

112
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.210
Then what about these two?

113
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.730
81 and 9 20 Harvest this string,

114
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.050
right?

115
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.760
See,

116
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.250
if you remember from our previous rules character start off the string on start off the

117
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.950
line in gets off multilane.

118
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.020
So by the four Caret will look only in the first line if you have all my deadlines.

119
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.490
But we held mighty lines and multi lanes.

120
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.250
We have this.

121
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.330
If you want to look in each and every line by default,

122
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.830
Carrot won't look by the four.

123
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.510
Caret will look only in the first line.

124
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.350
But I want to look it looking each and every line.

125
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.400
Then you need to are a flag call Ari daughter young or already dark multilane.

126
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.560
No.

127
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.650
See that in two places that very first we have this in two lines.

128
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.470
So looking all the lines looking all multi lines.

129
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.160
You are regular expression pattern.

130
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.550
There is the use off radar.

131
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.050
Yum.

132
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.570
Now,

133
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.780
along with your Ari Dottie,

134
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.030
um,

135
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.990
I want to ignore case in studio as well,

136
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.890
because I need to look for this.

137
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.990
Ph tells.

138
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.130
I mean 99.

139
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.750
This also captivity had two years.

140
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.850
Then you have to include your case.

141
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.100
Since you d flag as well,

142
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.070
then you have to use pipeline on.

143
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.200
Then you can use already dot I So if you want to work with my tea flags yard include all

144
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.950
facts with the pipelines symbol,

145
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.580
right.

146
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.250
That's it.

147
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.350
The same way you can look for ending words as well.

148
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.390
See,

149
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.940
let me come.

150
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.240
And this Let me right here.

151
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.860
Suppose this liberates on muting and in the U.

152
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.930
S.

153
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.850
Support I'm going toe in writing the end.

154
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.770
No,

155
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.550
my requirement days I want Oh,

156
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.150
bring the end,

157
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.300
effendi,

158
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.550
is there are the ending in a given next or string?

159
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.550
So Pattani's you know,

160
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:38.490
simply and ending your looking dollar mostly the result and end the or getting why you're

161
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.600
getting I included your already Dottie Um let me remove their No see that you're not

162
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.510
getting end in the I mean the multi lines you're going to get only in the one line.

163
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.060
Sorry.

164
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.410
Ending,

165
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.760
ending.

166
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.460
Not about this.

167
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.420
This is aboard this.

168
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.220
See the result End off the string.

169
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.340
So in end of the string,

170
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.530
we have only ended here.

171
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.890
But in each and every lane.

172
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.180
If you want to look for you are required string.

173
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.430
Is there at the ending or not?

174
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.320
Then unit in global multi line.

175
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.750
That's right.

176
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.120
At the same time,

177
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.750
if you want include case sensitivity.

178
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.890
Let me read here.

179
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.370
Capital,

180
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.690
Yandy or capital E N d.

181
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.750
That's it.

182
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.550
Okay,

183
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.000
so you guys,

184
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.240
you can get clarity.

185
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.690
Suppose if I take here and I'm removing this multi line.

186
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.650
You can keep your case and study if you want.

187
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.820
First let me anymore multilane and see the result you're getting only last year.

188
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.900
Because dollar means in the entire string.

189
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.220
Only last line.

190
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.930
Carrot means first line.

191
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.750
Starting end means last line ending word.

192
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.720
Where did marty lines are?

193
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.560
How we end?

194
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.790
I need to find that as well then,

195
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.850
Ari Door.

196
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.040
Um,

197
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.350
anything include ari dot Yemen If you remortgage or why it won't work because these are

198
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.700
some combination with capital and small somebody For eight years,

199
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.990
Molly And now it is going to fetch that because include,

200
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.710

201
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.800
But to include this end on this end unit to write case since duty as well,

202
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.050
that's a Nazi laser.

203
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.150
Okay,

204
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.870

205
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.510
