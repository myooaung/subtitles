00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
prince here.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.650
We're going to discuss about variable or variables,

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.730
and we're going to see what is variable,

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.850
how to declare a variable and use on displaying a variable value using print.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.970
Three.

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.070
Declare a variable on how to deal it available,

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.610
and finally,

8
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.650
we're going to see rules to define a variable.

9
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.150
Let me start with the 1st 1 that is what is variable.

10
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.200
So before going toe,

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.190
enter with your pipe on variable.

12
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.440
Let me explain your known thing that is in your mathematics.

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.520
Suppose if you write X equals two and then some weigh close to three.

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.360
Express to what you are doing.

15
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.820
Any number three or 45 What ordered?

16
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.480
Maybe so if executed to what is way value.

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.500
Then you are saying what it cost to three into.

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.110
266 plus 4 10 Right?

19
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.240
No year X is a variable.

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.150
Why is available?

21
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.550
So you are assigning to two X and finally you're getting way value as 10 off simply 10

22
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.140
assigned to wait.

23
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.120
Now you can say finally,

24
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.200
after completion of visit,

25
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.520
the question you consist simply X values to Andre.

26
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.300
Value is 10 right now.

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.230
Here were saying that X and Y er,

28
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.310
variables.

29
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.320
Same meaning in your mathematics also right.

30
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.790
But here in your mathematics,

31
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.440
simply you are assigning to two X,

32
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.740
and you are saying execution toe on paper.

33
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.710
But here,

34
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.300
whenever.

35
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.770
If you define execution to in your fight on program or scrape,

36
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.380
what will happen means your pie tenable.

37
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.310
Assigned some memory location for your ex on in that memory location,

38
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.210
the value will be stored and whenever.

39
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.870
If you want to access this value,

40
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.660
always,

41
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.750
you have to use the X.

42
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.350
That's a right.

43
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.480
So when we go,

44
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.070
it's simple,

45
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.680
meaningful.

46
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.550
We were variable.

47
00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.610
So available is nothing but a resort memory location to store values our value.

48
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.730
So whenever,

49
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.660
if you want to go do some action right on your variable.

50
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.920
Yes,

51
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.280
you can do it by taking that variable value right?

52
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.490
How to take on how to use.

53
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.960
We will see then how to declare and user variable.

54
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.690
No need to declare a variable before using them.

55
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.080
That means suppose guys I want to store expel us to in my python program,

56
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.930
but I want to store whatever legal some for dirt fight.

57
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.080
Now,

58
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.280
if after year exes in teacher and why is afloat point So before going to assign 23 x our

59
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.120
food our way to why you need to tell your fight and I'm going to take excess and diesel in

60
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.050
techs are way as indigent floor way.

61
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.870
You know,

62
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.330
Nieto,

63
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.380
tell this information to your python python will automatically identify which type of data

64
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.140
you are storing into your ex on.

65
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.750
That's why a fight on his core dynamically type language.

66
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.350
Okay,

67
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.150
No,

68
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.150
let me show you this on your common line or maybe through program through script Horan are

69
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.710
using your fight uncommonly.

70
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.180
Right?

71
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.620
So what do you want to be?

72
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.220
Just weapon.

73
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.730
Some editor case.

74
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.920
You can use either common linear their source.

75
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.550
If you have some,

76
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.270
do a test,

77
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.150
you can also use that,

78
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.150
right?

79
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.450
They write some line as a a close to some 10.

80
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.260
Right?

81
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.470
And if you want to print your a value,

82
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.950
you have to write plenty so that the value off year will be bring.

83
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.860
And already we have seen bite.

84
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.160
If you want to print a string using Prince statement,

85
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.230
you're writing print parentheses inside of corrections,

86
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.790
some string.

87
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.670
But whenever if you are printing of variable value,

88
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.870
don't use conditions.

89
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.790
If use conditions.

90
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.650
It will be print as thirties.

91
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.650
I mean,

92
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.660
let me do one thing.

93
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.250
I'm going to open my common line.

94
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.850
Okay?

95
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.610
No,

96
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.400
I am on bringing to my pipe internal.

97
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.000
So,

98
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.190
guys,

99
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.990
whatever the line,

100
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.350
I'm typing here the same lines you can write in your program as well.

101
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.860
Let's say I'm writing X equal to some four member Now these very first on your program.

102
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.950
Next time I'm writing print Exe Now you can see the result,

103
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.450
but different Bring quotations eggs.

104
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.630
It will print as it is.

105
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.650
I mean X will be print as ladies.

106
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.220
So if we x is a variable you how to print?

107
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.420
We told quotations for your variable If it is not the variable And if you want to feel that

108
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.700
as a string itself right,

109
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.930
you can print in this way also,

110
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.020
if you print in this way,

111
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.220
you will get only X,

112
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.250
not the X value.

113
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.570
First of all,

114
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.610
if you print in this way,

115
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.150
there is no relationship between your ex and this quotation sex because this is a string

116
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.210
and this is our variable,

117
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.280
right?

118
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.850
See if I bring simply Hello,

119
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:57.590
It is printing your string as it is because you are providing your message off string or

120
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.780
text inside of quotations.

121
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.250
That's why your print will print as Adi's.

122
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.750
Right.

123
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.180
Fine.

124
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.350
Now let me take Why?

125
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.980
Because of some number five or six.

126
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.450
Now I am point to print by value.

127
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.260
Yes,

128
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.890
you are getting and to see that I want to know the type off your ex and white paper fix in

129
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.450
Teacher,

130
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.170
bring same lanes weakened by the all lines in the program and you can exclude race.

131
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.750
Why float,

132
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.280
right?

133
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.440
Let me weapon any there.

134
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.640
So I'm going to use here.

135
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.490
Sublime text.

136
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.650
Of course you can use we am or bite home,

137
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.960
right?

138
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.260
What?

139
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.840
Our idea.

140
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:51.190
You are prefer like so Now let me use so blame.

141
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.850
Next.

142
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.740
Sorry.

143
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.220
Yeah,

144
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.350
So blamed text.

145
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.210
So I'm going to open sublime texts now using that sublime text.

146
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.850
What are the lines you excluded on your python terminal?

147
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.050
Python shell bite uncommon line.

148
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.100
Same lines.

149
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.250
I am going to execute.

150
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.680
Right?

151
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.750
Let me copy line by line and let me paste it here somewhere.

152
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.000
So I'm going to save these ass.

153
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.750
That means sale first on my program.

154
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.450
Okay,

155
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.470
let me go to the store Because there.

156
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.420
We have some direct record python scripts,

157
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.650
so I'm going to ready here,

158
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.090
working with variable start people.

159
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.840
Any programme,

160
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.960
namely hard to take like so,

161
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.230
actually,

162
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.490
Costa Ford is the first line.

163
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.250
You then on your terminal,

164
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.990
then print.

165
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.450
Exe.

166
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.150
That's it.

167
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.130
No,

168
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.650
Save it on Ronnie to run your program from It was script from Sublime takes a hard to run

169
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.550
control plus B.

170
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.850
You can see the output.

171
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.560
So you know that one day with by using geo agencies,

172
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.970
you can see your program here itself on all sort.

173
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.720
Put right Then let me take one more thing called print.

174
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.450
Exe So there's a heart to know the difference between command line and your bite on program

175
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.450
.

176
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.670
So command land,

177
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.980
water boarding You are excluding line by line by typing your required line program your

178
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.250
wind eggs Good all lines one by one with your fight on.

179
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.140
Let's say why he chose to fight our six.

180
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.940
I'm going to declare way value like don't provide any spaces before starting your line.

181
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.010
If you provide,

182
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.180
it will give an indentation.

183
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.520
No,

184
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.250
let me print your way.

185
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.450
Then let me print.

186
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.430
You're type off X on.

187
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.040
Let me print.

188
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.030
They were type off way as well right now,

189
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.650
I say,

190
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.520
And I'm going to run guys whenever.

191
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.950
If it on your part on program,

192
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.650
it will run from up to down.

193
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.730
It will take first line.

194
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.250
X equals two.

195
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.000
For there is no Prince statement,

196
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
you won't get any output.

197
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.170
Simply four value is assigned to the X Now after first line in your remaining program,

198
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.250
X Value is four.

199
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.010
No,

200
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.370
because off second Land it will print exe X value,

201
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.330
not x X elements for darling.

202
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:29.090
It will print excesses because you're writing exercises String even 14 hello will be

203
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.790
displayed because our 50 lane where he was fighters six.

204
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.230
Now print way,

205
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.560
way Well,

206
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.260
it will be print.

207
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.090
I perfects What type of better you're storing in three X on what type of?

208
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.390
But they are starting in the way that type of data will be displayed because off last to

209
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.450
prince treatments.

210
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.980
And if you observed output final or port,

211
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.880
you're getting indigent and float lost to print statement after their because off this bite

212
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.150
on his core dynamically type language,

213
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.740
right?

214
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.840
So that's if you want to defend any variable yard right?

215
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.250
Simply executes 24 our way cause some number,

216
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.150
right?

217
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.350
Fine.

218
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.430
No.

219
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.950
Next thing is re declare a variable.

220
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:09.960
See that?

221
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.220
Very first on Mexico,

222
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.340
so full right now.

223
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.720
What I'm doing is in nine plane I'm writing executes some 23 on If I print intently next

224
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.950
value you modified your X value from 4 to 23.

225
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:28.450
So that would put last to Prince statement 23 or getting so even while re declaring your

226
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.070
variable.

227
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.280
You no need to tell you your fight and I'm going to change my ex value and so on,

228
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.790
so line.

229
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.310
I know.

230
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.550
But if you want to feel to change your variable value,

231
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.380
you're alone at it.

232
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.440
You can change your ex Well,

233
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.950
you right in this way.

234
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.620
Some was very first when I different then then after some lines are modifying x value.

235
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:46.920
Yes,

236
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.510
you are alone.

237
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.250
Right?

238
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.050
Then the little variable.

239
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.800
See?

240
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.700
First of all,

241
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.040
why we need to deliver variable value on that many of them Just a junior days.

242
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.850
You're having some intelligence off lines off program,

243
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.850
right?

244
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.450
So a gym days out of 500 lines on these are the 500 lines.

245
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.450
Somewhere here you defend some variable where you call X equals something.

246
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.480
Do you know that after 500 lines,

247
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.050
I mean from fine art 1 2000 lines.

248
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.890
So here you are Know where you are using your X variable value,

249
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.830
right?

250
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.650
But what number if you run your python program,

251
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.720
whatever the variables you are defining on whatever the operations you're performing,

252
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.250
all those things will be performed from RAM memory.

253
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.190
Right.

254
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:40.130
So you feel if you are not going to use here your exploitable value Why should we keep that

255
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.120
in my program?

256
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.120
Why should we keep that in DRAM memory?

257
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.530
Honestly,

258
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.900
I'm going to waste my time Memory right.

259
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.090
You can delete.

260
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.030
You can free up your ram memory by deleting your very well value.

261
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.830
If you are not using that right,

262
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.950
simply little X.

263
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:02.890
See that after 10 plain Know that I'm using variable collects then in Lebanon and what I

264
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:03.780
will do simply,

265
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.220
I will deal itics in case after deleting.

266
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.950
If you try toe print your X value.

267
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.550
There is no more X.

268
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.310
You will get an Arab name.

269
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:17.450
X is not defined because by this land your fight on is removing from his history.

270
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.410
Your ex now there is no X in your python,

271
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.360
right?

272
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.350
That's why are getting another.

273
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.930
So if you are not using that,

274
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.800
only our ability,

275
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.170
Right?

276
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.280
So simply remember,

277
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.590
how did they let a variable value simply deal it x fine.

278
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.490
Now,

279
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.710
the next thing is rules to define a variable names.

280
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.870
So as of no guys,

281
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.280
we have taken variable names as,

282
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.260
like Exxon Dwight.

283
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.620
But in the all time you might take suppose you're going to find job awash in the injury of

284
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.160
excellent way,

285
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.550
I will take a variable called Job.

286
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.020
Abortion equals toe something.

287
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.820
I write some logic to find my job.

288
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.250
Abortion,

289
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.740
Right.

290
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.470
So likewise,

291
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.170
you can take some variable names known intraday like X and white support.

292
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.690
I'm going to install some java,

293
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.360
right,

294
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.750
So install package.

295
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.650
I will take simply Joe up.

296
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:14.390
So this is my variable name Java watching is my variable name They so?

297
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.150
No.

298
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.920
While selecting your variable names,

299
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.350
you have to follow some rules,

300
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.140
right?

301
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.650
Let me go.

302
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.710
That rules one by one.

303
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.390
It contains the letters numbers and underscore.

304
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.390
So whatever the variable name you're selecting,

305
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.850
it may be simply xtrajet or pick you right.

306
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.100
But also,

307
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.760
you can take some Lenti variable names while taking lengthy variable names.

308
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.650
You are variable name should include only this group off.

309
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:45.350
Not include it may contain either letters or numbers on Underscore.

310
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.520
Don't take anything other than from these three groups.

311
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.250
Suppose dollar is not there in our three,

312
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.810
either in this or in this or in this.

313
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.060
So don't take dollar in your variable name support.

314
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.810
I want to define X Y X Y equals some number 10.

315
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:01.350
It's fine,

316
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.870
but x dollar.

317
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.150
Our dollar X don't take in that way.

318
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.590
Dollar X R X dollars.

319
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.570
They are invalid.

320
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.070
Variable names Don't take them right then,

321
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.450
2nd 1 it should not a keyword.

322
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.650
See,

323
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.580
Actually,

324
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.050
if you take simply,

325
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.350
you've right.

326
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:28.310
It is a valid variable name on the based on You were three groups because it's containing

327
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.490
only letters right?

328
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.540
But the thing is,

329
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.750
if he's already pre defined world for your piped onto do some popular action,

330
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.350
that's why.

331
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:44.390
Don't take pre defined words as your variable names like Bring You know what is the purpose

332
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:44.390
?

333
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.950
Offering trendy used to print something and don't take Bring us up with some variable limb

334
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:49.950
.

335
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.250
Let me day print because some number 40 don't take print as they were.

336
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.750
Very blame because print is already pre defined world for your python,

337
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.750
right?

338
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:04.750
So they see no need to mug up about your pre defined words are keywords while practicing,

339
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.590
you will come to know right after completion of your complete bite on you will come to know

340
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:17.100
which are the key words right then can't contain a space You should not include a space in

341
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.080
your variable name.

342
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.550
Let's say ah at me.

343
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.810
Take command line.

344
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.950
Anything is final.

345
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:29.610
I am taking my name cause suppose not in the so my name.

346
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.750
My variable name contains a space that is invalid,

347
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.400
right?

348
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:42.090
So don't take any spaces in your variable names then it should not start with the number.

349
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.700
Yeah,

350
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:49.800
One more thing guys don't take Don't take space in your variable name whenever If you want

351
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:56.610
to feel to take a space in gym space just to club those two in this way my name Now it is

352
00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:57.320
like tours,

353
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.040
but we're clubbing these two words with underscore right So underscored is allowed in our

354
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.450
variable name right from here underscored is allowed.

355
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:14.480
So that's why I can take simply my name are my value,

356
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.350
my number Anything you can No problem.

357
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.750
OK,

358
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:25.460
so the number If you want to take a space inside of your variable just replace that space

359
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.150
with underscore then fine.

360
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.750
Next one needs It should not start with the number.

361
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.080
Suppose guys,

362
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.750
you can idexx one equals to some number on the x two week or two Some one more number,

363
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.540
right?

364
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.250
And if you print it simply x one.

365
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:46.850
And if you print simply XTO it's working perfectly But if you take one X,

366
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.550
that is invalid Variable name.

367
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.650
So don't start.

368
00:15:50.650 --> 00:16:00.650
You are variable name with the number right on it is a kid since two que since two means

369
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.700
small x equals to four on the Catholics is some different way will let me print both small

370
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.050
X on Catholics because they're different.

371
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.620
Okay,

372
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.890
since two means small X and Catholic,

373
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.600
their different.

374
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.480
You can use small excess.

375
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.080
One variable on the Catholics has one more variable.

376
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.650
Okay.

377
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.750
And the last one is guys saw.

378
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.050
You should not start with the number,

379
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.250
right,

380
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:33.860
But in your valued for your valid variable names you got is these three groups of letters

381
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.560
numbers and underscore you can also start.

382
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.200
You are very able with underscore.

383
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.090
Let's say underscored executes some number.

384
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.970
It is a valid,

385
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.260
but don't start with the number.

386
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.910
Okay.

387
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.240
So,

388
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.470
guys,

389
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.650
these are the important points to remember while defending a variable names are while

390
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.650
selecting a variable name whenever.

391
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.500
If you're writing your python scripts like,

392
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.990
Look,

393
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.370
you guys,

394
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.760
thank you for watching this video.
