1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
preference here.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,120
We're going to discuss a boat.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,530
Data structures off.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,050
Right on.

5
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,950
So before entering into this concept,

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,320
right already,

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,330
we know what is a variable in python,

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,130
right?

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,060
So variables are used to store some data.

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,350
Even data structures are also variables,

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,360
and they are used to store in data.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,950
But that data is collection off data.

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,950
Let me explain that you are on my common line,

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,250
So let me enter into my pipe down.

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,080
So you know,

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,450
normal variables like X equals toe fight.

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,670
Then I can say the value off axis fire,

18
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,140
and I can see with help off print off eggs night now.

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,150
Sometimes,

20
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,430
you know,

21
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,670
you need to define number off variables instead of defending number off variables.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,090
What I will do is I would take only one variable.

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,560
Let's say my values.

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,540
You can take like your X rays that also your variable name,

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:18,760
but I'm taking my values equals two like you can take any type of data you can a present

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,030
evil data inside off.

27
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,660
Suppose your square brackets with comma separated values and then you can assign that

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,250
result into some variable.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,650
No year.

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,780
Your ex is available on my values is also variable.

31
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,780
But there is a small difference between these two.

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,160
That is X is a normal variable and which is used to hold only one single value.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,420
No,

34
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,550
I have a list list off values.

35
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,900
I store this list off.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,050
Listen to this variable,

37
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,060
right?

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,160
I collector collection off data on I store that daytime to one variable called my values.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,240
Now here my values is also variable,

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,350
but it is storing multiple date us or now this is called data structure.

41
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,700
Right?

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,450
So there is no much difference between your normal variable and data structure Variable.

43
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,280
Both are variable.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,830
The only thing is your normal variable is able to hold one value.

45
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,850
But you're data structure.

46
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,350
Variable is hold is able to hold multiple values.

47
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,600
Right?

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,100
That's it.

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Other than that,

50
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,370
nothing is that.

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,330
But how you are going toe structure your data.

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,430
How you're going to store your daytime into your variable One of the symbols you're using.

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,070
Based on this,

54
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,650
we help different types of data structures with your python.

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,520
Right.

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,600
Let me start there.

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,510
First thing Data structures are used to store a collection off data that collection of data

58
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,830
maybe pure indigenous pure floor.

59
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,450
Right?

60
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,490
Are your string numbers string values or maybe combination of all?

61
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,470
No problem.

62
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,330
You can store any type of data combination off any type of data,

63
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,450
as you can store into your data structure.

64
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,850
Right.

65
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,910
Then there are four building data structures with your python.

66
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,060
Right.

67
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,430
Building means by differently.

68
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,850
Hold this data structures.

69
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,930
So based on some models,

70
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,020
you may get some other data structures as well.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,050
I suppose if you go with a raise modules you how some are a data structure.

72
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay,

73
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:23,870
as off.

74
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,280
Nobody fault with your python you are getting These are the four different date of success

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,180
with your bite on.

76
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,050
They are by default you have with your python.

77
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,350
Okay,

78
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,950
no list your traveling with square records.

79
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,200
I mean your radio data inside off this couple while writing your data you are to use

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,730
parentis is dick story.

81
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,770
You want to write the order with Carly braces with key value pair representation.

82
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:57,250
Like your deck storybook set starts at 11 with curly braces,

83
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,350
but values are like list in trouble,

84
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,580
but there is some unique property with such.

85
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,960
We'll see them so that this these are the off four data structures on.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,350
As an automation engineer,

87
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,810
you should be good with 1st 3 data structures.

88
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,780
Right on.

89
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,790
We will see about the H data stock just separately.

90
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,450
Okay.

91
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,540
In later videos.

92
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,260
So as have no,

93
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,870
you have to remember,

94
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,250
there are four data structures,

95
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,210
right?

96
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,150
All data structures are used to store multiple data or collection off data.

97
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,920
Right.

98
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,560
There is a purpose of data structures and finally hot.

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,450
Remember that data structures are also your variables.

100
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,820
All right.

101
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
Okay,

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:38,950
guys,

103
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,250
thank you for watching this video.
