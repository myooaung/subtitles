1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
friends here we're going to discuss about fight on functions concept.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,450
Simply introduction part with your functions before going to work with your functions.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,660
Let us agenda.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,380
We harvest some core,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,020
which consist off support someone 50 lines.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,950
So I have a 1 50 lines off course.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,280
And if you have got this entire court somewhere,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,650
I'm rebuilding same logic in different places.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,170
A gym,

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,650
that same logic.

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm repeating in three places.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,780
Imagine that Each logic consist of support.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,850
Some 30 lines.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,590
That means same 30 lines off logic you are repeating in three places.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,160
Not only three stage in dirt.

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,050
Some number of times you are repeating same type of Flossie night.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:55,510
See you for you are repeating the same logic in different places in their gaze.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,810
You need to write your logic in three places whenever If you're repeating what we will.

19
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,350
Louise,

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,010
whatever the logic you're repeating,

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,900
know that logic.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,220
I will ride in one place in my court itself and I will give some names suppers for that.

23
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,150
My Corp.

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,650
And now what I will lose.

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,650
I will remove these 30 lines off court in three places.

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,490
Very,

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,980
very hot.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,050
30 lines off court,

29
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,450
right they're simply write my core.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,480
I have given a name for that lines off.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,910
Corno!

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,650
My court.

33
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,050
Now here I am giving my Corp my court.

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,640
They No,

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,590
this is what I'm doing is see,

36
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,660
actually how 1 50 lines off court in this 1 50 lines off court 30 plus 30 plus 90 90 lines

37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,100
Place remain in 60 lines.

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,050
Finally won 50 lines off court,

39
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,810
but 30 lines off away.

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,380
Repeating in three places that Vincent chin off the 90 lines.

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,150
What we are doing is that the lanes off course I'm ready in somewhere.

42
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,190
Where were the static lines Off court is required There.

43
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,240
I will write the name Richard.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,540
I'll give Ben for these 30 lines off court.

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,510
So what is the name given my core?

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,540
So here I like my Cordish after t line.

47
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:14,790
Simply.

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm writing only one line.

49
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,510
So you're serving 29 lines.

50
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,650
You're reducing 29 lines in this place.

51
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,920
Same A in this 30 lines.

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,390
I'm living the morning this star Tila and simply I'm writing my core.

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,550
That it I'm giving the name.

54
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,940
Then again here,

55
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,050
also producing 29 lines.

56
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,230
So then here also you're having 30 lines No,

57
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm removed.

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,210
Removing these 30 lines off court and simply I'm writing whatever the name have given for

59
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,870
the study lines.

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,450
My court.

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,150
Then he also you're using 29 line numbers.

62
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,610
So instead off 90 lines.

63
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,650
Now you're using only three lines.

64
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,150
Bliss in the same core itself.

65
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,810
You are giving a name for your 30 lines.

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,440
30 lines.

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,050
Place name,

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,550
31 lengths.

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,650
So finally or writing 34 lines injured off 90 lines.

70
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:12,020
So you almost reduced 60 or 50 six lengths,

71
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,600
like so,

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,870
you are able to reduce your length off the court.

73
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,750
Let me give a simple example.

74
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,350
You can easily understand that.

75
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,120
Suppose I have a small requirement that the purpose off requirement I'm in the requirement

76
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,450
days,

77
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,080
but nobody five on my pipe landscape.

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,060
It has to clear my command line.

79
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,350
Then it has to display the list off files and directories,

80
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,850
right?

81
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:41,350
See that I am writing something like I need to run commenced like a seal less suppose

82
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,400
windows under in CLS common,

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,350
and then be a are common right.

84
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,480
So to run your commands,

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,710
you have two options in your python ways,

86
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,340
their system,

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,160
and then so process My Of course,

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,250
you're also having ways that people open process will open.

89
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,250
But anyway,

90
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,250
what is the system?

91
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,450
And so process are the best.

92
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,550
Our process to run your commands.

93
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,840
And whenever,

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,200
If you want to capture the output,

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
then go with the sub process.

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,420
Just simply if you want or under common,

97
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,000
just to go with the way his dart system.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,980
That's why here,

99
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,100
minding his intention,

100
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,610
it just I wanted under command.

101
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,930
So I'm importing boys.

102
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,680
So simply,

103
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,890
where's your system?

104
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,470
See?

105
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,350
Unless I'm running,

106
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,750
then ways door system.

107
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,400
What?

108
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm running.

109
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,480
Ah,

110
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,330
the air coming.

111
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:27,850
That's it.

112
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,550
Right Now let me go Toe Common line on then.

113
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,930
So how gonna skip Name is on your comments.

114
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,370
Dark people.

115
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:36,880
I know.

116
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,550
Let me run it.

117
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,570
Yes,

118
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,150
it's clearing your screen on it is displaying something.

119
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,120
But I want to display or something like,

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,450
uh,

121
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,550
Brink.

Please wait.

123
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,230
Kathleen E known off this just for clarity.

124
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm giving number of lines.

125
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,750
Please wait.

126
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,850
Cleaning the screen.

127
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,750
That's it,

128
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,010
then.

129
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,550
After this print,

130
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,750
please wait.

131
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,400
Finding the list off territories on face.

132
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,640
That's it.

133
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,020
No.

134
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,950
Let me Ronnie.

135
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,190
Yes,

136
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,240
you're getting but after displaying,

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,170
please Way to finding the list off directories and files.

138
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,510
I want to wait for two seconds before excluding the next line.

139
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm in business before excluding this line the same way After printing this line,

140
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,140
I want to wait for two seconds before excluding this way Is that system so that I can see

141
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,250
this information Otherwise this information is also going to clean on your common lane.

142
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,890
So to wait for some time you have a time model anyway will discuss Ah about time or will

143
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:55,600
indeed a So what I'm doing is after displaying this message is I don't want to go next.

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Good.

145
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,390
Next line.

146
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to wait for two seconds.

147
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,240
I want to stop your process with your python.

148
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,320
Then simply time.

149
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,570
Don't sleep off two seconds.

150
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,320
I want to wait the same way.

151
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,950
After displaying this message,

152
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,870
I want to wait again.

153
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:18,360
Suppose sorry time dot Sleep supposed to seconds right now.

154
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,750
Let me down.

155
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,650
You can see the output.

156
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,090
So it is waiting two seconds.

157
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,710
Then after that,

158
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,900
it is waiting again to second.

159
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,850
Then you're getting your data.

160
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,950
That's fine.

161
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:33,650
Suppose if I copied the score on If I try to run this on my UNIX Lexus down,

162
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,730
right?

163
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,380
Let me write.

164
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,120
Simply run.

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,230
You are common.

166
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,400
Start the way script.

167
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,320
So Sanskrit.

168
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm copying and pasting here.

169
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,850
Would it look?

170
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,380
See?

171
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,690
That isn't so.

172
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,390
I won't run using fight on three.

173
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,940
See?

174
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,620
Seal is common is not working because see,

175
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,380
Ellis is not the command to clearly were come online off your innings like system C El er

176
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,470
is the common late on anywhere.

177
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,390
Dia is working,

178
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,090
but I want to get in detail in this way.

179
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,460
I want to get any hotter use ls Siphon LRT So on windows you have CLS and er for UNIX.

180
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,560
I need C l e a r l s iPhone LRT commands.

181
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,810
So what I am doing is before running your commands.

182
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm crying,

183
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,620
going for the platform.

184
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,250
You know,

185
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,410
there is a part for model on.

186
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,260
If you remember.

187
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,750
We discussed already aboard days,

188
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,440
right windows,

189
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,050
So he flat for Marxist.

190
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,280
The music was to windows.

191
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,250
Then I want to run this logic.

192
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,250
See the logic.

193
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:54,710
That's it else.

194
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,310
If it is not Windows,

195
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,820
what I'm doing is same logic,

196
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,740
but difference in comments.

197
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,780
See that same logic.

198
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,990
The only thing here.

199
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,340
See,

200
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,980
Ellie,

201
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,320
you are on a year.

202
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,750
L s iPhone LRT.

203
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,580
No.

204
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,660
First let me save it.

205
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,750
So,

206
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,020
guys,

207
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,350
how we design our script.

208
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,630
It's like a platform independent script.

209
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,640
It will exclude on your windows as well as UNIX.

210
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,450
Like systems on what is are finally your purpose.

211
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,750
Clear your screen,

212
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,420
then listen,

213
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,650
the There it is and finds in the current location.

214
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,730
Yes.

215
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,650
No,

216
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:37,850
I'm running our script clearing your screen.

217
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,960
Wait two seconds.

218
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Finding the stuff,

219
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,790
Gladys and files.

220
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,310
Then you're getting No.

221
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,650
What I will do is I'm going to copy this escape to your next like system as well.

222
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,780
So before that,

223
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,690
let me clean.

224
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,250
You are all the data?

225
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,160
No,

226
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm going to open same script.

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,080
I'm going to copy and paste the court,

228
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,850
which you have on your windows.

229
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,680
No,

230
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,620
seem la Z.

231
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Same script.

232
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,390
I'm running now.

233
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,250
One your window.

234
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,770
Sorry.

235
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,650
UNIX like system.

236
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,860
Now it's working.

237
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,250
See that?

238
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,450
That's why that's fine.

239
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,190
But the problem is,

240
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:18,280
if you observe your entire logic if you observe your and a la Z see if it clearly absorbed

241
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,150
this thing right on this thing.

242
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,200
Same logic you are repeating here and here.

243
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,110
The only thing comments are different.

244
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,090
This comer and discovering is different windows this common UNIX This comment Windows,

245
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,920
the air command lining sell a siphon alerted.

246
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,850
But as many as he could say no,

247
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,310
That means simply you are repeating same logic in two places as off Now,

248
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,650
only two places.

249
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,260
Maybe in real time you're going to repeat same kind off logic,

250
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,550
maybe in 100 times or 10 times or five times based on your requirement.

251
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,920
As of now,

252
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,250
I am repeating my logic in two places.

253
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,710
Forget about commands.

254
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,600
Logic is saying no.

255
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,250
So what I will do is in my quarter itself,

256
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,450
right?

257
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,390
This logic I will lead somewhere with some name with some name.

258
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,160
I'm giving name for that.

259
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,490
Supposed my court.

260
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,590
You can probably any law name for that.

261
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,180
Okay,

262
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,500
we'll learn in detail Award Toho toe.

263
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,140
Define your name for your logic.

264
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,050
Everything will learn while going forward for timing just after the logic.

265
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,950
That's it.

266
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,870
No engine off for No.

267
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,590
Forget about all this year less.

268
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,130
I'm taking that as a command one on.

269
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,650
I'm taking this as common toe.

270
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,430
Okay,

271
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,730
Don't worry why we're taking command one and comment will discuss in details while going

272
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,150
forward.

273
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,100
But here mind ends is if you're repeating the LA Zeke,

274
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,950
why should we repeat that logic?

275
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,050
I don't want to repeat,

276
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,910
right.

277
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,430
See,

278
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,980
Actually,

279
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,870
whatever the logic,

280
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,350
you are repeating that I removed.

281
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,960
Right?

282
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,510
But this is the logic you're repeating,

283
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:03,760
right?

284
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,390
That's why What is the name you are even for this logic?

285
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,980
This is the name you have given that name.

286
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,150
I will read here and here.

287
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,050
That's it.

288
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,650
So that your logic is over.

289
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,540
But how it is going to work,

290
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,850
we'll discuss it.

291
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,350
My core.

292
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,640
Then here also,

293
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,950
I'm writing my court.

294
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,930
No,

295
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,070
internally Python will replace in place off my core this entire lousy again.

296
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,520
Same cool.

297
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,870
Only you are not descending anything.

298
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,440
The only thing you're reducing the number of lines engine off are rewriting the same logic

299
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,590
in different places.

300
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,640
What we're doing,

301
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,340
we're writing in one place.

302
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,030
We're giving some name for that.

303
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,260
Remember,

304
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,790
if it is required in your code in giraffe writing,

305
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,850
that entire logic simply were writing the name which you have given for your logic.

306
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,140
Right?

307
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,280
So for these are given a name called My Core that I'm reading here in here now,

308
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,200
internally hydrogen,

309
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,250
that my car is nothing but this entire lines you can assume in place off my court.

310
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,350
A need also in place off my quarry cannot human entirely these lines.

311
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,400
So finally,

312
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
we're not disturbing with your court.

313
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,900
Right?

314
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,050
But whenever if I'm working with knows I need to run something like CLS.

315
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,190
Don't worry how I'm giving this.

316
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,610
Ah,

317
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,470
syntax.

318
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,700
Okay.

319
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,400
Just abdullah concept that we'll discuss in detail.

320
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,740
That's it.

321
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,860
Let me save it.

322
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,150
So that's what I'm doing.

323
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,960
I'm sure there the logic which you are repeating that logic I have it in somewhere are now

324
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,200
given some name for that.

325
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,300
So in your court previously wherever you are using this logic in that place simply I'm

326
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,160
giving this name.

327
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,650
That's it.

328
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,040
No,

329
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,650
let me money.

330
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,220
If it is working perfectly,

331
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,320
then the way which you use year.

332
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,050
That's correct.

333
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,050
Night.

334
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,620
Yes,

335
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,080
it's working.

336
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,340
No,

337
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,050
See that?

338
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,520
That means whatever the processes we followed,

339
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,350
that is correct.

340
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,320
So if you followed this process,

341
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,720
what is that?

342
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,240
One day you're going to reduce the number off lines or in the worst way,

343
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,650
you can ableto reuse this logic Any number off times in your core That is that one day

344
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,480
wherever you need their you know,

345
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,730
neither.

346
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,610
I didn't know simply You're going to you.

347
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:24,750
You use this name reusable D right Now that we copy this court to urine expect systems as

348
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:24,940
well.

349
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,950
They're also I want running.

350
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:32,730
Let me coop in.

351
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,900
Mr Right.

352
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,650
I'm going to run it.

353
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,050
So here also it is going to work perfectly.

354
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,250
See that?

355
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,760
Not a right.

356
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,180
So they in case if you use this concept,

357
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,370
then this is called a function on.

358
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,450
You can reuse dysfunction any number of times in your court where where it is required,

359
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,620
right?

360
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,630
So how do you define how to use them?

361
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,750
All those things we will see.

362
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,250
Okay.

363
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,500
And one more thing.

364
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,310
This is a function simply This is a function,

365
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,510
you know,

366
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,620
function means some operation is there with function.

367
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,420
That is how was if we take off X equals to some three express to therefore fixes a function

368
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,780
on its operation is very explicit.

369
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,860
No,

370
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,140
here my court is a function that is nothing but I for fix.

371
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,830
If you come back with your mathematics Mike,

372
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,480
what is a function that is ffx right?

373
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,600
My quarry simply off here.

374
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,820
Common one command Don't assume that x No.

375
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,580
Based on the X,

376
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,900
you're getting your f of X value by executing this three express to expression the same way

377
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,150
based Don't command one and common to your getting final result for your my core.

378
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,750
By excluding this logic,

379
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,530
right,

380
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,840
see if you're good with your mathematics is very easy.

381
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,050
Toe compare.

382
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,350
I just assumed that three explains to is nothing but this part.

383
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,740
My court is nothing but 1/2 and come and one comment.

384
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,950
Got nothing but eggs.

385
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,000
So three express to depends on X value.

386
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,270
So,

387
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,180
based on X value,

388
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,820
finally are getting,

389
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,450
if off x value the same day.

390
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,860
This logic depends on common or uncommon toe.

391
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,900
Based on this comment on command to finally finally are getting the result off my core.

392
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,670
That's why this is simply a function same as your mathematic concepts that is,

393
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,150
on paper,

394
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,120
that is on memory.

395
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,450
That's it.

396
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,290
You're excluding with your bite on software not to.

397
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,710
So this is a function like these.

398
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,790
Some variables as off No,

399
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,130
but not variables.

400
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,230
We have some other name.

401
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,310
We'll see that en fr fix.

402
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,360
Every is the function X is available somewhere.

403
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,010
This is a function in terms off common.

404
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,800
One uncommon toe.

405
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,150
That's it.

406
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,150
Right?

407
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,380
So finally,

408
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,050
I want to give the a simple definition for your function.

409
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,520
Function is a block off court for some specific operation.

410
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,130
That operation,

411
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,150
maybe anything based on your requirement in your situation,

412
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,580
right Once,

413
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,720
If you define your function,

414
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,950
you can reuse that any number of times you can use in your core where what is required

415
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:20,350
right are a function excuse only when it is called See that.

416
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,760
Let me remove this.

417
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,110
Don't worry.

418
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,680
How do call?

419
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,480
We'll discuss that.

420
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,200
So hats off.

421
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,340
No,

422
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,350
just I defined a function.

423
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,130
Know where I am using this,

424
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,420
right?

425
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,350
I'm are using here.

426
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,970
So previously you are using here and here 13 plane,

427
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,010
15 line supposed If I come and discord know where you are using that If you are not using,

428
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,280
then if you run your court,

429
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,230
it won't eggs cure even Let me run down your common lane.

430
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,700
That is,

431
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,260
You will get clarity like is not excluding your even believe you have a function.

432
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,650
It won't execute by itself.

433
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,650
If you want to exclude your function,

434
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,510
you should use the word somewhere in your core.

435
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,900
That's a that is a concept off your function.

436
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,070
Okay,

437
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:05,430
So,

438
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:05,660
guys,

439
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,580
this is simply interaction part with your functions.

440
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,530
Okay?

441
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,840
In later videos,

442
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,980
we'll go with step by step and we will learn completely about your functions.

443
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,950
Right on.

444
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,020
Then we will see how to use in real time for different scenarios.

445
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,050
Okay.

446
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,740
Okay,

447
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,960
guys,

448
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,260
thank you for watching this video.
