00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
friends here.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.470
We're going to discuss about ways dot System off your waist model.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.040
Actually,

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.930
this way is not system is a function.

5
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.510
Because if you are very here arguing parentis is the purpose off this way start system

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:24.420
function from your ways model is just to excuse you our operating system commands See as

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.590
off.

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.840
No,

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.630
we have seen some off the commands from your fight on to work with your opening systems.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
Like ways dot list that we removed a tree cream Ignorantly change that.

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.820
We get current working battery,

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.210
right?

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.650
But in case,

14
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:48.130
if you don't have any command from your python to work with your operating system on if you

15
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.590
know the common off your operating system on if you want to execute you were opening system

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.810
Come and with fight on,

17
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.750
then this ways door system is helpful.

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.150
See,

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.640
there is a common called pwd.

20
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.230
Suppose on your UNIX like systems.

21
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.360
What?

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.950
Is that What you're getting current working directory or where you are on your terminal,

23
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.220
right?

24
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.150
See with your ways model night.

25
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.690
Where's door?

26
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.650
Get current working?

27
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.450
There it is there,

28
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.230
But I assume that you forgot about this ways.

29
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.500
Don't get cwt because if you go with ways door supposed ah,

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.920
listen,

31
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.410
territories There are different commands right from your fight on to work with your

32
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.150
operating system,

33
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.750
but by mistake ah,

34
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.310
otherwise are simply assume that I forgot about this aways door.

35
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.670
Get CWD with or listen territories.

36
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550
Where is Lord Magnet is something like that.

37
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:53.240
Then what I can do is simply I can use ways dot system other than I can run my but your

38
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.250
operating system commands.

39
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.760
See that are then ways door system I can done.

40
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.550
Let's come in.

41
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.290
See that?

42
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.920
Put right,

43
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.490
you are able to execute.

44
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.100
You are operating system commands with help off.

45
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.050
Where's their system?

46
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.440
Not only Lennox.

47
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.720
You can also exclude from your windows as well.

48
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.150
Let me enter into my piped on.

49
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.750
Let me in Broadway's ways dot system.

50
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.250
I can run something like the Air Command.

51
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.130
Yes,

52
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.660
you're getting old.

53
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.210
Put right.

54
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.160
The It is the common for your of no suffering system to list your directories and files in

55
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.050
the current location.

56
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.450
Same thing you can run with your waste Gord system as well through bite on.

57
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.890
So simply where's that system?

58
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.330
Is helpful to excuse me.

59
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.850
What operating system commands.

60
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.070
See to clear my colonel.

61
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.490
Right?

62
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.650
If it is Lennox,

63
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.330
I'm using C el er clear command.

64
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.160
If it is windows,

65
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.890
how do you see?

66
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.890
Unless I see that what I'm doing ways dot System because I am on line excise off.

67
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.220
No,

68
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.710
I'm running with our system.

69
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.560
Clear now.

70
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.000
Your family is clearing.

71
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.110
Let me open.

72
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.850
You are Windows terminal?

73
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.570
No,

74
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.700
I am in potential,

75
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.060
but I want to execute windows Common called CLS.

76
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.250
Yes,

77
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.070
you can execute it.

78
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.260
You know what is the result?

79
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.000
Off CLS?

80
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.650
It will simply clear your screen.

81
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.650
Yes,

82
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.250
that's what it is doing.

83
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.060
But if you are very here,

84
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.500
guys,

85
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.090
while running your commons,

86
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.150
it may be any calmer.

87
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.140
Right?

88
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.500
See that put you're getting you're able to display your or put directly with help off your

89
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.150
way is not system right At the same time,

90
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.850
you're getting some written cord.

91
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.500
So here you are,

92
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.220
reading zero.

93
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.350
That means whatever the common you're running with the way the system that is success,

94
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.100
right?

95
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100
Not only that,

96
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.730
here also let me simply run Ah,

97
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.350
ways door system.

98
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.340
No,

99
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.610
I am on UNIX box.

100
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.050
Simon Incredibly comer.

101
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.100
See the reserve?

102
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.880
You're getting part current working directory and also getting some geo.

103
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.590
There is a return court from your waist,

104
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.600
our system it really Jiro.

105
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.550
Then whatever the command you are running that waas success that was successfully excluded

106
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.650
by your way of your system,

107
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.230
let's say I'm running ways your system something called random common which is not a valid

108
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.080
come and ask for your operating system.

109
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.340
That's why I see the output body are getting You're getting some error.

110
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.200
Along with that,

111
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.670
they can call as non Jiro.

112
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.450
See that I'm not writing something like that.

113
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.970
R T equals two.

114
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.750
Where's dot system?

115
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.460
Some ls guys,

116
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.760
If I run in this way,

117
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.840
be clear,

118
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.060
it's very important what I order output you're going to get from your ways door system with

119
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.640
help off allow to run.

120
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.510
You are less common that output wound to go on store in tow.

121
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:55.180
This simply the return status off this executed syntax that will store into this rt.

122
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.110
That means in case if it is excluding successfully,

123
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.480
then juror will store into this Always non euro will start into that now see the output so

124
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.900
previously,

125
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.220
whenever if you're running your command,

126
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.170
you're getting all put and also some return court.

127
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.310
But now I am assigning that African according to some variable.

128
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.480
Now you're getting only open.

129
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.520
Make sure that where's that system or put your not able to store into any variable you can

130
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.030
store.

131
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.350
The only thing you can definitely display your put,

132
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.570
but what it will store in case if you assign your ways or system some commander put into a

133
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.250
variable,

134
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.610
What is the value you're going to store in the dark?

135
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.410
Simply simply the executed commander Status verities.

136
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.120
Whether it is such a sore fate,

137
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.250
that status you're going to store into RT,

138
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.540
right?

139
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.080
See that?

140
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.930
Let me make this simple script so that they can understand we a runways comments I'm

141
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.330
writing.

142
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.450
Runway is not the way our ways comments.

143
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.810
Interrupt this just for clarity.

144
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.510
Am ready run ways Commands dot people are any common also,

145
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.320
so I can run with help.

146
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.070
04 years.

147
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.880
I mean,

148
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.750
where is that system?

149
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.630
You're also having different positions case we will see we're going forward for timing.

150
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.410
It is important I am working with this.

151
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.130
See,

152
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.450
common is always a string.

153
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.750
You have to remember that suppose of my communities.

154
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.910
Let's a date coming Like I know what I'm doing is ways dot system Then you're coming.

155
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.920
So already I store my commanding to see Emily Variable as a string.

156
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.120
No,

157
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.950
I can provide that.

158
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.680
Let me a story and see the U.

159
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.570
S script ones.

160
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.750
Now I'm going to run this script.

161
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.790
You're getting old put right?

162
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.480
But nobody feel running your Where's your system from your pie?

163
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.000
Transcript?

164
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.380
No Nieto printed the result automatically the sprinting the result Right now what I'm doing

165
00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.430
is maybe as of no dead command is perfect that we're getting old put right?

166
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.420
Maybe I'm taking some wrong command now.

167
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.100
See the output?

168
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.830
No,

169
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.750
they never If it is wrong,

170
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.190
command your waster system,

171
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.860
will you?

172
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.990
Some return courts.

173
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.040
I want to capture that.

174
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.590
Let me take r equals two.

175
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.800
What is that system?

176
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.070
Some calmer now I can take some of condition If rt close to Jiro then I can say that Bring

177
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:34.050
You are whatever the command you are having your comment was success successfully executed

178
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:43.370
else else?

179
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.150
Because if art is not equals,

180
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:53.680
two Germans fill Your common was failed Not but a symbol.

181
00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.480
I can capture the return status off this command means if this command was success than I

182
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.350
can capture Jiro into this art available,

183
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.700
you can take any variably and not only rt simply I'm taking return code.

184
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.380
That's why I'm taking what is the variable.

185
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.140
But it can take simply X also right?

186
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.530
No,

187
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.190
See the output.

188
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.910
I'm running your script before running.

189
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.400
Just a weapon.

190
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.050
He was stripped.

191
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.270
Right?

192
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.640
See,

193
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.400
this is your scripture.

194
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.280
Now I'm running that.

195
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.120
See the result?

196
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.450
Your common waas failed,

197
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.500
right?

198
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.230
No.

199
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.690
See that?

200
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.150
What I'm doing is you were command,

201
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.530
right?

202
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:34.890
Yeah.

203
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.800
I'm going to give no valid,

204
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.720
valid common.

205
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.010
That is a valid command.

206
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:39.250
Right?

207
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:45.550
We'll see that your common was successfully executed.

208
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:53.680
So they make sure that ways dot system is used to execute your any operating system

209
00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.890
commands on while excluding your commands with ways your system in your python skip by

210
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.330
default,

211
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.050
it will print the output off your comment on your terminal.

212
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.650
Well done in your script.

213
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.790
At the same time,

214
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.460
it is also given It is also going to give some Britain court based on whether you're

215
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.930
commanded.

216
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.670
Success or not.

217
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.860
If you're comin,

218
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.610
your successes,

219
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.100
your ways are system,

220
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.570
will you,

221
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.000
Jiro as the core.

222
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.060
If your command was failed,

223
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.120
then your waste Our system command,

224
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.370
will you written court are court as non zero value based under.

225
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.200
I can't decide whether the success or not.

226
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.270
Right.

227
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.550
Okay.

228
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.830
Okay,

229
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.830
so we're going forward.

230
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.810
We will use this ways or system command.

231
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.890
And we will write a lot of scripts using this way.

232
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.460
Start system I Okay.

233
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.950
