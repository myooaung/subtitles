00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
friends here we're writing a simple pythons crypto.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.350
Find all Tom carts home on conflict file locations on your host.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.050
So you can also extended this a scrip to find Tomcat Washington.

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.350
And what is the port is using for your Tomcat?

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.230
And one more thing.

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.330
I'm implementing this escape first,

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.350
by using your functions concert,

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.210
Then I will extend that the script,

9
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.480
using hopes concept as well so that they will get some idea about how we're going to use

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.550
hoops concept.

11
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.550
Let me open my Lennox walks.

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.740
See if you want to find Tomcat.

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.230
Always.

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.150
The flu point is Rodarte XML.

15
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.620
I suppose if you're working with a party,

16
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.420
then the clue point is http dot com If you're working with supposed Web logic,

17
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.150
then we're blogging dot xml is the clue point.

18
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.390
I mean,

19
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.570
suppose if I find something called sir,

20
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.380
we're dot xml based on this number off files,

21
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.590
I can say that that many number off Tomcats are running on this coast.

22
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.050
That's it.

23
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.090
So we're not X eman on One more thing I am running this command.

24
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
Suppose here from route even our skipped We're going to run from route because we don't

25
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.450
know from which user you're running your tom care.

26
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.830
But you know,

27
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.590
from rookie,

28
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.930
you're having access for all locations.

29
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660
That way we are winter on our by.

30
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.650
Transcript from road No,

31
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.310
here I'm taking my python Skip name has get Tomcat home conflict file on locations.

32
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.450
Right?

33
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.550
And one more thing.

34
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.120
So on my host Ah,

35
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.560
how by turn to fight on three as well.

36
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350
So this is the fight on three location,

37
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.450
then let generate very first line as your interpreter line.

38
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.150
That's it.

39
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.200
Now I need a model called boys.

40
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840
That's fine.

41
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.250
Now let me Right.

42
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.050
Very first line us.

43
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.250
That's it.

44
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250
Now let me defend some very one main function,

45
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.450
Right?

46
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.250
Let me take a variable called list off Tomcats.

47
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
You don't know how many time cuts you're having.

48
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.990
You need to find that logically.

49
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.150
So no.

50
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.400
If you run this script on your host,

51
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.100
if you're suppose some 10 Tomcats it has to find all the 10 timecards.

52
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.850
Suppose if you how Gino Dumb girls they don't find.

53
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.430
So in that where we are implementing this court,

54
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.010
get all Tomcats.

55
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.120
That's it.

56
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.250
Now let me define that function somewhere.

57
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.450
Get all tomcats!

58
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.830
So we are working on Tomcats,

59
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.150
right?

60
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.820
The first of all,

61
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.090
what I'm doing is for root territories and files in ways dot Walk.

62
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.410
We are discussed about ways.

63
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.520
Don't work in entire file system.

64
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm looking for each and every file.

65
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.510
No.

66
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.950
For each file in your list or files.

67
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.550
If you want h file,

68
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.240
it is equals to sir.

69
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.450
We're not XML then.

70
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.400
Guys,

71
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.280
we know that you're going to get through territory anyway.

72
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.550
You're you don't You're not working on their place.

73
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.750
You are looking only files.

74
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.510
So in road,

75
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.250
right?

76
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.150
You're going to get least off files in this.

77
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.750
And parties are so in this file in this files,

78
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.830
we had to take one by one,

79
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.450
file out,

80
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.400
and I want to come back that file of its ordered XML.

81
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.050
In case if it is a road or XML,

82
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.370
then I need to store that complete part off sort of example into some location.

83
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:42.520
Let's say I'm taking list off conflict files equals two A list.

84
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.210
Empty list,

85
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.150
Mostly that.

86
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:56.380
Let me list off conflict files dot A pen ways dot part dot Join You are rude directly with

87
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.250
your each file.

88
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.840
That's a so by the completion off your for Luke.

89
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.960
You're going to get all sort of maximal files with complete part.

90
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.290
Then that list that list off files we are storing in the available core list off conflict

91
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.720
files.

92
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.920
No any to return that.

93
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.220
So that in main function,

94
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.730
whatever the variable we define into dark,

95
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.650
this list off convict files will store.

96
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.890
Right?

97
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.150
So you just I'm writing one prince treatment here for our understanding finding list off

98
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.350
Tomcats.

99
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.850
That's a no.

100
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.600
Let me print that list off blankets.

101
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.980
So as of now,

102
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.490
we're finding only the list off Tomcats.

103
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.850
I mean,

104
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.550
in terms off configuration file.

105
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.180
Now,

106
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.420
let me provide execution permission for your file.

107
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.450
Then let me run days and see that is very finding list off Tomcats.

108
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.330
So least off Tomcats is always you can find with the help of Sardar XML.

109
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:11.200
File what happened or return?

110
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.650
None.

111
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.720
Let's stuff Tomcat.

112
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.940
Oh,

113
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.350
sorry.

114
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.490
I ordered an income,

115
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.190
so I mean,

116
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.230
as a string that is available,

117
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.470
right?

118
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.330
We should not take conditions now.

119
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.990
See the result?

120
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.570
Yes.

121
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.460
You're getting two configuration files.

122
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.050
That means on your horse we're having to Tom Kurtz.

123
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.350
No,

124
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.740
I want to create a separate variable for each and every Tomcat such that in that variable I

125
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.780
should store Tomcat home as well as conflict file.

126
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.250
Then how can I do it?

127
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.750
See that?

128
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:58.950
Let me come in this line first thing What I'm saying is I want to take one by one for each

129
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:07.700
conflict file for each conflict file in your list off farm cats,

130
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.240
then that it like,

131
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.370
and print days buried like an print.

132
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:24.650
Suppose See that our Tom car to home is Then I can say ways dot but the door D a r name.

133
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.250
So this time get home means in your configuration files upto This is the Tomcat home.

134
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.410
That's why I need to come to levels back in your configuration file so far that what I'm

135
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.150
doing is two times I'm coming back from your configuration file.

136
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.510
Where is the bader?

137
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.430
The air name?

138
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:49.310
You were each conflict file then.

139
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.440
Apparently,

140
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.050
I can print the conflict file as well.

141
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.070
Of course,

142
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.750
this is correct.

143
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.550
Tom card conflict file is so definitely whatever the file you're having in your hand,

144
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.970
that is conflict.

145
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.810
While only no,

146
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.050
by this your court is over.

147
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.400
No,

148
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:22.090
Let me simply bring in four for I'm gut Let's say here I want to point some variable some

149
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.640
get one and Tom care to then hear.

150
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.750
What I can do is we know how many Tom guards are there.

151
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.600
So ConEd equals two length off list off Tomcats,

152
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.850
right?

153
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.890
Anyway,

154
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.350
otherwise you're you're repeating loop,

155
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.560
right?

156
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.550
Simply can't take in Chile counties one.

157
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.940
So I can write a year counter variable,

158
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.920
then are for completion off your information for your first variable.

159
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.280
Simply,

160
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.150
I can increase counter value.

161
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.290
That's it.

162
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.250
Now let me run the score and see the output.

163
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.030
Yes,

164
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.430
other.

165
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.660
Or put finding the stuff Tomcats.

166
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.270
Then in 44 time,

167
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.490
get one So time get home on time,

168
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.610
Get conflict file in 44 time ghetto you are getting but directly or displaying.

169
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:20.400
But sometimes you may how requirement on the result off this tomcat one time Catto so that

170
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.650
you need to store these values into some variable.

171
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.200
So to start this time,

172
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.970
get one home on conflict file.

173
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.750
India variable what you can take what type of registered Kerrigan select.

174
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.150
So what if we go on select list?

175
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.880
It is not about one time.

176
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.860
Get your having to dump gets then if you take only list,

177
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.840
then you have to append the first time.

178
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.470
Get home.

179
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.090
First time get conflict file,

180
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.930
then second time,

181
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.530
cut home,

182
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.170
then Second Tomcat Conflict five.

183
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.550
That means always you're storing into one configuration file.

184
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.290
Sorry,

185
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.050
one list.

186
00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:00.010
And from the least you have to take one by one value based on index.

187
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.250
But that is not correct.

188
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.810
Why?

189
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.550
Because see that?

190
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.550
Let me dick,

191
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:10.850
whom conflict file files equals toe.

192
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:18.050
Then instead of printing in soft printing,

193
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.620
what I will do is let me come in.

194
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.300
This lights,

195
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.560
anything is fine.

196
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:39.950
But just I'm writing in this way whom conflict files dot a pain this value but opening

197
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.610
multiple tomcats in the single.

198
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.050
This is not a good practice,

199
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.930
so configuration file.

200
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.450
I'm opening at the same time.

201
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:49.880
I need to Ah,

202
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.010
pain in tow.

203
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.290
That your conflict?

204
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:52.600
Sorry.

205
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.140
As if no,

206
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.750
I opened it.

207
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.050
Whom the 90 Karpin you were Conflict fight.

208
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.530
So,

209
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.250
for first to look,

210
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.280
we're going to a friend in this list.

211
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.240
1st 2 Tomcats,

212
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.270
second loop again.

213
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.320
You're continue continuously happening.

214
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.740
Second time guarded ills.

215
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.550
That means the entire all Tom Cares doodles you're storing into one corn one list,

216
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.200
But that is not a good.

217
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.850
That's why what I'm doing is I'm going to take a dictionary.

218
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.620
I'm going to I'm going to take a victory,

219
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.650
not let me remove all these values.

220
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.620
See that?

221
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.140
What?

222
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.220
I'm doing These first,

223
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.810
let me find simply Tom.

224
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.510
Get home.

225
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.240
So it is nothing.

226
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.350
But where's that park?

227
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.400
Dirty air name,

228
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.370
then.

229
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.610
Ways dot dot dot B a r name.

230
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.850
Then you work configuration fight.

231
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.580
Then you know,

232
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:55.250
Tomcat conflict file equals to simply you are each conflict file only.

233
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.750
That's fine.

234
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.900
No offer that.

235
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.560
What I will do is I will create a key in my dick study.

236
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.550
So home conflict files,

237
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.650
Tom,

238
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.250
cut.

239
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.440
Bless for Tom.

240
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.660
Get when I'm creating a key.

241
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.070
Call time.

242
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.960
Get one because you don't know how many time cats are there.

243
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.480
Dynamically.

244
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.820
I'm going to create kiss.

245
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.930
So string off you are common then in the key.

246
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.950
I'm Harding.

247
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.050
You're list values.

248
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.270
One is Tom.

249
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.850
Get home,

250
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.970
guys.

251
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.470
Maybe I'm extending this concept on necessarily,

252
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.930
But if you go in this way,

253
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.460
you'll get some idea while writing hoops concert.

254
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:38.920
For that,

255
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.790
I am writing in this way.

256
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.760
Then,

257
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.260
after completion of your for loop,

258
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.150
suppose if I try to print you are home and conflict files.

259
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:52.310
You're going to get a victory on the You can see the output for that very clearly in terms

260
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.310
.

261
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.650
Off key and values keys.

262
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:55.870
Tom,

263
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:56.360
get one,

264
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.440
then valleys are home and conflagration for you.

265
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.640
Then one more key.

266
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.150
See there.

267
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.600
I'm get one home on conflict file.

268
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.780
Respect to home Respect a conflict for Tom Care to respect to home and desperate to convict

269
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.050
Feit.

270
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.250
That's fine.

271
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.950
No,

272
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.790
As if no,

273
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.450
you help.

274
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.430
You were a dictionary which consists off based on keys.

275
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.840
The number off Tomcats.

276
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.350
Now I want to display clearly we first Tomcat information and second time cut information.

277
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.610
Right?

278
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.630
So what I'm doing is for that I'm display.

279
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.350
I'm reading a display function Display details.

280
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.980
You guys actually unit off all these things that look alighting inside off your for Luke

281
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.850
print statement.

282
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.280
But sometimes you may how work on this values in different places in your core.

283
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.710
Are there time unit to store?

284
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.710
You are each time get details into some variable.

285
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:54.190
So the best away whenever the fee how multiple Tomcats not only multiple Tomcats.

286
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.700
Whenever If you're some multiple things in your court.

287
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.150
I mean,

288
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.740
on your host at that time you heard the story or data in your dick study nor display

289
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.860
details to display your details.

290
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.550
You need to send the variable value what you are going to display.

291
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.480
So anyway,

292
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.710
you're going toe Display your information from victory.

293
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.550
I need to pass that.

294
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.650
Then let me write somewhere this play details.

295
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.380
Then let me take.

296
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.130
You can take same argument.

297
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.510
Neymar.

298
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.060
You can also take different argument.

299
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:23.220
Name?

300
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:23.750
No problem,

301
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.800
right?

302
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.450
No,

303
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.410
no.

304
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.880
In this year,

305
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.950
How come Get one and time ghetto.

306
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.940
Maybe if you have some 10 time gets all time cards,

307
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.860
information will be there in this right?

308
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.950
No see that for each key.

309
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:46.340
Each key in you would home conflict files dot kiss,

310
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.880
you know,

311
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.550
kiss.

312
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:58.150
Then simply print each study home gone phrase from a key called it a key.

313
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.690
That's it,

314
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:06.020
then Simply a return None.

315
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:16.010
Now let me run the score and see the output It is finding your Tomcats.

316
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:24.090
Answer is finding seen already displaying your foster tomcat and second time got

317
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.500
information as a list off values.

318
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.950
That's fine,

319
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.640
but again from this,

320
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.470
if you want to separately display tomcat Home and Tomcat conflict file.

321
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.300
You had to write a logic here in this way.

322
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.760
See that what I'm writing here anyway,

323
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.830
Tomcat Home is always a listed index Kojiro into at least from God.

324
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:49.720
Conflict filings index one because it is Lenti.

325
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.640
But you need this information for you were Oops.

326
00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:03.950
Concert in the Tomcat home is so that is the list in the at least Jill Index,

327
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:17.420
then brain the go on cat conflict file.

328
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.800
He's Oh,

329
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.320
I'm using If string right in it.

330
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.730
Right,

331
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.820
Carl embraces,

332
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:39.950
then home can file h G off index one.

333
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.990
That's it.

334
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.070
Say we on Ronnie.

335
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:47.850
See that desert?

336
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.250
What happened?

337
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.840
Redundant.

338
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.350
Yeah,

339
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.720
Extra character.

340
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.280
No.

341
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.850
See the desert,

342
00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:02.040
right?

343
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.190
You're getting clearly or time.

344
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.830
Get home for first time,

345
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.060
Karen.

346
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.450
Second bomb Get that's fine.

347
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:13.270
Under the same information we're also getting from this loop itself without creating your

348
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:13.950
dictionary.

349
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.890
But what I am saying is sometimes you may how requirement on the result off this time cut

350
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.620
in another place in your core of that time.

351
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.770
In this story,

352
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.040
what data into some variable.

353
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.110
So here we have taken big study.

354
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.150
That's fine.

355
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.460
No,

356
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.150
gays just observed that you're having a dictionary in your hand.

357
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.950
If you want to print the information from your dictionary with the help of function for

358
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.030
your function in her toe,

359
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.650
pass your unit to pass your Dexter details.

360
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.630
But if I go with troops concert,

361
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.060
there is a small advantage.

362
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.990
First,

363
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.820
let me do one thing.

364
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.390
First thing you know,

365
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.650
hoops concert is useful to create an absurd.

366
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:54.460
So if there is nothing but if you are very here on your horse female,

367
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.180
any number of Tom Card's If you're someone.

368
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.640
Time Carrie.

369
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.650
How to create one object.

370
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.370
If you're some 10 Tomcats,

371
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:04.910
you need to create some 10 objects so dynamically hard to create your objects and one more

372
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.730
thing before going to create an object you should have a class on.

373
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.170
One more point is before going to create an object.

374
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.180
You have to know how many Tomcats out there on your host.

375
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.120
That's why,

376
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.500
first of all,

377
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.020
you need to take this logic toe.

378
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.480
Finally,

379
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.450
stuff Tom guards on your host.

380
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.260
There is no change in this court.

381
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:50.350
There is no change in this court because,

382
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.500
you know,

383
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.660
to find her foster fall.

384
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.610
Let me savor.

385
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:58.950
Dad decides home gone with oops.

386
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:05.350
Not feeling right then?

387
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.420
Simply right.

388
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.780
First off,

389
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.320
all returned.

390
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.660
None.

391
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:14.360
Then we have some more court in our previous thing.

392
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.090
That is Yeah.

393
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.760
This one.

394
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.970
That's it.

395
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:28.260
So let me simply first Apprendi work list off Tomcats.

396
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.380
No Mirandes.

397
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.430
So before going to run,

398
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.950
let me provide execution permission for this and run this court and see the output first.

399
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.950
Already we know this school.

400
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.300
I mean from your previous script,

401
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:42.480
right?

402
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:42.700
Yes.

403
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.160
You're getting too some guts that fight.

404
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.950
What I am doing is what all the information you are print finding previously,

405
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:50.170
Tom,

406
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:55.200
get home on Tomcat conflict Fight that information I'm finding in terms off objects.

407
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.130
Yes.

408
00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.350
So before going to create an absurd you should have a template for that.

409
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.050
So let me create a template called class from Cat.

410
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.390
Then let me read.

411
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.350
Simply object.

412
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.960
Then here I am writing a method call.

413
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.850
Good.

414
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.660
Who?

415
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.520
Corn fight.

416
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:15.950
That's it.

417
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.760
Self see,

418
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.730
you are goingto finally were Tomcat.

419
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.180
Whom?

420
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.710
From Surat XML file.

421
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.990
That's why you're expecting one variable for this.

422
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.350
Let's say I mean one argument lets us our XML then.

423
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.370
No,

424
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.760
I'm finding self taught.

425
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:41.070
Sell for dot Let's say home Tomcat whom equals to simply where's dot part dot dear your

426
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.450
name,

427
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:45.950
then ways dot part dirty our name.

428
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:55.410
Then you were server XML file then Self Lord Khan for file equals to simply your several

429
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.750
XML only that's it.

430
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.500
So you have it in a simple matter to find out they were time.

431
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:07.160
Get home on conflagration for Let me write one more method called display display details.

432
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.760
Self.

433
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.450
You don't need to get any values to display your details because you're already in the same

434
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.440
class.

435
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.200
That's what I looked like.

436
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.180
A night simply Pre Tomcat home,

437
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.040
off object.

438
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.460
You don't know how many objects you're having.

439
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:24.720
First,

440
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.260
we are assuming that for one object and we're creating a template.

441
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:38.890
So Tom get home is so I can write simply Self Lord Tom care whom then I'm printing.

442
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.840
Tom.

443
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.660
Get gone for file is Self Lord.

444
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.230
You were gone for file.

445
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.760
That's it.

446
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.550
Now let me write redone None.

447
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.310
That's fine,

448
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.020
guys,

449
00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.710
we help you did a template toe.

450
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.300
Get on,

451
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.720
get home and con file on.

452
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.110
If you have a information to print the details,

453
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.120
we have to define your method.

454
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.760
That's fine.

455
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.640
No,

456
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:07.950
si,

457
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.760
what I'm doing is.

458
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.200
I want to create dynamically number off objects.

459
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.080
But I don't know how many objects I want to create,

460
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.330
because if I have to,

461
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.820
dumb gets any to create two objects.

462
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.620
If I have 10 time,

463
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.160
gets any to create 10 objects.

464
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.430
That's why what I'm doing is I'm taking a variable called Tomcat.

465
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.950
Objects equals to empty.

466
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:35.050
Then for each in for each file in your list off Tomcats.

467
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.800
So for each file and integrate absurd.

468
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.400
So I'm creating simply tomcat.

469
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.450
Object equals two.

470
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.580
How do great.

471
00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:43.840
I'm good.

472
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.180
Absurd.

473
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.850
These this index right?

474
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.390
These this index Tom Care Yes,

475
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.210
I greater one time.

476
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:52.370
Good.

477
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.760
Absurd.

478
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.430
Late on for this time.

479
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.350
Get object.

480
00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.660
I am calling Get home confines.

481
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.440
So then,

482
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.440
for that I am passing.

483
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.200
You're each file each well in nothing but your configuration files in Luke configuration

484
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.460
file.

485
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:14.950
Just know we created for your first love for us to look first situation one time Get object

486
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.730
on this object.

487
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.110
I want to store in this list because they really I can't You name like Tom.

488
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.850
Get one time car to Tom Country because these dynamics skip.

489
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.420
You don't know how many time cause you're going to get on your host dynamically.

490
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.090
New to fetch.

491
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.950
That's why I'm creating a name called Tom.

492
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.610
Get object than this.

493
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:32.100
Absurd.

494
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.950
I am a pending into Tomcat objects.

495
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.850
Not a pain,

496
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.690
Tom.

497
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:39.990
Cut.

498
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.260
Object.

499
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.710
So what will happen by the completion of your look if you have some 10 Tomcats,

500
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.620
I'm intense Ordered XML files.

501
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.150
You're going to create 10 Tom,

502
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.120
get objects on you are writing each object you're storing into your tomcat objects.

503
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.660
That's it,

504
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.950
right?

505
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.310
Find Finally.

506
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:06.640
Just let me bring Tomcat objects and see that is there.

507
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:14.160
Just wait.

508
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.670
Can see that it?

509
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.790
Yes.

510
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.790
You're getting two objects,

511
00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.050
right?

512
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.510
See,

513
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.820
they're different objects.

514
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.080
No,

515
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.040
you know you know the hand you're having.

516
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.820
Some Tomcat officers know for each and every object I need to get the information.

517
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.850
Then just to call that particular object display details?

518
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:31.850
No.

519
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.930
See,

520
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.610
once again,

521
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:41.660
I'm using for loop on this Objects for each object in You were Tomcat objects.

522
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:47.310
Then let me called simply each object.

523
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.790
So each object maybe for stop just a second object or third object.

524
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.720
Whatever it may be in that we are calling display details.

525
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.260
That's it.

526
00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:00.450
That's it right now let me run and see the result.

527
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:09.160
What happened?

528
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.070
Yeah.

529
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.850
Bring spelling Mistake.

530
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:19.920
No.

531
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.500
See the output?

532
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:25.850
Yes,

533
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.350
you're getting I'm cut.

534
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.180
Seven Tomcat seven conflict fight time.

535
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:29.690
Get mine,

536
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.950
Tom Cotton in conflict file.

537
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.010
So,

538
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:32.250
guys,

539
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:32.520
here,

540
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.940
you need to understand that First,

541
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.360
Awful.

542
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.610
Based on your requirement,

543
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.550
create one template.

544
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.290
So from time,

545
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:39.640
very hard.

546
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.940
A great number of objects.

547
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.650
So before going to create objects,

548
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.390
number off objects,

549
00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.260
you have to know how many are just you want to create.

550
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.750
So our requirement these number of Tom gets,

551
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.070
That's why.

552
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.380
First,

553
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.910
I'm finding number off Tomcats from this function,

554
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.730
and I'm storing that in tow.

555
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.340
List off.

556
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.180
Tom Card's not based on this.

557
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.560
I need to create number of objects that dynamically.

558
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.710
I don't know how many objects I need to create in this.

559
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.230
We own number off our Tom gets.

560
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.460
That means we have to create them.

561
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.050
That many number of times are objects.

562
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.930
That's why for each file in this,

563
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.620
I'm creating your object first.

564
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.330
So by the completion of first generation,

565
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.870
you're going to get the information on board first Tomcat object that details.

566
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.050
I'm starting in the list.

567
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:22.820
That's it.

568
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.580
So that if we have some 100 Tom Carrots 100 object.

569
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.760
I'm soaring into this list.

570
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.500
It's object is having its one information right now.

571
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.210
Using for loop,

572
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.010
I'm taking one way one object and I am from that object.

573
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.690
I'm the calling display matter so that you're going to get the information about that

574
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:40.350
butler object.

575
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.540
So be clear while calling this matter.

576
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.020
We are not sending any information because already Well,

577
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.820
creating absurd in memory you got for each and every object.

578
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.890
This information on this metal is there from this class only that's why we told passing you

579
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.380
were information.

580
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:55.650
I mean,

581
00:25:55.650 --> 00:26:00.130
these two attributes are variables you can ableto print them from using this display

582
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.070
Details mattered.

583
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.210
So that is not one days for this concept.

584
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.950
Only I explained this much court.

585
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.130
Okay,

586
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.460
maybe this is lengthy explanation,

587
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.350
but suppose if you are new to oops concert,

588
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.220
this will be useful somewhat.

589
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.530
Okay,

590
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.880
so they just try to practice those two chords,

591
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.260
go with Sylvester here and here,

592
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.390
and try to understand what is that?

593
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.850
Burned Is here the only at one daisies.

594
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.300
When What If you're calling display details at that time?

595
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.430
You don't need to send See here in your normal functions while calling displayed It is.

596
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:39.620
What I'm doing is I'm sending my information right and I'm taking from there and I need to

597
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.750
follow key and then index values.

598
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.660
But a year?

599
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.800
No need to send the word objects information unknown.

600
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.190
You're not depending one index or key.

601
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.610
Definitely.

602
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.310
You're taking variables somewhat easy.

603
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.330
No goingto arrange your keys.

604
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:57.340
Noting toe Abdel,

605
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.550
your in explosions.

606
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.530
Right?

607
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.190
So he's from no one birds.

608
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:09.320
Even though if it is a some no one object required Try to create a class so that you will

609
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:14.260
get idea how to use classes so once if we do practice class is very simple.

610
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:21.050
There is a lot of hard one day with the class that one days are nothing but money to pass

611
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.170
your arguments.

612
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.160
You are variables to your method which is there in the class.

613
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.910
So one method objects or one method attributes are variables you can use in the other

614
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.550
method for their partner object.

615
00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.860
So that is that one day.

616
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.850
Okay.

617
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.880
Okay,

618
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.200
guys,

619
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.260
Thank you for watching this lengthy review for simple concert
