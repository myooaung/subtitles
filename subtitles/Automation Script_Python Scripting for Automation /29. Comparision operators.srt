1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230
prince.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,320
In our previous video,

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,550
we have seen about automatic and assignment operators off fightin.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,660
Now we're going to discuss about the next operator.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,590
That is,

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,400
combat ism or combat is an operative soft by time.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,150
Guys,

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,870
these operatives are very,

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,350
very important in your real time.

10
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,350
Compact isn't operatives.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,380
And one more point.

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,990
We already discussed that while giving introduction to operators that is comparison

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,100
operators.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,290
We take import as value right on.

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,050
Then it will you output as a Boolean value Brewer falls fight.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,950
She actually comparison is nothing about finding relation between two operates or values.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,070
I mean,

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,050
let's say he held three and four numbers.

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,250
No,

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,020
I'm going to check Krieger than for more false.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,240
No,

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,170
we know that three is not greater than four.

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,420
That's why this is a combat is no better here.

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,260
And if you come back,

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,000
these two with the help off this greater than symbol,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,730
right,

27
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,670
you're going to get result as false.

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,730
So we're providing input as a value number number,

29
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,490
system value,

30
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,290
right as off No,

31
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,490
on output.

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,790
You're going to get either pro or faults,

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,260
right?

34
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,370
Let me open my python personal so I can explain very easily.

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,370
from here as off?

36
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:23,490
No,

37
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,050
we're not going to write any bite on programmer script.

38
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,490
Let me take trigger than four.

39
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:28,930
No,

40
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,150
we know that false.

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,730
You guys wait.

42
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:37,850
Taking your comparison operators you can take a space are between your operates.

43
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,640
Now let me take three less than four.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,260
Yes,

45
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,740
we know which drew Exactly.

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,750
Even if you do with bite on your getting proof,

47
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,080
right?

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,250
So comparison operators are usedto find the relation between two values or two operations.

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,730
So,

50
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:54,960
guys,

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,570
I can also store my value in do some variable and no,

52
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,250
I'm taking three less than Yeah.

53
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,130
So what is the value for?

54
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,510
So python is going to compare,

55
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,150
like three less than four.

56
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,150
So internally you believe nothing for four.

57
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,000
So three less than four.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Yes,

59
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,870
it's true,

60
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,150
right?

61
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,720
Let me check it.

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,450
Yes,

63
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,650
so likewise you How different types off operatives here,

64
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,150
None of them less than double equal demons or other equipment's equality.

65
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,250
Not equal resident request less than our request.

66
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,910
Right?

67
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,520
See barbarically.

68
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,550
You can check suppose four less than recourse to four.

69
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,010
Actually,

70
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,080
the meaning for this is it may be less than or it may be equal if anyone off that is true.

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,960
Then you will get out.

72
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,630
But as a true I mean four,

73
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,120
maybe close to four.

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,480
Remember less than that.

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,070
So as off.

76
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,380
No,

77
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,660
in this relation for equals to four.

78
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,950
But you are taking either less than or equal to equal is correct that we're getting proof

79
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,320
are injured off that I'm taking three less than a week or so for yes,

80
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,000
anyone trees less than for true.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,550
Maybe anyone off that either less than or equal Mike.

82
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:16,230
So guys 11 more thing are using this comparison or relationship operators with the number

83
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,960
systems is very easy because we are very much familiar with the number systems from our

84
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,750
mathematics.

85
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,890
Apparently,

86
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,510
we can see by seeing your numbers two numbers to values.

87
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,620
You can tell the relationship between those two numbers either equal or not equal greater

88
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,880
than less than less than it cost to get down on the coast.

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,150
Right.

90
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,370
But when you go with the strings,

91
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:36,840
actually,

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,350
strength is also ah important while discussing about your comparison operators,

93
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,780
I mean,

94
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,250
how do come bar strings?

95
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,910
Let's say I have a string call earlier.

96
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,850
I want to come check this every A equals two year.

97
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,620
Yes,

98
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,130
it's true.

99
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,420
Yeah,

100
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,050
because Toby no.

101
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,360
These two things directly we can tell that Are you not equals to be?

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,820
Yes,

103
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,430
it's true.

104
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,520
They're not equal.

105
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,400
We're we're taking They are not equal.

106
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Yes.

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:05,950
True.

108
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,630
So equal,

109
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,040
Not equal We can easily understand because by seeing strings itself,

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,490
we can match And we can tell that whether they're equal,

111
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,170
not equal.

112
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,640
But what about this?

113
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,830
I'm building is less than B Yes,

114
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,750
it's true actually.

115
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,090
But if I run this yes,

116
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,820
You're going to get over as a true how How your pichon is going toe compatible strings What

117
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,750
is the mechanism while comparing your strings?

118
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,060
Nothing is their gaze Whenever If you're going toe company was springs your pipeline We

119
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,020
convert each and every character into an ass Keycorp based on aspic or it is going to

120
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,890
compare Let me find What is that asking court for you?

121
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,020
Are you see?

122
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,150
Go find for any character the asking core The default function is order Order off your

123
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,370
character Not only you can take any special character.

124
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,850
Also you're going to get some asking core.

125
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,210
No need to remember that but at least just try to remember the function.

126
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,840
See if I know.

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,590
Ask Accord.

128
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,350
Then how can I find character?

129
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,590
Let me ready 45 character.

130
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,350
See that you can find your character asking chord using order function.

131
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,350
You can find that the popular character from your ass kick or using car function.

132
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,890
That's fine.

133
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,340
No,

134
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,550
let me compare year.

135
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,490
Is it less?

136
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,890
Then be?

137
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,610
Yes,

138
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,950
obviously these?

139
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,910
No,

140
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,050
The reason he's whenever we fear multiple characters,

141
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,820
right?

142
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,950
The foster character from your left side string will be compared with the 1st 2 character

143
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,350
from your right side string.

144
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,790
So yea less than we we know that that right is true.

145
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,250
Let me take something like NBC and I'm going to take sick.

146
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,370
Otherwise I will take.

147
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,630
You are terribly Let's say C No,

148
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,840
the result is false.

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,600
The reason is first thing foster character from your left,

150
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,400
the side on first careful from your right side off your operator is yea,

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,080
both are equal.

152
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,430
That's right.

153
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,430
We'll skip that and we try to come back second.

154
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,150
The characters,

155
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,890
so be is greater than your right.

156
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,450
But you're taking less than that's why this is false,

157
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,960
right?

158
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,620
So it will combats character by character.

159
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,950
Any given strengths right?

160
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,300
Like we suppose if I do greater than symbol.

161
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,640
But it's true,

162
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,770
right?

163
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,270
So simply guys were Piketon will come.

164
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,290
Parry was strings based on and asking core.

165
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,690
So how to get your ass kicked?

166
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,770
Core is nothing but order off your popular character.

167
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,630
How do you get your character for your butler asking?

168
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,150
Call Cara function I So they This comparison operators are very,

169
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,290
very helpful while discussing conditional statements like if an if else else.

170
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,490
If Nessie lives right there,

171
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,750
we will use effectively dis comparison operators as off know what you have to remember is

172
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,980
comparison or relationship operators.

173
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:21,750
We take input as either number or a string on it will provide Allport as always.

174
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:28,700
Always output will be either Prue are false because you are comparing you are you are

175
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,950
checking the relation between two values.

176
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,350
That relation is like are they equal or they're not equal?

177
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,190
If anyone off that is greater than or less than less than our recourse to get it on

178
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,850
Articles two.

179
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,510
So you are taking relation ality between two values.

180
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,640
So that is nothing but output is always say,

181
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,850
the true or false are simply bullion or put.

182
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,750
Thank you.

183
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,940
Okay.

184
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,340
