1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,370
friends Here we are discussing a boat split Substitute substitute Ian operations off your

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,140
remodel.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,250
Let me weapon my fight on 10 mil on day I will explain.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,380
See anyway,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,250
they are very simple.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,470
Operations are combat.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:24,090
You're such ah match final find later that we opened my fight on treadmill on Let me import

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,930
Ari model.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,500
So first operation is suppose year we want to discuss aboard split operation And if you

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,300
remember why it's starting or regular expressions We have started with spirit operation

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,050
only I mean while giving collection.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,970
Anyway,

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,420
here I want to show you somewhat wants is in tax off your split operation So simply right

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,220
help body dot split operation and see the lizard You're getting some syntax right now.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,460
First,

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,950
let me take my stringers.

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:01:02,230
So this is about fight on on supposed Pattani's very easy and we are having Why don't you

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,510
wash in and fight on three?

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,670
What sense?

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,350
Yes,

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,990
I Jr that is this string Now Suppose I want to split the given string badly I'm spreading

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,180
so heals itself.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,150
I am writing a pattern.

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,580
Otherwise you can also write your pattern.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,150
Let let's say my partner has so I want to be wired My string wherever fight on is there

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,820
right now.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,550
Simply use our indoor sprint operation.

28
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,500
You are fired.

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,750
Run on your stream now See the result first,

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,540
See,

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,010
wherever Python is there,

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,370
this bit is happening.

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,750
But he had This is capital people right on.

34
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,900
But if you every year this is not simply python Fight on to one point on three.

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,580
No,

36
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,110
What I want to buoys very were fight on to our fight on three.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,150
And with Python,

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,150
then there I want to be a split.

39
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,920
Now you feel after your pattern is going to represent fight on by turn to on by country But

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,330
of course you're having capital P so that you can ignore by using by playing flags.

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:13,660
Now see that I am a playing your flags Case sensitivity flags equals two.

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,950
Don't consider case and study.

43
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,650
Ignore case since really know see the result.

44
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,440
Wherever python is there are right on to is there are fights on trees the their spirit is

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,010
happening.

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,950
Right?

47
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,030
So the only thing is you have to know how to write a partner where you want to split in

48
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,070
which places you want to split based on that's places,

49
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,480
you know,

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,750
right?

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,550
A pattern only We have gone through the rules to create your pattern.

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,860
And one more thing here if you have the year,

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,210
Max,

54
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,640
it's pretty.

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,470
Is also there right now.

56
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,050
Lady,

57
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,630
run this with Max.

58
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,380
Split as well.

59
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,720
Let me copy this.

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,310
That legal right or first time playing Maxie,

61
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,170
Split Jew and see the reason there is no change whether if you write Jerar,

62
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,530
I mean Max Pretty Jiro are if you neglect this option,

63
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,460
there is no change.

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,640
But if I write one Max is split spirit only in one place that go from left to right.

65
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,810
The first occurred place now speaking to places that to where you coming from?

66
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,390
Left to right.

67
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,260
This is left to right,

68
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,350
right left to right.

69
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,200
So there we were in two places.

70
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,240
Now see the result here and here it is splitting now here.

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,780
And this year it is not splitting.

72
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,440
So that is the simple operation.

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,010
By using your spirit operation right?

74
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,250
Then we hold substitute.

75
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,270
Now let me show you syntax for you.

76
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,030
Our substitute first.

77
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,290
See,

78
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,620
there is a patron.

79
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,360
I mean,

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,830
whatever the pattern you want in this pattern.

81
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,730
Whatever the word you want to replace,

82
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,550
then your strength.

83
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,640
Then come then,

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,670
flags anyway.

85
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,960
You know,

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,050
lasers are flags.

87
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,710
Let me write simply anybody.

88
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,430
How your pattern.

89
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,800
Right.

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,850
What is your pattern?

91
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,450
That Merrick.

92
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,840
Simply your pattern.

93
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,140
So bite onto three.

94
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,990
Right now,

95
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:08,300
what I'm doing is simply green Audie dark substitute in place off your patterns Bite on our

96
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,730
fight on to our fight on three I want to replace with suppose Jay Don when you were given

97
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,450
string See,

98
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:24,210
that is a wherever fight on is there there were replacing but here it is not replacing

99
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,500
because it is a capital P.

100
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:33,450
Then I play flags to ignore your case sensitivity now all places it is replacing.

101
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,940
But the thing is,

102
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,480
it is not going to disturb your original string.

103
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,160
Be clear,

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,750
You know the strength properties.

105
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,740
So in that case,

106
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,560
in case if you want to store the result,

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,000
then you can take my new string.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,810
I mean,

109
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,050
you can take any variable on in Vatican story.

110
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,730
No,

111
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,410
just a pretty.

112
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,820
You are new stream and see the result.

113
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,550
That's it,

114
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,370
right?

115
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,950
And if after your cone condiments you know how many places you want to replace.

116
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,720
Let moderately print by applying your count Calmed equals to Jiro.

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,850
See that put first.

118
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,940
There is no change when I But if you write Conte Kojiro are even if you skip that option.

119
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,050
County Costa Jiro.

120
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,150
But if you write county close to one,

121
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,090
see only the 1st 2 place where you are occurring.

122
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,550
Your pattern there is replacing with detente.

123
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,950
That's it.

124
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,890
But if right to see when I were afraid to do in two places replace my partner with the

125
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,880
required string.

126
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,410
This is your pattern on this is your required a string and replace with two places only.

127
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:42,950
That too,

128
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,830
from welcoming from left to right.

129
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,850
That is the difference.

130
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,760
We here and here it is replacing Not Then what about your substitute Ian operation?

131
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,630
You have one more operation,

132
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:53,840
right?

133
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,130
Nothing is that It's very simple.

134
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,110
Just let me run and see.

135
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,700
That is very it is going to show you your results.

136
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,300
As a couple,

137
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,770
I it is giving you a result of the string on here.

138
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,940
You're getting the value called to means in two places you are replacing anyway manually or

139
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,370
mentioning in two places replaced.

140
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,240
But you don't know in how many places you how you require pattern in a given string.

141
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,150
Just after that,

142
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,330
I'm going counter to you now,

143
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,440
wherever your pattern is there in all places,

144
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,710
you're going to replace with data.

145
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,850
But how many places you are you require partner and given string that it will do.

146
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,250
I'll see the results in four places.

147
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:33,570
Actually,

148
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,890
how you require pattern in a given string on it is replaced in four places with the J tone

149
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:38,890
.

150
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,440
That's it.

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
That's what it is giving.

152
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,050
So this value is not depending on your account value.

153
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,230
But if you write County Kazuto,

154
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,600
it will replace with only two.

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,250
That means you're going to get value to.

156
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,660
But if you don't use contraption in your substitute,

157
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,560
then in all the places it is going to replace,

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,740
But how many places it has been replaced?

159
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,450
That valley will be given by using substitute Ian operation off your body module.

160
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,750
That's it.

161
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,480
So,

162
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,840
guys,

163
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,290
these are the simple way to use your split sub shooter ends up shooting operations off the

164
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,460
model Very,

165
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,170
very useful.

166
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,950
Please try to do practice on this.

167
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,900
Okay,

168
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,120
guys,

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,260
thank you for watching this week
