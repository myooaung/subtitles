ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
friends.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.760
In our previous to you,

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.750
we have seen what is an exception on how to handle exceptions?

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.700
No.

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.540
Here we're going to see exception handling.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.880
For known exceptions known exception means suppose if you are able to predict or guess what

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.550
is the exception you're going to get for your core?

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.500
In that case,

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.550
you need to use like except exception as he and then only toe print your exception directly

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.550
.

11
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.960
You can handle that for them.

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.250
There is a simple syntax.

13
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.750
Nothing is that.

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.380
Let me do one thing.

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.650
I'm going to save our skip name as exception handling for known hosts.

16
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.000
So here it is that a script name?

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.450
Just update here like fine.

18
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.050
Know what I'm doing?

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.400
Yes.

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.750
First of all,

21
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.990
I'm trying to brain yet no.

22
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.670
See the result?

23
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.370
What you're getting name matter you're getting.

24
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.080
That means if you is no different,

25
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.820
you're going to get another called name era.

26
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.490
Let me know.

27
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.050
Don't know down them all off them.

28
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.850
Some of them not all at least some of them.

29
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.820
No,

30
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.840
I'm tryingto print four.

31
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.250
Place some strength.

32
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.550
It may be anything.

33
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.750
All right?

34
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.890
No.

35
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.410
See the result?

36
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.560
What?

37
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.900
You're getting paper unsupported operation operandi type because fring on number addition

38
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.630
is not possible,

39
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.940
right?

40
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.040
Not these one.

41
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.850
More exception.

42
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.590
No.

43
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.070
Suppose I'm trying to open a file called something dot txt?

44
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.570
Just for real purpose.

45
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.650
That is not there.

46
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.850
That's why what you're getting find not phoned earlier exception you're getting right.

47
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.890
Let me do one more thing,

48
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.080
I suppose.

49
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.970
Deedle Then what is the exceptional getting zero division ETA,

50
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.930
like weighs in every president practice,

51
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.460
you will come to know the list All for exceptions,

52
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.730
which you're going to get well,

53
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.650
running your script while writing your scripts.

54
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.450
That's why.

55
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.220
No,

56
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.760
First of all,

57
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.430
forget about all these exceptions.

58
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.060
Suppose guys,

59
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.270
What I'm doing is I'm trying to print honor.

60
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.750
Sorry.

61
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.720
A variable.

62
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.350
Yeah,

63
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.750
You're going to get an exception that way.

64
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.150
What I'm doing is I'm trying to print in this way,

65
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.270
but I suppose if I don't know what is that exception I'm going to get?

66
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.470
If he is not defined,

67
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.050
then I have handled in this way.

68
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:51.050
Right?

69
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.180
But suppose if I know if I know in case if he is not define what is the exception we're

70
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.350
going to get name it of light.

71
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.810
That's why you need a handle in this way.

72
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.150
That it looking right.

73
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.450
See that?

74
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.730
Name it.

75
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.080
Ah,

76
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.670
so while doing some action here in case you forget name,

77
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.020
name,

78
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.290
error.

79
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.010
What is the meaning for?

80
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.950
That variable is not defined.

81
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.250
That's a no.

82
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.410
Let me come in this line.

83
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.650
I'm trying to bring some four place.

84
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.450
Hi.

85
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.470
See that you go now,

86
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.570
an exception handling for this line This line is only available is not different than only

87
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.550
or handling your name at the exception.

88
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.050
But what about this one?

89
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.520
Somebody if you don't know what is the exception you're going to get for this type of case

90
00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:02.810
is what we will do You know you have a standard syntax except exception as he then print

91
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.480
your error.

92
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.720
No,

93
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.350
See the results,

94
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.710
guys,

95
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.700
You need to understand one thing here while exclusive exclusion off this block by block if

96
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.950
something goes wrong.

97
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.270
I mean,

98
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.000
if any exception occur on diff this exception matches with this,

99
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.990
then only this line will execute other ways.

100
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.920
You know this line is going to execute on here.

101
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.050
We are capturing that exception on we're printing that.

102
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:36.460
But we know that we know that I if addition off number and string.

103
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.140
If you're doing that is not possible at the time.

104
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.970
You're going to get type of the exception.

105
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.850
That's why I can handle logically in this way.

106
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.250
See that,

107
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.330
except paper.

108
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:57.650
Then I'm bringing hiring number on string is not possible.

109
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.170
Not one of your doing,

110
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.440
actually.

111
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.710
Right.

112
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.760
See,

113
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.830
that is a right.

114
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.230
Now,

115
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.450
let me come in this line.

116
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.050
Know what I'm doing is I'm trying to open your fight.

117
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.620
Some something.

118
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.950
Not our txt.

119
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.210
No,

120
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.370
see,

121
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.450
that isn't See,

122
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.550
guys where Nobody for trying to open this file.

123
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.570
Suppose as off.

124
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.710
No,

125
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.780
you don't know what is the exception you're going to get.

126
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.000
That's why this exception,

127
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.840
whatever the fighting,

128
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.250
is going to generate the exception for this line.

129
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.480
If that matches to with name arrived in this land leg school anyway,

130
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.160
that is not matching with this because it is only for name error.

131
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.790
But you're trying to open your fight on your bike.

132
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.360
General Dagon,

133
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.650
prior to check in a second.

134
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.830
Except no.

135
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.560
These notes not also these also not going to match with this paper.

136
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.870
Now your partner will try to go with the last exception.

137
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.660
What is a year except except for Nancy means in this case you are handling that you are

138
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.690
capturing the What is the exception you're going to get then print the than the showing

139
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.210
their something like Mrs No such file A territory.

140
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.680
But we know that when a But if you if you don't have any file And if you try to a weapon

141
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.560
that what is that stuff?

142
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.270
You're going to get file,

143
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.370
not form there.

144
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.180
Then I can handle in this way,

145
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.570
you know,

146
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.470
to follow any sequence.

147
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.850
We get it anywhere but before except except snazzy.

148
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.330
This is the last year or two,

149
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.730
right?

150
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.350
Okay,

151
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.440
then see there.

152
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.550
I'm writing here file not phone better than I am Printing.

153
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:32.040
Fighting is not present to open it.

154
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.750
That's it.

155
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.320
Not See the result,

156
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.150
right?

157
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.270
No.

158
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.850
Let me take one more thing.

159
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:46.260
Bring some number division with Jiro.

160
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.640
No.

161
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.030
See the desert days This is going to generate.

162
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.800
We know that as off know what is the utterly it is going to generate?

163
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.730
What is the exception?

164
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.250
Your Brighton is giving for this line.

165
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.020
Jiro Division Errol Exception.

166
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.210
But do you don't need an exception?

167
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.210
You're not handling here,

168
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.530
right?

169
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.550
There is no matching for this Jiro division here and here.

170
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.060
The only thing,

171
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.150
What is the exception handling you're having what I both existing you are getting that

172
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.370
we're capturing as year.

173
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.780
And then we're printing that error.

174
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.610
But if you are able to predict for this case,

175
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.050
if you are able to get I mean,

176
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.010
if you are able to predict dear ordinarily is going to be locker,

177
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.950
then what?

178
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.770
You will lose somewhere.

179
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.760
No need to follow any order.

180
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.950
But before this last except extraction as he You are right,

181
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.330
except judo division era.

182
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.750
Then I can say they resent with digital.

183
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:47.480
He's not possible.

184
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.610
That's it.

185
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.980
No,

186
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.620
See the result right now,

187
00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.350
what I'm doing is I'm trying to import some model cord import firebreak.

188
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.390
Let me come in the world.

189
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:11.050
Pretty west line import for brick.

190
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.290
No.

191
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.880
See the result.

192
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.860
Study what you are getting no model named Fabric.

193
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.850
This is a real name.

194
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.340
But what is the exception?

195
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:21.850
You're good day.

196
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:27.010
Just try in this way so that he can see because once If you practice then you can able to

197
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.750
remember that No module name.

198
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.560
Right model?

199
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.950
Not for never You're getting for this letter.

200
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.930
This is the exception.

201
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.430
No,

202
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.550
I can handle in this way.

203
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:43.950
Let me remove this line so somebody can like no need to follow any order.

204
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.000
Well,

205
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.810
handing your exceptions the only thing before this line.

206
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.310
If you're right,

207
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.220
then only that we legs good properly.

208
00:08:50.220 --> 00:09:19.280
Except what do not formed then I can write What happened then?

209
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:34.550
Print no module called fabric on the manger of this please install for break to use it.

210
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.550
That's it.

211
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.320
See,

212
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.550
there's a already are getting only this information now.

213
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.140
So that is first of all,

214
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.280
you know how to handle your exceptions.

215
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.850
Forget about all these things.

216
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.340
No,

217
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.250
simply you're going to see you are exception at out of here.

218
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.660
Let me run.

219
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.750
He can see the result,

220
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.750
right?

221
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:06.850
But if you're able to predict what type of acceptance you're going to get,

222
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.640
then you can write one by one before you were,

223
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:17.010
except exceptionals he in this way So that what will happen Whatever the line you are

224
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.680
excluding for that if there is a corresponding exception name here then that line on live

225
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.050
legs could on remaining all will skip right.

226
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.890
That's it on One more thing.

227
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.750
Let me enable this line now can you guess me?

228
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.880
What is the exception is going to explode?

229
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.150
No,

230
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.980
because you know whatever is there in Pride Block that will Friday.

231
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.850
It's good first.

232
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.940
Now,

233
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.370
as I know,

234
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.490
two lines are enabled.

235
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.600
It was Friday.

236
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.900
It's good this line in this line.

237
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.980
But while excluding firstly itself,

238
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.860
it is going to give an exception.

239
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.530
What is that exception yet is not different,

240
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.850
right?

241
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.070
That's why what you're going to get.

242
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.490
Name it a name.

243
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.950
And that's why whenever,

244
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.040
if you're trying to exclude any line on in case,

245
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.210
if there is any problem with that line than remaining all court,

246
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:09.830
which is there,

247
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.920
your prey block will stop on immediately.

248
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.390
With this exception your bite animal.

249
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.350
Try to look if there is any handling directly for that exception.

250
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.600
Yes,

251
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.700
some very whole name it.

252
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.620
That's why even though you have model,

253
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.400
not phoned exception as well.

254
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.940
But for very first line,

255
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.170
you have an exception.

256
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.300
That's why this will excuse.

257
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.220
But if I write this land first right now,

258
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.650
see the result you're going to get.

259
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.610
Please install fabric to use it.

260
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.700
You know why that is going to explode.

261
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.350
Line by line.

262
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:49.020
I'm trying to exert first this one with help off my block while excluding the here itself.

263
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.310
Your wedding at an exception,

264
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.710
that's why you're fighting is going to look for.

265
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.650
Is there any match for the butler exception?

266
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.600
If it is norther than different,

267
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.730
it will go do last except exception as he Then he replied,

268
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.150
Eggs Good.

269
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.550
That one.

270
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.540
And before that,

271
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.370
this one let me try to write print.

272
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.990
Ah,

273
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.050
this sees.

274
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.550
Try block.

275
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.300
Now we don't know any other with the 1st 2 prints.

276
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.620
Statement.

277
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.050
That's right is when the eggs good first.

278
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.110
Then while importing your far break,

279
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.190
there is a problem.

280
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.160
That's why I see this is Dr Block you're getting as it is,

281
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.460
because there is no problem with excluding this line.

282
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.780
There is a problem while excluding this line.

283
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.730
Then only or python will go.

284
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.320
Sorry,

285
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.530
your partner will stop the remaining logic,

286
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.150
which is there in your pride block.

287
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.300
Then we'll try to look for that particular exception.

288
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.860
If it is not able to find Butler exception,

289
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.150
then we'll try to exclude this one,

290
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.350
right?

291
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.530
Okay,

292
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.250
that's fine.

293
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.860
No,

294
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.330
finally.

295
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.440
You how nice.

296
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.150
This finally is an optional.

297
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.450
So,

298
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.380
like you accept this is also optional days.

299
00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.750
If you don't write these lines,

300
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.330
no problem,

301
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:00.620
right?

302
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.250
What will happen?

303
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.550
Only this land legs good.

304
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.800
If all these exceptions are not that,

305
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.080
then this land leg school,

306
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.450
right?

307
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.710
The same way for your try and accept you have finally block.

308
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.210
Also,

309
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.950
what will happen means Respert you off anyone off the elbow exceptions.

310
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.190
Finally,

311
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.740
your final logic will exclude.

312
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.750
So I am writing.

313
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.050
Finally,

314
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.050
this will execute,

315
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:30.750
not see the output What the world looks if you're going to get the meaning off Finally is

316
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:39.850
nothing but often trying with Brian accepted Block finally is going to exclude that it

317
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:45.560
right as have no title Remember the logic What happened if anybody for you If you include

318
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.380
finally while going forward we'll use in our courts.

319
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.250
The uses are finally as well,

320
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.850
right?

321
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:54.670
So,

322
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.090
guys,

323
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.660
now,

324
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.080
finally I'm going toe All right.

325
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.950
In this way simple way to handle your exceptions.

326
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:09.280
All right.

327
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.150
Suppose I'm trying to print any variable.

328
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.180
If the area is not defined,

329
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.350
then you will get an exception.

330
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.260
Just toe handle that because we don't know what is the exception we're going to get but

331
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:30.240
simply except exception as he then we're trying to print at a horizontal you're going to

332
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.540
get.

333
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.850
This is simple way just to handle your exceptions.

334
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.630
But if you know what are the exceptions,

335
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.450
you're going to get then economically handled with that exception name itself,

336
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:47.750
Except I already know what happened whenever it really is not defined.

337
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.120
Name,

338
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.040
matter exception will throw by your fighter.

339
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.540
Then I can.

340
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.150
I simply putting variable is not defined.

341
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.650
Nazi.

342
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.310
Likewise,

343
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.200
you can add any number of exceptions if you know right,

344
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.110
So something's what will happen.

345
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.980
What would the exceptions you're handling,

346
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.700
other than that you're fighting will generate X unknown exception under time?

347
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.380
To handle that,

348
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:23.870
you need to how final except as well except exception as he then try to print that he So

349
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.080
you married some hundreds off exceptions,

350
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.290
but maybe there is a chance to how to get unknown exception.

351
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.430
So at that time to handle that,

352
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.760
this is the exception handling case for unknown exceptions,

353
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.450
and this is like unknown exceptions.

354
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.600
Okay,

355
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.970
finally is also there,

356
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:43.370
right?

357
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.150
So simply what?

358
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.990
It what will happen whenever,

359
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.440
if ever,

360
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.950
if include finally so irrespective off your try and accept block Always it is going to

361
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.380
explode after accomplishing off,

362
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.720
your try are accepted.

363
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.150
Bloch finally will also in school.

364
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.690
So this will,

365
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:11.050
like scoot after trying with by on except the blocks that.

366
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.680
Okay,

367
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.100
so case as I know just remember this in Texas we'll use them well,

368
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.050
