ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
prince here.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.060
We're going to see how to run by transcript on your Windows operating system or on Lenox

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.750
operating system.

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.750
Right?

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.970
All right.

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.280
Now that UNIX like systems first,

7
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.050
let me go with Windows operating system.

8
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.140
So already we know from our previous videos how to run by transcript on your Windows

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.850
operating system.

10
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.840
And that,

11
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.030
too from common land based.

12
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.930
So if you want to run,

13
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.860
your python escaped from Do you ate this in de waiter itself?

14
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.650
You have an option to run your pie Transcript.

15
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.600
But first of all,

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.820
we are going with common line later.

17
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.960
Some offer some time.

18
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.960
We will see how to use by transcript inju waiters or how to run your python skirt.

19
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.160
Using your guowei.

20
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.950
Atticus,

21
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.360
for timing.

22
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.100
We're going to work with Trump Common Line.

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.150
Let me weapon my windows common line first.

24
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.990
So from our previous we just holiday,

25
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.770
we have some bite on Skip under this location.

26
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.080
Let me and into that and see some Biden skips or there let me take simply uses off.

27
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.430
Come,

28
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.940
let me take a simple example Our type simply.

29
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.350
Hello.

30
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.230
This is one fight on script,

31
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.550
right?

32
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.690
So if you want to run by turns scoop from windows.

33
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.040
First thing you have to check it.

34
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.810
Whether pie tone,

35
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.950
space hyphen iPhone Washington If it is working,

36
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.960
then directly Kandun fight on.

37
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.040
Then you're skip me sometimes if you don't fight on right,

38
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.410
let's say something like this.

39
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.860
And if it on so you get by.

40
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.520
Tony's not recognized as an internal external command,

41
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.990
of course,

42
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.250
are going some wrong name.

43
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.370
But sometimes if you run in this way fight on space I find even watching this command you

44
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.250
will get this output.

45
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.450
So at that time how you can run means nothing is there just simply provide complete part

46
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.350
off your python?

47
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.710
Very.

48
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.240
You install your fight under Dxy you let it out,

49
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.250
put or simply copied this part.

50
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.040
If you want to walk like this,

51
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.850
if you want to work like this water,

52
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.160
you harder.

53
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.650
Please.

54
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.970
Just to go to ur c right,

55
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.720
then death just to see local disk.

56
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.060
So very you install your python by 10 37 So here you help.

57
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.760
I don't write.

58
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.750
Copy this part copied this part and click on this PC properties.

59
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
So these only work with those guys.

60
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:50.650
Are you one system settings and environment variables,

61
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.460
but you can have this.

62
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.900
But so already I added that,

63
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.060
right?

64
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.650
That's why I only to add any extra part.

65
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.520
If you want to add once again,

66
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.450
you can add it.

67
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.920
This simply new in this week.

68
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.920
But I really we have that fight on 37 The simply I'm canceling so once.

69
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.550
If you are your party here,

70
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.590
then by re weapon in your eternal your python will work in this way fight on space high for

71
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.350
life in Washington.

72
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.490
So if you get in this But now we are ready to run your bite on Skip from your Windows

73
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.070
operating system from common line off your Windows operating system in this way,

74
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.550
simply bite on space.

75
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.650
You're right on script.

76
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.910
So that is very simple to run your bite on skip on your Windows operating system.

77
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.950
Let me take same python scripts where we have that and I'm going to copy this.

78
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.860
Do your UNIX like systems.

79
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.790
Now this is my UNIX like system.

80
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.660
Let's say see that what is my or burning system?

81
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.460
You name,

82
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.750
right?

83
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.700
Know what I'm doing is let me clearly hit also some python scripts.

84
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.090
So these my you know line,

85
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.780
X box 10 mil days.

86
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.940
Saudi.

87
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.750
What happened?

88
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.750
-

89
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:37.400
Bash

90
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.550
and Kim the AOL.

91
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.960
I'm not sure.

92
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.410
Way.

93
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.790
What?

94
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.250
What happened?

95
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.510
Nobody just know week.

96
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.750
It'll call by transcripts.

97
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.360
Let me enter into that.

98
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.090
So we don't have anything.

99
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.420
Let me create simply.

100
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.150
So there's just abducted whether we a is there or not.

101
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.420
Yes,

102
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.660
it is.

103
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.830
There really am.

104
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.700
Is there or not?

105
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.850
Both are there You can use either We a RV am aerators on your UNIX like systems.

106
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.610
Now I'm using via you because if you use we am no,

107
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.900
it will do some colors.

108
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.450
Simply I'm reading Hello,

109
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.930
world.

110
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.350
Not the way on something I'm pasting your lengths.

111
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.750
So why don't we help this court from your Windows operating system?

112
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.860
No.

113
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.750
Guys off the writing your fight on Skip Just take it whether you help fight on or not.

114
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.400
So simply python by the Ford You will get anyone off the fight on Washington.

115
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.470
UNIX like systems that are you feeling Python?

116
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.000
You're getting some $2.7.

117
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.580
Whatever.

118
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.450
It may be an abortion.

119
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.420
So already we know.

120
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.550
How do you sell fight on three annual UNIX like systems I already installed and we have one

121
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.150
video for that,

122
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.410
right?

123
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.170
Just go through that.

124
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.450
How to install your by country?

125
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.810
I No,

126
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.220
I want to run my python skip using fight on three simply by country space.

127
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.450
Your script name?

128
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.810
This is one way.

129
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.880
If you want to run your pie tone,

130
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.560
skip using python to simply piped on space Script Name Guys,

131
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.170
this is on your next like systems.

132
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.250
Don't get confused.

133
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.480
This is one way I mean the same way How you are running Europe Eitan skip on your windows

134
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.130
operating system.

135
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.540
So now as off No.

136
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.050
Whatever we discuss,

137
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.650
I mean to run your pipe landscape.

138
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.970
It is the common procedure on your windows as well as in.

139
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.950
It's like systems.

140
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.690
But you know what next?

141
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.290
Like system.

142
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.920
See how one extra proceeded also to run your fight on skips?

143
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.150
What is that means?

144
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.280
So before running your before writing your pie transcript Just check it.

145
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.150
Which bite on three you are having is the location by clubby there weapon He was script

146
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.020
Very first lane.

147
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.710
Just mention in this way hash exclamatory,

148
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.050
then your park where your fight on Is there after that?

149
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.540
After that?

150
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.820
Just to provide execution permission for your file.

151
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.090
Now you condone you're skipping this radar slash Hello,

152
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.810
World got people No need to provide fight on space because already inside off our script

153
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.640
the very first line we mention about python which bite on you want to use to run your

154
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.350
script,

155
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.050
you're getting what would know after your script.

156
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.030
All right,

157
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.980
so women sharing so you can mention what are the bite on?

158
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.830
You need to run your lines so I won't bite on three to run my core.

159
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.190
That's very,

160
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.540
very first line with this symbol has exclamatory.

161
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.820
I am mentioning my pie.

162
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.950
Tin pot on this line is score she bang line.

163
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:39.720
The purpose of this line is you are mentioning an interpreter which interpreter you're

164
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.750
going to use to run your python script.

165
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.650
That's it.

166
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:53.270
Like so if you want to use them any except other python which actually we mentioned some

167
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.660
default fight on abortion,

168
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.880
fight on worsening inside off your skip,

169
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.120
right,

170
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.950
like by country.

171
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.990
I don't want you spite on three.

172
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.340
I want to use python food than simply externally.

173
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.450
You can mention python and then you are Hello.

174
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.850
It will also works if you mention inside off your skin will take that one.

175
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.430
If we don't mention,

176
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.430
you can run from outside even though you feel how you mentioned from outside will take this

177
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.910
fight on.

178
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.350
That's it.

179
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.560
Okay,

180
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.100
so they on your UNIX like systems anyway,

181
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.020
you know the common procedure for your windows as well as Lennox.

182
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.070
Simply bite on required fight on,

183
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.350
then script name,

184
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.490
But on UNIX,

185
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.350
like systems,

186
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.610
this is the best of it.

187
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.970
That is first,

188
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.890
to find which bite on you want if you want to go with by done to just have type which fight

189
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.350
on or fight on three.

190
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.440
So whatever the path you're getting like,

191
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.200
let's say some script Hello dot be way so very first lane mention you,

192
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.450
uh,

193
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.770
which bite on three output that is location off.

194
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:06.150
Your fight on on this line is called She Bangs line.

195
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.250
Okay,

196
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.600
just come in that plane she wrangling.

197
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.950
So the purpose of she bangs Laney's,

198
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:24.910
which type off interpreter you're using to run the lanes we thought there in your cold lets

199
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.850
us simply print.

200
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.770
Hello.

201
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.200
This is also one simple by transcript just to display.

202
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.500
Hello.

203
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.450
So,

204
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.100
after this word,

205
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.770
your job is just to provide execution Permission for your file.

206
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.440
What are the Skippy?

207
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.670
Hold,

208
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.900
then?

209
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.260
Run!

210
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.350
Hello.

211
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.750
Not be.

212
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.950
Wait.

213
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.090
Okay.

214
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:46.610
So this year I am providing dot Slash Because I am running from the current location where

215
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.850
my python skip is there.

216
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.840
So here my python script is there.

217
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.620
That's why I am running in.

218
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.140
Dar slash.

219
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.490
Hello.

220
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.800
Suppose you are in the home location.

221
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.470
You are in a different location On your python skit,

222
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.660
please.

223
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.740
They're in a different location at the time.

224
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.820
If you want to run your pie Transcript from anyone off your part.

225
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.000
What you're doing is you're to provide complete,

226
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.360
but not so.

227
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.750
If you're in the location off where your fight on is there here?

228
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.250
We don't know why.

229
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.750
Done right.

230
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.930
If you don't help fight on scrip in this location,

231
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:27.300
then you are to run always your python skit by providing your complete park are just enter

232
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.430
into your required location.

233
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:37.090
Very all your python from there you can done simply dot slash like so there's this is the

234
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.590
way how you can run your python scripts on your windows on UNIX like systems.

235
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.550
Okay,

236
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.480
look again.

237
