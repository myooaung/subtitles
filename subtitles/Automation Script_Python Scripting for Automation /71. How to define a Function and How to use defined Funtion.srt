1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
friends here.

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,790
We're going to discuss about how to define a function on how to use our call or execute

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,190
defined function.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,760
Right?

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,450
Let me explain this with examples.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:26,490
So let me create a simple skip to define and to use your function so defined function dot b

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:26,910
Y.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,750
See that if you want to define a function,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,920
you have to use giver called the F With that keyword editor defined your function on any

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,570
days before going to work with the functions.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,530
Why we need a function whenever If you have a reputed to logic in your code in giraffe,

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,090
repeating your la Z in different places,

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,750
we are going to write that logic in one place and we're giving some name.

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,830
So giving name is nothing but defining the function right?

15
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,010
So I am defending simply display function.

16
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,650
That's it.

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,850
Imagine that I'm repeating two lines off court in different places.

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,160
Now,

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,510
instead of writing two lines off court in different places,

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,070
what I'm doing is those two lanes I'm writing here.

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,050
So this is first line,

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,650
just a solution.

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,350
This is secondly,

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,390
So these two lines I am reporting suppose in 10 places instead of repeating in 10 places.

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,460
I'm reading two lines here,

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,550
and I'm giving the name for that.

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,510
So this is a very hopeful,

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,460
defined a function.

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,750
You are to define your function with the f key word,

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,780
the off your function name,

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,550
then parentheses.

32
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,900
Offer that colon This actually you are defining for these two lines.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,890
You are giving one name call display.

34
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,550
That means these two lines are there on the display.

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,150
So whenever if you want to write some lines under your function,

36
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,720
you should provide some indentation or some space for all the world lanes which are there

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,640
under your function.

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,910
If we define any function without any line,

39
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,850
there is no use.

40
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,200
Right?

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,480
See that I'm different in this way you're fighting will give another.

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
What is that?

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,930
Another soon backs out of unexpected end off file while passing.

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,040
You don't know anything.

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,230
That's why it is giving another right.

46
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,850
You should How at least one line inside off your function?

47
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,780
No,

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,710
I hope to length no bowler.

49
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,080
Yes,

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,610
it's fine.

51
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,530
So I defined a function under that.

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,750
I'm running my python Skip,

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,550
you're not getting an output.

54
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,150
So when nobody for defending function,

55
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,300
it won't eggs goodbye itself If you want to run your pipes on function,

56
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,850
you should call somewhere.

57
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,250
So let's say I'm calling that function from six line display.

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,890
No,

59
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,690
let me run it.

60
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,740
Now you're going to get your two lines off.

61
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,300
Put so days whenever your pie Tony's running your court,

62
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,750
how it is going to run from top down.

63
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,000
So whenever it is coming from top down,

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,370
If python identify secured,

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,310
called the year,

66
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:19,110
then at that time your python won't execute this lousy simply really Remember the name off

67
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,150
your function name,

68
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,250
then it will come out from your function.

69
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,440
Then do you have any line here?

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
Mobile order Not only lying here now.

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,770
We have a line here,

72
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,090
but this line is display Ali fight on most that displays somewhere function.

73
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,380
That's why whenever displays there because already fight on knows that were displaced there

74
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:39,380
.

75
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,520
Now your fight on flew off control execution part will come to here and now let's go.

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,230
These two lines offer a completion of these two lines again will come to the same line,

77
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,700
become automatically so six line itself,

78
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,400
then will try to go to seventh line.

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,730
If you have any line here as of now.

80
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,690
I don't have any 17 Right?

81
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,750
So know what I'm doing is I'm going to call it once again.

82
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,850
See that?

83
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,950
So what you're doing,

84
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,140
you're calling forced your function.

85
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,630
Then you're coming back to here.

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,830
Only then you're going to 17.

87
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,450
17 again.

88
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,580
You're calling same function.

89
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,140
Then he will come back to yet Then it'll go.

90
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,160
Great land as often.

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,130
I don't have any eight line.

92
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,960
You see how it will?

93
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,530
It may be any line eight.

94
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's say I'm going to print now.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,450
We called display function to dance.

96
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,560
No.

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:34,960
Once again,

98
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,710
I'm going to call it.

99
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,940
Yes,

100
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,100
you can call it no problem.

101
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,260
Right.

102
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,090
So if I run my core foster thing very first line is a D off.

103
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,350
That's why fight on won't exclude this display function.

104
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,650
Simply really member than name Very or displays that.

105
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,820
Then you will come out from your function then is there anything here?

106
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,220
No,

107
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,210
he had displaced there.

108
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,910
Now you're right on.

109
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,150
We go to here and will execute that and we come back the same line.

110
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,500
That anyway,

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,190
don't have anything going is good in the same line.

112
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,710
Dental by.

113
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,690
Don't go to seventh line now again display this place a function now you're part time will

114
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,050
come to here and really exclude these two lines.

115
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,390
Then it will come back the same line.

116
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,650
Seventh lane as off.

117
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:10,830
No.

118
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,280
Once again,

119
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,540
you don't have anything to do on seventh line.

120
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,480
Then it will go to eight land and eighties A prince treatment.

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,450
It will print that line.

122
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,710
Then you will go to 19 nineties like any function Now you'll come to hear,

123
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,080
Reflects.

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,160
Could these two lines and we come back to here offer that I don't have any lines?

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,750
Then your pie transcript will stop.

126
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,220
No,

127
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,350
let me don't even see the output.

128
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,130
Not so there is.

129
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,760
There is a simple way to define your function on is the way how to call or exclude your

130
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,530
function.

131
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,240
Make sure that you're Brighton function won't takes good by itself.

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,150
If you want to exclude or use your function usual somewhere,

133
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,750
call that function in this way.

134
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,590
So I know What if your chortling your function your function name with parents sissy.

135
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,580
Hard to mention while defending your function before the EU function Name parentheses.

136
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,640
Colon under a function name with some indentation with some space.

137
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,550
You ought to mention some number off lines.

138
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,850
That's it.

139
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,460
Like no,

140
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,790
what?

141
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,250
I am doing injuries.

142
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,650
Forget about this lousy.

143
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,390
See,

144
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm going to define somewhere you're function simply display.

145
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:24,130
Bring welcome to functions.

146
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,760
Concept brained,

147
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,550
simple way toe define.

148
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,310
They were function right there,

149
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,680
honey.

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,950
Nor put no other Norwood.

151
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,350
So you just different the function.

152
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,130
So if you want to exclude that function,

153
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,050
you should call somewhere.

154
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,060
Yes,

155
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,650
I'm calling.

156
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,370
No,

157
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,480
it is excluding but injured off,

158
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,040
God willing,

159
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,640
your function from 90 line.

160
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm going to call it from very first line.

161
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,350
Then see the result what you're getting.

162
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,150
You're getting another call.

163
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,350
Name display is not defined.

164
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,240
Why you are getting this?

165
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,180
Adam means see your paternal Exclude your core line by line.

166
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,120
It will exit will write a good first line.

167
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,340
As I've known this play as of no,

168
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,730
you're right.

169
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,040
I don't know what is a display.

170
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,770
In case if we didn't contest the keyword first,

171
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,220
then your fight and understand that this place their function because off this helping

172
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,650
keyword.

173
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:26,490
But you define somewhere but before definition defining your function you're calling This

174
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,440
is not the correct way to define your function.

175
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,830
So always you should define your function First on after defining your function,

176
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,950
you have to call liver function.

177
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,080
So before calling your function somewhere,

178
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,550
you should define your function in your sequence.

179
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,750
Fine.

180
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,910
And it is a better practice to right at the end.

181
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,250
Return man as off No as off no return man.

182
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,920
See,

183
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,570
let me run it.

184
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,620
Is there any problem?

185
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,430
No problem.

186
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,510
It is working fine.

187
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,440
Even though you be included or not,

188
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,350
it's working fine.

189
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,190
So actually it is a good practice toe right at the end Off your function.

190
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,650
Return?

191
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,050
None.

192
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,610
So what is the use off that we'll discuss?

193
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,000
Where you going?

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,350
Forward,

195
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,850
Right.

196
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,890
Fine.

197
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,460
And it's one more thing While defending your function Name.

198
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:24,340
You have to follow some rules rules to define function Name So already we know that gays,

199
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,150
if you remember,

200
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:35,640
what are the rooster defined variables Variable name should How only hey does it or cattle

201
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:43,080
You does it then number 0 to 9 Under them Underscore only these three group off characters

202
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,550
you should have in a variable name now even function also same thing.

203
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:55,280
There is no difference The same rules which we hope to define a variable.

204
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,050
All rules are applicable to define your function.

205
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,510
That's it.

206
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,920
So capital letters with function name on smaller dysfunction.

207
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,750
Names are different.

208
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,350
Give since do we know that?

209
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,150
So I just tried to recollect the rules to defend the rebels.

210
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,580
Same variable name rules are applicable for your function as well,

211
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,780
right?

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,410
You should not start with any number.

213
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,150
You are variable.

214
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,040
Same here also functions or not.

215
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:31,180
Start with number but we can start with under school.

216
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,720
No problem.

217
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,750
Underscore letters,

218
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,840
characters and don't include any space.

219
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,250
That's what.

220
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,030
So these are the rules.

221
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,960
Exactly.

222
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,900
The variable rules are applicable even well defined in your function Name as well.

223
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,650
That's it.

224
00:09:48,650 --> 00:10:01,560
And finally So your function must to be defined before calling it.

225
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,020
See,

226
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,180
I am defending our very first year function.

227
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm calling a six lane.

228
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,250
Then there is no problem.

229
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,550
But if I call our function and very first line and if I defined this off function somewhere

230
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,700
in 10th or 11th somewhere well off that,

231
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,360
then it'll get a problem.

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,970
It will give.

233
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,850
It will give another.

234
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,150
That is not the correct way force to define your function.

235
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,130
Then somewhere you can call that right So,

236
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,540
guys,

237
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,950
once again this is a calling function and you're calling this This is a call function.

238
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,750
Call the function you're calling from here.

239
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,250
So of course,

240
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,050
both are same,

241
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,670
but because off this you're able to exclude this lines.

242
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,750
So this is calling.

243
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,150
This is called off function.

244
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,250
You don't remember this names as well And you can call your function any number of times in

245
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,450
your court like fine.

246
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,180
So finally,

247
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,350
I won't read you this definition Once again,

248
00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:00,660
their function is a block off court for some specific operation and functions are reusable

249
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:00,660
.

250
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,000
You can reuse your function called any number of times.

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,250
In your logic,

252
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,950
there is no restriction for that.

253
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,180
You can use that any number of times.

254
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,930
And one more thing,

255
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,370
it won't execute itself.

256
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,050
It will execute on Lee when it is called in this week.

257
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,030
You're calling from here.

258
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,150
This function will called.

259
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,830
So you don't know how this thing it won't exclude.

260
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,120
Right?

261
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,420
So let me save it underneath,

262
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,550
run down output.

263
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,940
But if I do,

264
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,750
if I call that in this way,

265
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,190
then only it is going to explode.

266
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,150
These two lines not sick.

267
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,200
So guys know.

268
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,170
Tell me why we need functions.

269
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,600
Why functions are required by functions are using in our core.

270
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,410
First thing is called reusable de purpose.

271
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,840
So we started our interaction collection of functions with this concept only whenever if

272
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,110
you're repeating your logic in different places.

273
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:00,560
So instead of repeating your lousy we are writing your logic in one place on we're calling

274
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,450
that in different places.

275
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,600
Then 2nd 1 is improved.

276
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,660
Modularity means see,

277
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,390
even though if you don't have any requirement with your functions in your court,

278
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,450
it's better to write people court in terms off functions.

279
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,740
Why?

280
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,850
Why means?

281
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:27,520
Just imagine that you're writing some thousands off lines 1000 lines of code,

282
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,050
your writing.

283
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,150
So if you don't know,

284
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,550
for instance,

285
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,850
concept what we will do,

286
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,400
Langdale and you will go on right.

287
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,650
Imagine that these 1st 24 letter for some specific purpose on next 200 lines are for some

288
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,550
special record Was no injured off writing straightforward.

289
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,510
If I use some name for this,

290
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,650
right,

291
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:54,880
If I do some name for your different lines what is the purpose off that lousy in future?

292
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,690
Easily I can understand What is the logic?

293
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,250
Your return?

294
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,500
Oh,

295
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,970
the big gold I can speak into some parts and each part.

296
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,450
I can write other separate function.

297
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:12,320
And finally I will call all the functions in one place so that the reliable devil increase

298
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,550
by seeing your core for your corpse.

299
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,090
Right?

300
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,890
So from no.

301
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,760
One Burt's even though you three days having only one lane off court,

302
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,750
try to write in dumps off functions so that you'll be good with functions off for some time

303
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,750
.

304
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:32,750
So from next class on words will try to write each and every core in terms off functions

305
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,200
only so that it will be good with functions.

306
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,630
Functions are very easy,

307
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:36,870
you know.

308
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,150
Need to warm worry much about your functions.

309
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,280
Mike then types off functions,

310
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,040
so there's basically there are two types of functions.

311
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,070
One is building functions.

312
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,170
Building functions means by default.

313
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:58,550
They are with your pipe on then user different functions means we are defining those

314
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,920
functions.

315
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,950
Just know we defined right we defend one function call display.

316
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,960
So if there is a function,

317
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,380
then only you can use it,

318
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,670
right?

319
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,220
Let me remove this function right.

320
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,960
What I'm doing is I'm running this.

321
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,050
You're going to get another record.

322
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,680
Displays not define because nowhere we define our function,

323
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,050
right?

324
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,090
No,

325
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,500
it is giving perfect output Same way,

326
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,400
I suppose.

327
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,500
A gender.

328
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,650
I'm reading some print lent off height.

329
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,900
You're getting to actually lend these a function.

330
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,650
We heard that in our core.

331
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,000
No,

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,250
but still it is working.

333
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,350
See if I remove this part This place not working right?

334
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:52,030
If I remove this part display is not working but lend nowhere.

335
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,450
We defined lend function but still we can able to use that.

336
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:01,600
So that means it is the default function with your pipe Thanh built in functions with your

337
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,280
bite on So for built in functions you don't need to worry that it look and use it not only

338
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,460
lend if you remember,

339
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:16,560
we have all suppose if I write exit course with some 40 then print ideal fix It is also one

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,850
building functions If they're pipe Town is going to give the other soft your variable.

341
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,750
Not only that,

342
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:32,310
let me take X equals two fight domestics,

343
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,150
right?

344
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,400
Then drink length off your ex not double.

345
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,350
And they're going to get lenders already defined.

346
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,920
Uh,

347
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,750
not only this We have so many functions we already seen.

348
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,510
Let let's say green minimum or fix What is the result?

349
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,830
Fight minimum ease of function here.

350
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:01,290
Bring maximum or fix maximum value among your values in next six.

351
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,150
So this all or some off the the fold functions with your pipe bomb.

352
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,720
Not only that,

353
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
Indian off X,

354
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:09,950
right?

355
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,320
I mean,

356
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
if you want to do some type conversion.

357
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,350
Waterboarding in B J list conversion bite was If I have it fight.

358
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,440
That is a string actually know what I'm doing is I'm trying to convert the art as a in

359
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,950
desert.

360
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,660
So indeed,

361
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,350
graphics.

362
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,110
Indeed.

363
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,050
It is a function here,

364
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,650
but there is a building function or default function with your pie tone.

365
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,460
Hi.

366
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:43,670
So you have two types of functions while on his user defined functions on one Moyes

367
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,660
building functions.

368
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,610
So really,

369
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,000
we used,

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,610
um,

371
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,170
built in functions.

372
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,670
But sometimes you are very important with your building functions,

373
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,780
with some with some functions,

374
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,940
some built in functions.

375
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,260
But most of the cases you're going to define your user defined functions,

376
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,620
right?

377
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,090
So now your concentration is how to define on the use and work with your user.

378
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,550
Different functions,

379
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,590
right?

380
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,970
So as off No,

381
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,350
we have seen simple way to define your function.

382
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,420
Right In next week we will see you detail with your functions.

383
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,160
How do you define an outdoor called with some arguments?

384
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,060
See,

385
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,750
display in parentis.

386
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,800
I'm not writing anything but in land timer hiding something.

387
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,580
So why should we write this?

388
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,450
So to understand this function,

389
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,590
you need to work with the U.

390
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,670
S.

391
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,680
User.

392
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,780
Different functions,

393
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,350
bypassing some value here so that you can understand effectively.

394
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,620
Why?

395
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,560
Length is required.

396
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,110
Some input,

397
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,550
Right?

398
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,970
Okay.

399
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,820
So far alluded to remember this.

400
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,090
How do you define a function?

401
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,270
No,

402
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,260
to call a function.

403
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,550
Right.

404
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,130
Okay.

405
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,370
Thank you for watching this.

406
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,650
Really?

407
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:55,990
You?
