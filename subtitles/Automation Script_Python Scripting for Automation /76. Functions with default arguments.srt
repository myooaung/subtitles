1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
friends here.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,510
We're going to discuss about the functions with the default arguments.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,850
Not to get clarity on your functions with the before door commands.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,400
Let me start with the functions with some arguments only we know how to pass an argument to

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,110
your function.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,820
Right?

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,570
Let me weapon my editor.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,800
Let me create a simple pie transcript.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,550
So I'm going to say with us functions with that default arguments.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,120
No,

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,970
I'm not going to read any value from Come and find you simply I'm writing badly.

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,720
Some values,

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,290
Let's say how simply a function called display on a gender.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,450
This is taking it any variable value.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,260
Oh,

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,370
argument,

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,140
right positional argument.

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,150
Let me print simply the value off.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,770
Okay,

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,890
he's just imprinting that value.

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,370
That's fine,

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,650
then simply I'm returning None,

23
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,760
right?

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,570
No days we have a simple function called display on.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,000
If I run that you're not getting in or put because you're not calling that now,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,850
let me call that.

27
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,090
But I'm calling that with value called full No,

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,750
See the results.

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,550
You can also call the dysfunction for any other value as well,

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,050
right?

31
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:24,690
But while calling be clear while calling in case if I not pass Any argument?

32
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,330
What is giving display?

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,420
Missing one required positional argument.

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,090
Actually,

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,050
if you have very here,

36
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,070
this is You're defined.

37
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,370
Function whenever.

38
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,150
If you want to call this function,

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,370
this function needs one argument.

40
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,950
But you're not passing from here,

41
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,020
right?

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,260
You're not passing that so if I know.

43
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,990
But if you're not pausing that you will get another like this No,

44
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,810
In case if you are not passing then I want to work with some default value.

45
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,820
If I passed,

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,100
my function has to take that pastor value.

47
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,720
In case if I'm not passing,

48
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,720
then my function has to work with some default value.

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,250
Let's say I'm taking you coast one.

50
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,150
Now you find a day goes toe one See that?

51
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,700
Let me say we can't done it.

52
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,320
You're not getting any better on the default value off years.

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,750
One right.

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,920
In case if you pass any value your yays taking that value injured off this a coast one,

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,310
right?

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,950
See,

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,030
in 59 I'm calling your function with the value called four right?

58
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,450
Then you evaluate getting for here after that,

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,040
Then second,

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,090
I'm calling same function with value for yes,

61
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,400
you're getting But I am not calling.

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm calling without any arguments.

63
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,250
Then it is getting default value called one that default value are given here.

64
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,850
So this is the way how you can be fined before value for your functions or default argument

65
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:50,850
.

66
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,670
Right now,

67
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,250
let me take one more function.

68
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,310
I will give this function as it is for your practice.

69
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,840
Let me define one more function or definition.

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,450
I had numbers dissolution.

71
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,500
So if you know the concept,

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,290
we're going forward.

73
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,550
You cannot play when nobody forget a situation like this.

74
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,460
So actually,

75
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm going to defend a function This function needs are two variables to arguments.

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,150
Let's say a comma be right on.

77
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:32,310
I want to find simply Result is nothing but a plus B on.

78
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,830
Let me simply print directly The result he's it would result.

79
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,470
That's fine.

80
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,200
Then finally let me our return.

81
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,080
None as off.

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,230
No,

83
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,150
I'm not expecting anything from my function.

84
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,010
No.

85
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,550
Let me call this function with values.

86
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,520
Yes,

87
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,050
it's working.

88
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,700
Mark.

89
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,970
I suppose I'm calling there without any arguments,

90
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,900
but you're getting another.

91
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,850
I suppose in my hand I have only one value.

92
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,140
Let's say fight.

93
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,550
I don't have second value.

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,160
Then we're getting another.

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,360
So what I'm doing is supposed for second value.

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,950
I'm giving a default value called one I don't see.

97
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,560
That is a but based on situation unity,

98
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,940
selective default value whenever.

99
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,450
If you're adding two numbers,

100
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,420
right?

101
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,070
But if we don't know second number,

102
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,950
what is the value you need to add for first number?

103
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,300
Generally,

104
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,670
Jiro.

105
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,660
That's why I can take here.

106
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:28,910
No,

107
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,250
Jiro.

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,870
So five alleged.

109
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,540
If I only or getting I'm calling this function with one value only.

110
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,690
But what about second value?

111
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,110
So if it is edition,

112
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,310
the second really should be Jiro.

113
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,490
If it is multiplication,

114
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,850
that second valley should be one.

115
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,130
So I mean is on your requirement.

116
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,550
You know the Celica default values,

117
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,590
right?

118
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,710
Maybe some crew fall some part.

119
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,350
Whatever it may be right.

120
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,840
So if you want to take border default values yes,

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,310
you can take it now See that I'm calling my function without any arguments.

122
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,880
If you're not having any arguments,

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,550
where is the result?

124
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,810
Always,

125
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,140
Jiro,

126
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,470
if you don't know anything digital,

127
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,550
suppose right.

128
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,770
But suppose if I give you only one or grin so one is deformed.

129
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,850
But what about first value in it to pass it.

130
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,900
I need to follow some simple rule here.

131
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:28,880
Suppose if I take a Kojiro and then be normally see that you are getting some error.

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Call syntax error,

133
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,490
but is non default.

134
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,650
Argument follows default argument.

135
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,680
That means always first unit.

136
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
In case if you have some default arguments,

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,900
you know to mention always your default arguments only at the end,

138
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,270
while defining your function inside off your parents is I should not,

139
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,500
right?

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,050
Like a course digital.

141
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,050
I would then be,

142
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,550
But I can write.

143
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,560
Yeah,

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,890
come on.

145
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,640
Because to do means default value.

146
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,300
Whatever you have,

147
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,430
you are right at the end.

148
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,750
In your definition,

149
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,380
that is the meaning off this error.

150
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,860
No.

151
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,150
See that it's working for him.

152
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,650
Okay,

153
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,240
So,

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,480
guys,

155
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,750
this is the way How you can be fine.

156
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,350
A default value.

157
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,450
Suppose I,

158
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:09,650
June?

159
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:09,970
Dad,

160
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,760
I'm going to work with some database.

161
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,940
Well,

162
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,580
I'm going to work with some operation on my Atlantic settler.

163
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,850
Let's say I need a user name for that.

164
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,250
Working some on on some operation on something,

165
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,380
right?

166
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,190
I need a user for their support.

167
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,640
If you don't pass any use or at least I want today Group has done my user working with

168
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,390
whatever they use,

169
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,700
are you?

170
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,050
How that's it?

171
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,400
There's these are just assumptions anywhere.

172
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,550
You will get full clarity while writing real time scripts.

173
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,840
So first we need to Lansing taxes.

174
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,050
That's what we are doing here.

175
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,920
So working on some most either What happened?

176
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,420
Rudy is not different.

177
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,710
Sorry.

178
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,390
This is string,

179
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,720
right?

180
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,770
That is not a variable.

181
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,430
That is a stream,

182
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,590
you know,

183
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,180
to mention inside of quotations working with root.

184
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,290
Suppose if I know what is the user I want to work.

185
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,310
Suppose I want to work with some web logic.

186
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,650
Could mean Let's everybody could be now it's working perfectly.

187
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,100
If you don't pass any user,

188
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,810
it will take root as that before user But if you pass,

189
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,180
it will take that pass user.

190
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,480
So that is the uses off before old arguments inside off your functions.

191
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
It's very,

192
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,350
very important case.

193
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,150
Okay,

194
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,250
just I do remember the syntax is how we are working with the default arguments.

195
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,650
That's it.

196
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,050
Okay.

197
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,810
Okay,

198
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,160
guys,

199
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,550
