00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.370
friends here,

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.410
we're going to discuss about six model.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.540
Basically,

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.230
it's This model is used to work with fight on run time environment.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.980
I mean,

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.900
while running your pipe and skip.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.050
If you want to interact with your pipes on interpreter,

8
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.250
then six Model is helpful place.

9
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.680
Generally,

10
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.410
people will get confused whenever if they are discussing aboard six model.

11
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.050
So generally six means we will feel it as a system.

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.220
Yes,

13
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.370
of course it is system,

14
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.950
but it is not your operating system.

15
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.670
Whenever.

16
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.850
If you're using six model in bite on,

17
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.350
it is helpful to get a bite on run time environment on your system,

18
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.610
not about your system.

19
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340
It is about fight under time.

20
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.850
Environment on your system,

21
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.190
right?

22
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.150
Fine.

23
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.250
No,

24
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.700
this system ordeal provides some functions and variables.

25
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.880
You know any model is probably always some functions,

26
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.710
and variables are simply some operations on these functions on the variables are used to

27
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.590
manipulate different parts off the bite on one time in Iran.

28
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.850
Man,

29
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.550
let's say you are using python three dot seminar Jiro.

30
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.850
To get that information,

31
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.130
you can use this model right.

32
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.140
You have different things.

33
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.250
I will show you one by one,

34
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.050
right simply assume that this is used to get 500 time in the Roman details.

35
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.790
Aren't we know that if you want to use any model,

36
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.770
not only says what is the first step you're to do always.

37
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.300
We have to import that on those list out all functions and variables and to get some

38
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.140
documentation,

39
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.280
these two are the helpful things The i r off your model will do the list.

40
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.630
Off operations are functions and variables on help.

41
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.850
Offices will do the complete documentation.

42
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.930
Right.

43
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.370
So we are at initial stage.

44
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.650
Let me open once again my python cardinal,

45
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.430
right,

46
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.850
By typing simply bite on,

47
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.670
Let me import says then the air off sis will do the list off operations or the functions

48
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.950
which are there with your cysts on the variables.

49
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.110
So by seeing all of these,

50
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.690
you can't understand which is a function which is available then how you can understand

51
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.950
that.

52
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.250
That's why you have a document here.

53
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.390
So initially your attention stays right.

54
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.310
That's why before going to use all these operations,

55
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.280
just have a glance once on your help.

56
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.050
Your document.

57
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.450
Just go through this start.

58
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.910
Go down Just having glands.

59
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.910
Don't try to learn,

60
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.930
then some very hope.

61
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.090
See functions like No,

62
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.150
these are the functions.

63
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.500
Let me go down.

64
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.860
Right.

65
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.710
It will take some time.

66
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.250
Just wait.

67
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.800
Let me go down.

68
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.630
Now you have a data that means whatever you hear,

69
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.180
they are like variables.

70
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.850
That's it.

71
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.940
Well,

72
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.410
you know,

73
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.800
if you want to use variable from any model you had to do,

74
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.350
simply supposed let me take one of the variable called black form.

75
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.160
So,

76
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.350
guys,

77
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.720
this is not a were operating system.

78
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.130
Details win 32.

79
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.850
It is.

80
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.860
You are fight on software which is install on your host as a little bit on windows.

81
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.880
I installed my Pythons affairs attack YouTube.

82
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.710
It frightens off.

83
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.950
That's it.

84
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.250
Let's say how one more variable called wash in,

85
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.150
right.

86
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.520
If it is a function,

87
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.850
not take parenthesis.

88
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.850
Fine.

89
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.150
Now let me open is simple script.

90
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.450
So let me open my stuff.

91
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.290
Blame text.

92
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.450
So I'm going to write a simple script using us this morning,

93
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.370
right?

94
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.750
So common lane or helpful to know your documentation,

95
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.550
Right?

96
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.290
But if you want to write the script just a just select any leader I'm selecting suppose

97
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.130
sibling text.

98
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.240
I'm going to work with the system model.

99
00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.110
So basics offices not be late so that I want to use this model.

100
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.090
Then what is the first of all?

101
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.550
I need to go import six model.

102
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.790
So you have seen What are the list off operations which are there with the hostess model by

103
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.450
running simply d a r off ur sister I So these are all the operations?

104
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.890
No.

105
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.480
Simple ding zi.

106
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.630
I want toe display the Washington off my fight on If you remember right,

107
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.820
you can find out that using your from common line you can done simply bite on space iPhone

108
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.820
,

109
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.220
iPhone worship Right on.

110
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.330
Previously,

111
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.530
we heard a discussion on platform model in platform models.

112
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.310
So you have one of the operation to get your piped on.

113
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.750
Russian.

114
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.650
Fine.

115
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.890
Forget about all those things.

116
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.050
Simply using six.

117
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.600
Also,

118
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.240
you can get your fight on and internment details.

119
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.490
That is simply says,

120
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.380
don't wash in.

121
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.960
I'm saving on running Sit output.

122
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.460
Yes,

123
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.480
you are getting I want to get in terms off a couple.

124
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.370
See that you're getting right.

125
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.750
So either wash in our Washington for both will give your fight on information details.

126
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.860
Then let me come in.

127
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.870
These two things these two are variables,

128
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.150
right?

129
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.250
I'm going to take some more variables.

130
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.480
Suppose I want to know the models,

131
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.450
which you import a two run your pie transcript.

132
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.550
So for that insists you have a modules.

133
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.910
Since not models will list out simply,

134
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.300
you're not going to use them.

135
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.060
But simply,

136
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.730
we are seeing how many models you are importing to run your by transcript.

137
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.260
As of now,

138
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.360
you are importing only six,

139
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.650
right?

140
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.950
But see the magic,

141
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.700
what you're getting.

142
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.280
See these all of the models,

143
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.290
different models you are importing to run your python script.

144
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.070
Actually,

145
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.020
you are not importing.

146
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.450
You are importing on leases that is there in the very first in output,

147
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.110
but remaining all models by default.

148
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.940
Your Piketon is important to run your python scripts by default.

149
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.350
Fight on is also importing some manuals.

150
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.380
So we are able to see that information with help offices.

151
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.040
That's why we're saying that sis is a modular to work with your python runtime minute on

152
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.350
men,

153
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.550
right?

154
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.650
Not only that,

155
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.470
let me take one more thing,

156
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.050
brain.

157
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.660
Since not but what is this?

158
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.450
Is that part first of the output?

159
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.190
You're getting some list off parts.

160
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.260
See while running your pie.

161
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.930
Transcript Your vital needs some libraries and models,

162
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.250
right?

163
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.450
All those libraries and models your python is importing from all these parts.

164
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.240
See,

165
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.930
not only here if you're good at the water,

166
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.090
any windows or UNIX like systems,

167
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.750
right?

168
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.110
C system is also depending on some parts.

169
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.530
So these are the parts your system is using.

170
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.890
Why learning some scripts are programs on your Windows operating system the same way Well

171
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.900
running by Transkei.

172
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.560
Python needs to some parts from Virginia.

173
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.950
It is importing some models.

174
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.330
It's a biting for python is importing some models no than from which location it has to

175
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.830
import.

176
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.270
That information is there.

177
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.300
Insist dark part.

178
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.870
Now,

179
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.830
simply you can say that sister part is a environment variable for you.

180
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.420
Our fight on use it He's on envy.

181
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.450
Known meant variable for fight on.

182
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.050
That's it.

183
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.760
Fine.

184
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.350
Okay,

185
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.910
so these all whatever we discuss just no right.

186
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.900
You may or may not use regularly in your real time,

187
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.300
but the next thing whatever.

188
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.150
I'm going to write that you are going to use it,

189
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.750
right?

190
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.560
What is that?

191
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.400
Just abd area.

192
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.380
So yeah,

193
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.060
I'm reading simply print Hello under skipper and see the output?

194
00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.440
Yes.

195
00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.300
You're getting your output.

196
00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.610
Hello.

197
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.310
Right now What I'm doing is before you were Hello,

198
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.650
I'm writing system nor exit.

199
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.080
Stop my python runtime in Iran.

200
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.150
May that means stop the script.

201
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.650
See that you're not getting anything because,

202
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.780
actually,

203
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.530
but nobody if you press control be or whenever.

204
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.210
If you run your script from common line Something like fight on your script name.

205
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.180
You are trying to run your pythons through.

206
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.300
But what I'm saying internally inside off your skip somewhere I'm saying Please stop my

207
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.950
python.

208
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.250
That is a meaning off sister exit.

209
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.750
So you are working with your python saying that stopped right on.

210
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.250
So you are stopping your running Python script,

211
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.650
right?

212
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.430
So because of this system exit,

213
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.950
your Buyten's is going to stop your run.

214
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.690
Stop!

215
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.610
You're running your pie.

216
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.150
Transcript.

217
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.300
That's why you are not able to get this or put by this line itself.

218
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.550
You're stopping Then you are not excluding this line.

219
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.680
Be clear.

220
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.790
It will be very useful.

221
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.500
While going forward,

222
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.420
I'll use in different scenarios this sister exit the simple meaning forces That exit is

223
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:11.200
whenever if your fight on identifies sister exit simply You are abrupt ing or stopping your

224
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.090
fight on script.

225
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.450
That's it.

226
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.690
Okay,

227
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.750
on this is a function.

228
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.180
So by default,

229
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.910
sister exit,

230
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.870
will you return Cora's zero?

231
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.110
If you want to provide any other than generating course,

232
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.650
you can pass your course here.

233
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.940
So how do you that courts We will see for timing.

234
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.580
Just assume that sister exit.

235
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:30.930
But we,

236
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.200
by default with the jury,

237
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.050
has returned court.

238
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.780
And if you want to provide any return course,

239
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.010
yes,

240
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.290
you can provide inside off your parentheses.

241
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.610
That's why it's his dart exit is a function.

242
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.300
Okay.

243
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.780
Okay,

244
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.150
guys,

245
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.610
thank you for watching this video.
