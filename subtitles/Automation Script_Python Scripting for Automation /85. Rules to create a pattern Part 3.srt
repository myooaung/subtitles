1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
friends.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,750
We have been working with the rules to create your pattern.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,860
Now,

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,150
already,

5
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,980
we have seen some of the rules to create your pattern.

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,310
Like these are the first to set rules to create your pattern on these are the second set

7
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,850
rules to create your pattern.

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,950
Now we're going to work with some rules.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,920
No,

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,590
Let me take the very first rule.

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,750
Is cuddly braces inside that some number?

12
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,450
So what is the meaning for?

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,930
This is exactly two times now.

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,520
Let me weapon,

15
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,820
miter toe Get clarity on this usage.

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,970
So how sailed this a script as rules three Not be.

17
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,620
By first of all,

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,550
let me import my Ari model.

19
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,210
No,

20
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,450
I just assumed that we have a text in this week.

21
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,630
This is it.

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,950
By tone and fight on three.

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,360
Just assume that now.

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,540
What is my requirement?

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,960
The supposed If I take my partners so as I'm using from no one worth,

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,450
Drawstring simply are Suppose if I try to look for fight on,

27
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,850
I would even let me remove this.

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,380
No,

29
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,130
let me print.

30
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,840
Oh,

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,630
you're already don't find all your partner in any given text.

32
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,060
No,

33
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,690
See the result.

34
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,250
You're getting fight on two times,

35
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,180
but in Python,

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,340
at the ending.

37
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,290
How yet?

38
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,220
Two times.

39
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,290
I want to get that.

40
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,370
So what I can do?

41
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:26,900
I can write.

42
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,800
And two times.

43
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,070
No,

44
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,990
I'm going to get there.

45
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,550
Yes.

46
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,750
Suppose I have a python?

47
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,380
Just some character four times.

48
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,470
Then I want to get this entire matching.

49
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,180
Then see that?

50
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,730
Suppose I want to look for a python?

51
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,610
Such there any is four times.

52
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,080
I won't look for a fight on word such that in these four times.

53
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,750
If it is a wordy should,

54
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,010
right,

55
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,550
slash B before I'm starting.

56
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,160
Do we have that?

57
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,760
No,

58
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,970
no.

59
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:02,030
Where we helped by tone with the billions were But we have a word with fight on and four

60
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,150
times they let me write in four times.

61
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,130
Now,

62
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,330
see,

63
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,430
that is a yes you are getting but actually here he and his four times No,

64
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,940
no need to write four times your Ian simply right.

65
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,750
Yen,

66
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,300
then four cuddly braces.

67
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,680
Now the meaningful disease.

68
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,400
Younis,

69
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,320
four times.

70
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,890
That's it.

71
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,250
Like ways.

72
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,070
You gonna play for any character?

73
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,420
Let's say suppose Let me come in this pattern I'm writing somewhere.

74
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,360
Suppose simply Yeah,

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,870
Yeah.

76
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,900
Then something.

77
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,750
Then in this way.

78
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,430
No.

79
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,890
Here also.

80
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,860
Suppose I help you?

81
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,880
Yes.

82
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,260
I assume that three times here You're also three times here now,

83
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,520
just based on our previous rules and current rules.

84
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,220
What I want to ease,

85
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,950
I want to get a word which consists off year three times.

86
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,320
Then first of all,

87
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,550
I'm trying to find the world.

88
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,050
And what if there is a worthy hard right slash beard of starting and started anything?

89
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,550
Then between that,

90
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,330
you're looking for a world called I don't get Yes,

91
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,650
you're getting that only one time you are having but the A's three times.

92
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:18,900
No.

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,370
Why should we write the A three times?

94
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,040
Simply color ta in square by curly braces.

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,150
You can also write three.

96
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,440
That's it.

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:40,390
Now I want to look for a word Such there Yea is 12345678 The world which is having the

98
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,790
world with year has eight times That's it.

99
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:51,090
I suppose sometimes you may house starting up with some exquisite No,

100
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,010
you don't know a word of it eight times you have a word with the X ray jet offer that eight

101
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,310
times.

102
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,250
Then before the what we help ex razor.

103
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,790
No.

104
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,690
See that pattern?

105
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:01,840
What?

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,950
Our taken exquisite offer that the eight times that type of war I want to find.

107
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,340
That's a so that is the use off.

108
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,150
Calibrates is with the number.

109
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,650
Then do come on four.

110
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,940
See here if if I write it to exactly two times if right to come before then whatever the

111
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,140
character before this Curly braces you how that character,

112
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,950
maybe two times or maybe three times or maybe four times.

113
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:37,360
See that what I'm let me take in new text I will do one thing.

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
I will come in this someone's let's say I have a text.

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,180
A call XY is a something x years there.

116
00:04:49,180 --> 00:05:10,310
Then let's say x you sometimes that then x 123 four Let me take three.

117
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,540
So it on the X let me take four times also noble.

118
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,040
Now our understanding is now I want to find a word such there The world should house

119
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,490
starting,

120
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,330
let raise X and in England reason site First,

121
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:26,700
let me read.

122
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,450
Pardon for that.

123
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,350
First of all,

124
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,460
I'm looking for a world,

125
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,080
that's why slash b slash b Starting on in English,

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,110
Travis Space on then my word should have starting later as the X and in England rest,

127
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,450
is it?

128
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,260
But between this,

129
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,240
I have a view.

130
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,110
No,

131
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,820
I need to look for a word such that it is exists.

132
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,460
Right?

133
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,050
Was Let me is such in this week Find all your apartment in your text.

134
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,570
Yes.

135
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,010
Excellent.

136
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:07,110
30 or getting no Might equipment These between these two characters you maybe one time are

137
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:15,750
two times or three times Then simply after year hard right one time are two times or three

138
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,850
times or four times That's it.

139
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:25,500
Mostly the result if he how x after the between these two characters If you're here one

140
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,170
time yes,

141
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:32,810
it is going to face their If he is two times it is trying to face that We heard that No,

142
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,070
here we help.

143
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,240
But hear this character is that character is two times now Let me remove one,

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,480
sir,

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,110
so that you can get that as well.

146
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,650
See that?

147
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,190
Nothing.

148
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,890
So that is the use off Your calibrates is so exactly for a number of times.

149
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,940
You convert to curly braces with that number.

150
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,480
Maybe one time for two times or three times before your character.

151
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,840
Sorry,

152
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,630
the character.

153
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,850
Whatever you are looking,

154
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,070
then after your character a hard right in college races to come on for two or three or four

155
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,650
times,

156
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,950
then you are more times.

157
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,310
I don't know how many times he's there between your two characters,

158
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:19,610
but I want to such minimum with the two letters minimum with the two times here and then

159
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,950
Maxim any number of times now see the result he had two times is there,

160
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,870
and here's some number of times.

161
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,400
Is there?

162
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,640
Yes,

163
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,050
some number of times is that all are going to fetch because two times or more than that

164
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:38,350
three times or four times or five times are in 20 times between You are here answered So

165
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,660
you were ex and said you're years maybe two times or three times or four times are

166
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,950
different number off times.

167
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,650
That's it.

168
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:53,450
Now bless one out of more see forgettable place from this conserved.

169
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,960
If I want to try to look for one or more times,

170
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:05,110
I cannot one come up in calibrates is see that my pattern ease.

171
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:16,640
I am writing my partners ex yea,

172
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,200
yea,

173
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,250
maybe one time or more than that,

174
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,480
then no see,

175
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,370
that is a You're going to get all the work words which are which are having between X and

176
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,750
30 years one comma,

177
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,750
curly braces with one comer.

178
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,790
But same thing.

179
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,030
You can also write simply by Pleiss guys,

180
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,820
whatever the symbol are using,

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm using here.

182
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,670
That is for you are previous character this year,

183
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,300
maybe one or more times.

184
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,880
Right?

185
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,570
Be clear,

186
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:58,160
yays One or more times That's a yeah,

187
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,420
is one or more times but same thing.

188
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:09,550
You can also write in this way also with that same No,

189
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,450
Joe are more pens.

190
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,650
See,

191
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,710
star means George more times.

192
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,450
Suppose if I take any word which is having its is a There is no year,

193
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,720
right as off No.

194
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,250
If I try to look with the x ray one comma,

195
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,960
curly braces or let me right.

196
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:35,080
Same thing with the place as well X you bless.

197
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,290
Is it?

198
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,030
Well,

199
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,150
see,

200
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,340
there is a same open but widened Cantonese between your ex answer.

201
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,950
You may or may not be.

202
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,570
Maybe George Times means there is no you are.

203
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,550
Maybe more than that.

204
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,690
I mean,

205
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,610
do your times are more than no more times?

206
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,360
Maybe one time,

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,500
two times three times or four times Then simply you can take year start now,

208
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,250
see the result.

209
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,050
You're going to get this matching as well for that.

210
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,800
So,

211
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,020
guys,

212
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,960
if I write in this way the possible patterns are exit because Tarmizi a maybe judo times or

213
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:24,940
may you are years one time are you are is two times or you were is three times like ways.

214
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,600
That is the meaning for star less means Except this first remaining all our for place.

215
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:40,050
Then the last one is once or none question more.

216
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:47,390
Maybe one time or none thing not for dear times are more than jail time or one time that is

217
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,350
four square records.

218
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,700
No see that Here he is there.

219
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,360
One time between X answered he had juror times is there But here we have multiple times.

220
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,570
But if I go with,

221
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,150
I'm creating part on us.

222
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,020
Drawstring he X Yeah,

223
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,220
question mark is there that may be juror times Our one time one or none?

224
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,670
That's it.

225
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:10,980
No,

226
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,140
see,

227
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,550
that is a which always having yea one time or gyrodynes those things we are getting.

228
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,290
That's a so the possible words for disease.

229
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,640
The X question mark means Gerard I'm zero times here said then x one time.

230
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,170
Maybe you that these two are the possible words.

231
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:32,370
No,

232
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,710
These two are these two words.

233
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,280
Are there any given text here in here?

234
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,810
So the threat is fetching them.

235
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,180
That's a right.

236
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,320
So waste these other some more simple tools to create your pattern.

237
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
And these are very,

238
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,150
very important.

239
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:55,320
See what our the rule we have here on this rule we are using in your pattern.

240
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,500
But make sure that whenever if you're playing this rules,

241
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,550
these rules are applicable for your particular character,

242
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,160
not for your entire words.

243
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,280
Yeah,

244
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,540
I'm using for year this question.

245
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,110
What means?

246
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,860
This symbol?

247
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,710
This rule is applicable for this year somewhere.

248
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,330
Suppose we usually hear cuddly braces for now,

249
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,450
for this year,

250
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,110
Not for your entire work.

251
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,670
Be clear.

252
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,960
Not for your entire world.

253
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,650
This is for only your character.

254
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,350
You are playing this concept,

255
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,550
right?

256
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,210
Okay.

257
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,850
Thank you for watching this with you.
