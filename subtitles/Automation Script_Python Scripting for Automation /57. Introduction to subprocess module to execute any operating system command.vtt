00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
prince year.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.550
We're going to discuss a bold sub process model.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.290
So this is a process model is a default model with your python,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.970
and you're going to use this A process model?

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.510
Just we exclude your operating system commands.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.650
You can exclude any off your command.

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.640
I mean,

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.940
from your operating system on before coming to your so processes.

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.340
Actually,

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.150
if you remember,

11
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.410
we already discussion one of the model called Wears to.

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.450
Somewhere on in this we have a one off the operation or function called ways door system.

13
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.850
Just to execute You were comments off your operating system,

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.190
right?

15
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.670
Yes.

16
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.000
Fine.

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
You're able to get some output for you.

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.550
You are common.

19
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.640
Know what I'm doing is I want to store this output.

20
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.450
India variable.

21
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.480
See?

22
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.970
You know suppose if X equals to fight right?

23
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.050
Why you coast to express to I'm doing?

24
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.590
Then we will lose seven.

25
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.500
I mean,

26
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.850
it may be any operation that is only considering the some variable the same way.

27
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.470
What I'm doing is this expression output I want to store in tow.

28
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.880
Variable called out.

29
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.050
Suppose only for younger.

30
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.630
See your python.

31
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.850
Kunar able to store you were boys not system command output India variable called.

32
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.200
Oh,

33
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.170
it is not storing,

34
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.600
actually.

35
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880
Right,

36
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.650
then Want it stored in your out?

37
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.300
See,

38
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.720
that is there.

39
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.250
They're getting deal.

40
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.840
No,

41
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.900
let me run One more invalid comer on.

42
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.470
Let me know.

43
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.730
See,

44
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.700
What is the value one?

45
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.610
I simply ways dot system will directly run your common on the only the exit straight of

46
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.920
soft you are common.

47
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.460
I mean,

48
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.870
whether your command was successfully Iran or not,

49
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.920
that status will store and be available.

50
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.080
But number if you are saying this output in the available So if this out variable believe

51
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.230
digital means whatever the command you are running,

52
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.250
that was success.

53
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.470
If this out variable value is non zero than your command was failing to see that previously

54
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.390
you got OTA's Jiro on.

55
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.210
If you have a here,

56
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.880
you got some Oh,

57
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.250
poor.

58
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.310
That means you're coming with success are from your own variable.

59
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.250
You can say that command was success.

60
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.780
No,

61
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.490
same thing I'm running in a different common.

62
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.570
See,

63
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.600
that different comer on this status was frail.

64
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.940
Actually,

65
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.020
you can see this information also here but by from your variable also,

66
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.580
you can take it if your value is non zero.

67
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400
You can say that your comment was failed.

68
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.680
Night.

69
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.510
Fine.

70
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.800
So finally,

71
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.630
using your ways door system,

72
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.940
some common you could not store,

73
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.700
you're not able to store your on putting the A variable.

74
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.190
That's why we are going to enter into so process model.

75
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.870
Of course,

76
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.200
you are also having one off the operation from your waist module two story or put in the

77
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.650
available But that is not a good practice.

78
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.890
So in the latest washings off your bite on some processes the popular one to excuse your

79
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.940
commands and to store the output in the variable right?

80
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.710
So before going to execute,

81
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.010
let me do some setbacks for their.

82
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.240
So there's if you want to use.

83
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.340
You were so process faster for unity import that you don't need to worry about whether it

84
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.170
is there are not bite afford it is there with your python It maybe bite on three out.

85
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.750
Fight on two,

86
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.090
right?

87
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.650
Fine.

88
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.320
Let me do some standards,

89
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.920
Index guys,

90
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.010
if you follow this impacts,

91
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.600
it is very easy to understand and to exclude your commands using yourself.

92
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.990
Process model off your pitre,

93
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.340
but is SP You can take any variable.

94
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.280
I'm taking its peak.

95
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.310
Right?

96
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.290
First of the listen,

97
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.700
Tex.

98
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.850
So process not the weapon.

99
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.790
Common Shelly caused Uproar falls.

100
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.900
We'll take anyone over there,

101
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.760
right?

102
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.250
Fine.

103
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.400
Then see,

104
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.210
sometimes you may get your output right.

105
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.060
So that output I want to store into SP variable.

106
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.490
So for that you have to mention pipeline symbol as your Lennox coming then STD Editor,

107
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.040
Let me write STD error.

108
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:07.300
Also I want to store into we were SP variable only that's why mentioning good for both.

109
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.240
I'm writing simply so process that fight the meaning for the days.

110
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.210
What our the output you're getting that are.

111
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.950
But we're going to store into this variable,

112
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.790
right?

113
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.350
Yeah.

114
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.990
Find No.

115
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.550
These are simply common to exclude You are,

116
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.950
ah operating system command with help off your python.

117
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.850
So this after running your command trousseau process,

118
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.140
it may take some time to exclude your command.

119
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.940
That's why immediately want you have to do is you have to wait some time so sp dot right?

120
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.140
So that we are fighting will take care How much time you want to wait to complete your

121
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.550
common right on This is common is also going to give you some Britain Corp.

122
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.230
What is that?

123
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.090
Record means just simply status.

124
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.750
Whether you're coming with success or not.

125
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.120
If you don't want to capture the origin,

126
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.450
Cordy,

127
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.990
no problem.

128
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.070
Simply cannot respect out.

129
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.450
Wait,

130
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.070
But if you want to capture yes,

131
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.000
you can capture by assigning.

132
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.190
That s p dot Wait.

133
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.420
Output in the available called RC.

134
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.240
You can take any variable I'm taking here.

135
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.790
Or see right?

136
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.900
Fine.

137
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.450
No.

138
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.890
Nice to be clear.

139
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.500
See here.

140
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.350
Dizzy just to exclude your command.

141
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.000
So we are passing or commando.

142
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.780
This is a process that you open or process will open on to exclude your comer.

143
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.250
And after giving these it medics sometimes upto that in a debate.

144
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.980
But you don't worry how much time you want to wait.

145
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.050
Brighton will take care by simply running this line.

146
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.250
Sp not wait.

147
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.150
So this is not right.

148
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.830
Also will give some Britain core based on whether your command was successful failed which

149
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.420
was running in your previous line.

150
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.500
If you are reading gory Jiro means your commander success here.

151
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.980
If the value is non zero,

152
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.350
your command was fail here.

153
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.250
Right Fine.

154
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:02.140
Now see whether you're going to get estudio out RST vieira because sometimes If your

155
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.420
command was perfect,

156
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.670
then you will get some output.

157
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.980
If your command was frail,

158
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.950
you'll get some better.

159
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.700
So both are storing into this SP variable.

160
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.070
Only now I need to separate them.

161
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.450
So for that you can take any variable like out on error or simply out on other.

162
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.420
These are variables you can take anything s p dot Communicated the syntax just to separate

163
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.020
your output.

164
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.530
Another.

165
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.250
This output is a like a couple.

166
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.530
So you know,

167
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.150
already we have seen somewhere,

168
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.020
right?

169
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.970
If that will consist off two values,

170
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.450
you concurrently assigned those two values to to wearables.

171
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.800
So this output is going Tokyo.

172
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.280
I mean,

173
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.010
SPDR Communique is going to you are put first comma error and that as a couple.

174
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.780
So I'm ascending that output into two variables right on.

175
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.690
You can finally.

176
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.110
If you want to see your poor Deegan,

177
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.770
print your out and you can also print.

178
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.390
You are and a like So this is the standard syntax.

179
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.800
First of all to work with.

180
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.880
Let me right output ease.

181
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.770
I'm using your strings on sandy batteries.

182
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.350
Right.

183
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.190
So first of all the syntax to use yourself process.

184
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.310
But here you need to remember some points.

185
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.690
What are the points?

186
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.650
Means guys here our then Shelly Coastal.

187
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.540
True or false?

188
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.150
Right?

189
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.990
See,

190
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:35.910
suppose if you take Shelly cause through our if your command is a directly the command as

191
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.330
you are in a collect system sort of Windows command.

192
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.210
I mean,

193
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.550
suppose if you take the air comment,

194
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.210
I'm giving as a string.

195
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.170
I'll let me take one more comer.

196
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.700
Suppose from UNIX like systems ls iPhone LRT.

197
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.750
These are commonly see I want to take command as a string.

198
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.650
Yes,

199
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.320
you can take it.

200
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.920
If you take command as a string,

201
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.430
then you had to mention shell equals to prove Shelly Coaster.

202
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.750
Prue means you're going to run your commands as a tease without any modification.

203
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.150
And when nobody particular command as a these right,

204
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.500
your pipeline is going toe weapon,

205
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.450
new shell,

206
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:21.150
new shell off your operating system and in that it is going to exclude your comments.

207
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.900
Right.

208
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.010
But in case if it actually cost to false,

209
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.150
if you take Shelly cause toe falls,

210
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.090
then your command would be like a list you are.

211
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.470
So suppose if your command is ls siphon LRT,

212
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.470
then just simply run unless I've been allotted dot Split cooperation with the before its

213
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:40.940
operative.

214
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.500
I mean,

215
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.200
you're right.

216
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.700
Commanders A in this week.

217
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.930
Not as a list yard ready of Shelly coastal falls,

218
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.450
but remaining steps are same.

219
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.560
The only thing if you're commanding the string yard racially coastal route if your command

220
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.050
is a list,

221
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.230
you're ready or Schellas False.

222
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.710
So what is the difference?

223
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.240
What is that?

224
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.070
One day when you are a picture Alekos true.

225
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.720
And when you are textually cause to false,

226
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.350
we'll see step by step.

227
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.550
First of all,

228
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.350
I'm going to a weapon.

229
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.450
My UNIX books.

230
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.460
Same thing you condone on your nose as well,

231
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:11.950
right?

232
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.950
So suppose if I don't let siphon alerted This is the output you're getting right.

233
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.350
So I'm going to write a bite on Skip.

234
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.350
Let me right.

235
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.200
Execute commands not be white.

236
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.190
So simply,

237
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.000
I'm going to be imports a process.

238
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.900
Okay?

239
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:43.040
Subversion that I want to run a commander col unless iPhone LRT I find then immediately

240
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.240
hard.

241
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.670
Today,

242
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:50.380
some process equals to this index just to copy and Mr All right.

243
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.430
Only thing is you need to concentrate on the war.

244
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.250
Shelly Coastal.

245
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.050
True or false?

246
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.400
As off.

247
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:55.580
No,

248
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.060
you have to write.

249
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.790
Your shell is a two because you are mentioning your common like a string you get first.

250
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.600
Observe this then after this right,

251
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.300
You have to wait some time off course unless I find a lot is going to give it or put

252
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:09.930
immediately.

253
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.670
But sometimes suppose if you're using such commands in your so process,

254
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.020
it may take some time to Canada.

255
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.480
The remotes are born to get response Stop!

256
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.940
Totally auto weight that way rt return cold rrc What?

257
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.950
Maybe you can take anything.

258
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.450
Espen not wait,

259
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.440
right?

260
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.310
No,

261
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:34.200
After that offer that synthetically I can get my out put on letter in this way,

262
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.610
right sp dot Communicate No,

263
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:54.470
let me print return court All I want to print I suppose the written core his RC What we are

264
00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:06.640
taking your RC That's it Then let me print The output is let me print Opas I want to bring

265
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.980
your put in next line because you're going to get multiple lines,

266
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.240
right?

267
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.370
That for what I'm doing is I'm giving slash and here so that Europe will bring in the next

268
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:22.180
lane love the same way in which you how you are about put spring the same way I want to

269
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.650
print the other.

270
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.690
So here also,

271
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.150
I want to print my error in the next line.

272
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.400
Sorry,

273
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.350
this is the other night.

274
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.860
That's a nice,

275
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.990
simple way to run your comments.

276
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.200
Using your spite on.

277
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.450
Let me save it and run it.

278
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.950
So I'm going to run this using fight on three.

279
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.150
See,

280
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.060
written Cory Jiro.

281
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.950
That means you can assume that by seeing this your command was success then the output.

282
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.280
You're getting something,

283
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.030
something right?

284
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.060
But if you observed there is a bee's there,

285
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.890
that means he's there.

286
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.600
Bite court,

287
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.860
not your normal string.

288
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.950
Of course you're able to see your data but your python is treating this as a bite object by

289
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.350
court.

290
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.430
Now,

291
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.230
if you want to get your put out their string right,

292
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.760
you need to lose some extra modification.

293
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.230
I will show you that I don't see that the era there is no error.

294
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:20.090
Air is empty right There is also by court but their results in theories The reason is your

295
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.100
commander you such a snow then ladies Noida,

296
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:31.040
let me learn same scape with invalid common Let let's say commander,

297
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:40.130
suppose something like this and I'm running and see the results written core 1 to 7.

298
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.500
Non geo means your command was failed.

299
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.910
And that's why you're not getting in output.

300
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.750
But now you have a some error that batteries this command,

301
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.650
not phone.

302
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.150
That's it.

303
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.890
Right?

304
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.680
Fine.

305
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.360
Now,

306
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.670
actually,

307
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.510
you're getting your open as a bite my court.

308
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.230
Just to avoid that,

309
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.040
if you want to get your put as a string,

310
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:08.650
what you're to write these universal new lines equals to prove your how dimension.

311
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:17.750
Let me copy this index so that I will are this Let me write the valid common first.

312
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.760
No,

313
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.420
maybe about it.

314
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.270
Come on or in.

315
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:20.720
Welcome.

316
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.470
And you will get a Their output are error as a bite.

317
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.950
Now you're going to get your foot in terms off a string.

318
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.300
So if you give your horrible as a string,

319
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.350
then there is that wanted to see that.

320
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.490
Now,

321
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.380
this is a string you can check,

322
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.050
even type off your output.

323
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.030
But these multiple lines,

324
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.250
right?

325
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.090
Not this multiple lines.

326
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.680
I want to come.

327
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.650
But as a list,

328
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.550
right?

329
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.430
See,

330
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.420
what I'm doing is yeah,

331
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.550
one more thing like me,

332
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.310
right?

333
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.670
That so you know what is the purpose off you.

334
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.110
Sorry.

335
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.810
Not this right One second.

336
00:13:54.810 --> 00:14:03.350
Not okay.

337
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.820
Okay,

338
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.150
fine.

339
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.040
No see,

340
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.420
guys,

341
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.530
what I'm doing is I want to print your port by splitting based on new line.

342
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.820
No.

343
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.320
See the result These very,

344
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.250
very useful days.

345
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:23.680
Why it is useful if you will see speak lines with the slash in same way.

346
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680
I want toe split.

347
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:31.450
Your erasable split lines slash in.

348
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.450
This would help you while working with your real time scenarios.

349
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.740
I'll see the result.

350
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.410
What you're getting.

351
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:44.800
Woman invalid backslash or split lengths?

352
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.350
Yeah.

353
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.800
Study split lenses.

354
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.290
Beautiful.

355
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.060
Going to spit based on slash and no need to provide any.

356
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.250
It's my mistake.

357
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.630
Right?

358
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.230
Fine.

359
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.960
Split lanes.

360
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.130
I want to split my lines that we see the result.

361
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.740
You're getting your own food as a list.

362
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.350
Now I know what If you get your own food as a list,

363
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.440
you have become what he wrote.

364
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.050
Whereas the list whenever if it is required,

365
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.060
other way simply,

366
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.250
you can print your output simply by print output,

367
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.150
but sometimes you need to work on each and every line.

368
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.160
So at that time,

369
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.040
what we lose first will convert or putting the list.

370
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:20.900
You know,

371
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.400
If you have a list off values,

372
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.450
you can take one by one.

373
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.250
Right?

374
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.180
You can take one by one.

375
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.720
Weaken.

376
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.250
Grab your information from that.

377
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:33.060
So just assume there like no ways.

378
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.380
So that's what I did,

379
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.720
right?

380
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.140
Split lines is going to split your output window A list.

381
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.740
It's very,

382
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.450
very important.

383
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.810
Fine.

384
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.840
So this is the procedure to run.

385
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.710
You were commands using Shelley closed toe ruin yourself process.

386
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:53.000
And you have to understand one more thing here when our if you're actually cause a true

387
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.510
internal,

388
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.410
your python is going toe weapon.

389
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.310
You were UNIX like systems shell on.

390
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.030
There it is.

391
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.250
Running your commands.

392
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.250
Right?

393
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.210
See,

394
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.580
Let me come into his gold first.

395
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:14.370
Know what I'm doing is I'm going to run.

396
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:19.540
I'm going to run your command as instead of string.

397
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.650
I'm going to run your common as a list.

398
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:26.770
Nothing is there how to get you were command as a list of 40 work.

399
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.840
Let's say somebody I have taken commercially cost in this way.

400
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.450
When I'm very financially cause you to write,

401
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.860
just take it on.

402
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.840
Do split operation.

403
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.150
That's it.

404
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.520
Then what is the reason you're getting you're getting as a list.

405
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.380
That's what you can do.

406
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.980
I mean,

407
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.080
whenever he potentially cause to false what you're always just take your normal common off

408
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.980
your operating system as a strength,

409
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.460
they're not play split operation.

410
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.650
That's it as much as simple.

411
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.570
Right?

412
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.130
Fine.

413
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:59.010
Know what I'm doing is C command equals two.

414
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.350
First fight your normal come and whatever you have,

415
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.150
I'm just a place please.

416
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.340
Right.

417
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.050
But I know if I spit this result how you're going to get your commanders were directly.

418
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:16.350
I'm writing as a list unless hyphen l rt night.

419
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.260
No,

420
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.860
nothing is there.

421
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.770
Everything is saying everything is said.

422
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.110
Let me copy and paste.

423
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:27.830
Er the only thing is Shelly cause to fall so hard to mention Now you're fighting is not

424
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.910
going to open one more shell directly with your python.

425
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.630
You are going to run your command.

426
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.090
So they're here.

427
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.370
There is some smaller Monday's.

428
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.230
Instead of opening new shell on yourself,

429
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.680
running your commands unusual and getting back your result from day to your python,

430
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.220
right,

431
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.650
you're not using now in new shell concept,

432
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.020
you're going to run your command.

433
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.160
Using your pipe on itself that is a meaningful writing shall equals two falls.

434
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.160
Thank you,

435
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.630
but let me run this Cordant.

436
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.050
Show you the output first.

437
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.550
Yes,

438
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.650
you're getting same or put right?

439
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.560
There is no change exactly.

440
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.390
Or getting around Port.

441
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.710
Thank fine.

442
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.790
Then when you are today,

443
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.170
actually,

444
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:10.830
cause approved on when you heard it actually goes to false see inches off this command.

445
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.900
I'm going to take one more common call.

446
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.050
Command equals two.

447
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.020
Actually,

448
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.450
I want to run a command call.

449
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.100
See?

450
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.850
There my command is this one.

451
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.840
A court dollar home is my calmer right.

452
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.280
But I want to split that.

453
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:26.850
Yes,

454
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.910
I'm doing split,

455
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.520
but I know how the output would be if I spread that common.

456
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.050
That's what exactly I'm reading as a list.

457
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.350
So initially,

458
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.540
if you don't get I mean,

459
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.660
if you have any confusion,

460
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.220
just take your cameras.

461
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.200
A string on our play.

462
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.630
A split operation on expert.

463
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.260
They were output as a list.

464
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.260
Not yet.

465
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.620
No,

466
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.970
if I run this command,

467
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.630
But what is output you're going to get first of all,

468
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.450
first of all,

469
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.620
on my UNIX like systems.

470
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.060
I know.

471
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.910
What is the output off your Echo Dollar homecoming?

472
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.600
I'm getting some home used to use up right,

473
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.050
but I don't know what I'm running.

474
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.320
I'm running my command.

475
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.010
Same comment.

476
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.580
But in terms off as a list,

477
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:09.950
I mean,

478
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:10.230
Shelley,

479
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.050
cause to falls.

480
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:11.970
No,

481
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.990
If I run you out,

482
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.410
I mean,

483
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.740
you are command using your pytorch.

484
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.020
See the result.

485
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.760
What you're getting,

486
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.410
You're not getting home,

487
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.950
you see to use or you're getting simply dollar home itself.

488
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.260
What is the problem?

489
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.840
Actually,

490
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.070
you are expecting or put something like this.

491
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.720
This one,

492
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.610
this is output.

493
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.020
Actually,

494
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.660
we need to get using this common.

495
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.380
But if I run,

496
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.080
you're not getting that right.

497
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.850
Just a bait.

498
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.050
You will get clarity.

499
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.170
Same Come.

500
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.690
And now I'm going to run.

501
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.740
Using you are silicone.

502
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.840
True process.

503
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.350
And if anybody for actually caused through what you need to do,

504
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:57.880
you had to write your command as a string only Let me take my new commoners so already.

505
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.760
How year?

506
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.420
Let me copy investor.

507
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:06.480
So whenever if you're writing Shelley course through your command is as it is.

508
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480
Whatever the command,

509
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.590
you're going to run only what?

510
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.160
Operating some same command yard to right When nobody if you take sell,

511
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.850
it cost Prue.

512
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.720
No.

513
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.370
See the result?

514
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.160
If I take Shelly Coastal through what is all pretty are getting.

515
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.680
You know,

516
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.660
you're expecting your result as of these,

517
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.130
So nothing is there,

518
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.550
guys,

519
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:28.520
in case if your commander depends on environment variables off your operating system,

520
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.580
then only ordered actually caused true otherwise no need to take Shelly Coastal drew on

521
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.820
your index like systems.

522
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.000
Let's say you and we comer some very how you are home variable.

523
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.870
That is anyone with Very But let me show you.

524
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.460
That hurt me.

525
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:50.160
Such a Yeah.

526
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.510
See,

527
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.950
this is the environment available for my operating system.

528
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:58.400
So whenever if you want to get environment variable values are there.

529
00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.490
No.

530
00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:04.410
But if you're going to work on anyone meant variables using your python any 100 variables

531
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.240
off your operating system using your fight on,

532
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.390
then you 100 actually coasted through injury.

533
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.600
Next,

534
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.930
like systems otherwise known intraday actually cost true.

535
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.790
You can take Singlish l'equippe stow falls.

536
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.990
So if we take Shelly Coastal falls,

537
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:21.490
there is advantage that at one disease you're going to sell sometimes because whenever if

538
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.270
you take Shelly Coaster Prue,

539
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:28.070
your python is going to open in new terminal on their your partner is going to run your

540
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.950
core on getting back the result from that shell,

541
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.490
it is taking some extra time compared to Shelly,

542
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.260
cause to falls.

543
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.210
If you take Shelly closed toe falls,

544
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.530
your pattern is not opening a new terminal.

545
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.800
Simply designing with your pipe on itself.

546
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.250
That's where you will sail sometime.

547
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.450
That is our bondage.

548
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.190
But but nobody if you need where nobody.

549
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.590
If you have a work with you,

550
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.280
are anyone minto variables off your operating system?

551
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.240
Then there is no other option.

552
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.740
Your Arabic Shelley cost Prue only right.

553
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.110
So guys know you know the difference between Shelley cause of true and false.

554
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.280
Right?

555
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.980
So if I take silicosis through your command should be a string.

556
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.430
If I take Shelly close to false,

557
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.760
your command should be a list.

558
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.590
So let me right in.

559
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.080
Everyone's were.

560
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.460
Now,

561
00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.050
if Shelly Coastal Brew,

562
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:16.430
right?

563
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.660
If Calico's Drew,

564
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.310
then you are common.

565
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.850
He's it's string are simply as you were,

566
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.260
ways comment.

567
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.860
So simply copy and paste your ways Command in terms off.

568
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.260
I mean,

569
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.350
inside of quotations.

570
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.260
If she Alecos to falls,

571
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.900
then you were command.

572
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.010
He's a list like so.

573
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:41.450
No,

574
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.000
no,

575
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.690
Shelly.

576
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.680
Close to falls.

577
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:52.690
Don't work on your ways environment.

578
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.250
Great idea,

579
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.650
But this right?

580
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.230
That means if you have a walk with your environment variables off your operating system,

581
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:07.650
you have to actually cause to prove only that's it Example I'm making Suppose if your

582
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:13.320
command is Lennox common already knows common If it is a less siphon LRT this if your

583
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.600
command is suppose l a siphon LRT I'm writing as a string by simply mention inside of

584
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.350
quotations.

585
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.170
So here we are today,

586
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.510
actually,

587
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.550
cause approved someone's If you want to take Shelly close to falls,

588
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:34.830
sell it goes to falls then see how I'm going to create my command.

589
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:40.520
Nothing is that you're previous come and whatever you how Just write it Whatever the window

590
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.660
saw the next come and you have just tried it then do simply split Operation Internal.

591
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.060
It'll convert that as a list.

592
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:46.940
You know it right?

593
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:53.540
Like if you won't write C once If you get a practice directly connected,

594
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.720
how your command would be as a list.

595
00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:03.170
Simply take your common Shelley cause true comer and then use a split operation that you're

596
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.250
going to get as a list.

597
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.160
If it is the least yard actually goes to false and also process.

598
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.640
That's a as much as him,

599
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.760
but right.

600
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.950
Fine.

601
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.670
Know what I'm doing is yeah.

602
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.440
You are on UNIX like systems,

603
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:18.700
right?

604
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.550
That's fine on your UNIX like systems.

605
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.770
But in windows,

606
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.450
Cameron's guys in millions command solar Always Your heart today shall equals approve only

607
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.300
if you take Jellicles to false your windows wound.

608
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.510
Exclude your command first.

609
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.850
Awful.

610
00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.320
Right.

611
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.780
So just one more note.

612
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.290
Based on my practice,

613
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.560
my real time experience.

614
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.890
I'm saying that if you have any challenge with your windows operating system,

615
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.070
just research some work on Shelly closed toe.

616
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.450
Why Shellie cell is ah not equals two falls in your windows.

617
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:57.210
But based on my experience eyes I saw so many situations before it.

618
00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.230
A shallow coastal falls.

619
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.350
It is not going to work.

620
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.510
So shall equals.

621
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.450
Always true.

622
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.230
Yes,

623
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.760
take.

624
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.710
I mean,

625
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.050
it is not mandatory,

626
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.390
but if it actually goes to falls,

627
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.930
your most of the Windows command won't work.

628
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.310
That's why based on my practice,

629
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:20.770
I'm saying that shall equals toe Always true on windows.

630
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.940
That's it then.

631
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.050
No doubt on that windows simply Your command is always a string,

632
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.530
right?

633
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.580
Let me show you that.

634
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.970
Let me show you that import lately.

635
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.200
I'm showing on your command line.

636
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.780
No,

637
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.230
you condone any comment on your windows?

638
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.660
Also,

639
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.850
CSP close to their laminating sub process.

640
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.350
Not the weapon process weapon.

641
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.490
Then come.

642
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.750
And let's say I'm taking as a list the air commerce.

643
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.130
So as a testament,

644
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.440
you know,

645
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.720
Shelly,

646
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.550
coastal falls,

647
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.050
But the financial cost of false who knows who is not accepting that?

648
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.260
Let me write STD.

649
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:07.490
All because to so process not pipe unnecessarily every coastal,

650
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.710
so process,

651
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.450
not bike.

652
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.660
See there.

653
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.900
But if it actually goes toe to now,

654
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.350
it will let it will exclude properly.

655
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.690
Let me right now.

656
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.090
String.

657
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.680
I'm in common as a string Nazi there.

658
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.490
That is not better.

659
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.700
I'm just wait for it in court.

660
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.690
Artie Catesby,

661
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:36.120
not rate and see the results rt value such as now you can find out.

662
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.550
All put on Eric goes to simply sp Lord communicate.

663
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:46.180
Now let me print your out right.

664
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:53.280
You're getting some more pork and see the type off your oak output.

665
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.660
It is a bite,

666
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.210
but I need to get as a string that I wanted her to do.

667
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:03.350
You have right always universal new lines Seacoast approved.

668
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:10.260
So these option just to get your data in dumps off a string.

669
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.850
Now let me convert You are output SP value.

670
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.650
I mean separated or put another.

671
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.480
Let me print.

672
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.550
You are out using split lines.

673
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.330
You know what is already are expecting as a list?

674
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:27.700
Yes,

675
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.150
it's working.

676
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:28.850
No Perfectly.

677
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.790
Okay.

678
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.240
So,

679
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:31.630
guys,

680
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.130
based on my experience,

681
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.030
I am saying that Shelley Costa drew always the only Windows opening system and common is

682
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.760
always the string.

683
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.590
Maybe I'm not sure for which command You're going to get output if even if you actually

684
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.450
cause to falls.

685
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:50.020
But most of the cases I usually Costa true for all my commands then only I got my That's

686
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.160
why I'm giving Chile Costa true.

687
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.260
Okay,

688
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.710
okay.

689
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.760
So you can find this document are as a resource for this video.

690
00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.850
Okay.

691
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.780
Okay.

692
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.770
Thank you for watching this.

693
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.350
Realize
