1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
friends here.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,110
We're going to discuss a boat,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,750
if else conditional statement.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,280
So before going toe,

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,300
enter with your defense condition statement already We know Simple if condition.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,550
Right?

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,050
So using that I want to write a small script.

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,900
Right?

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,370
Let me weapon my editor.

10
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,520
So here,

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,430
I'm going to use sublime text reader You can use any attack,

12
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,510
right?

13
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,920
Fine.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
Let me go.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,130
Some name for my Python script.

16
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,820
The name is convert indoor title format.

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,290
So get a title for matter Get a title for Mart,

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,060
not be white.

19
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:47,130
So my intention is I want to read some string that string I want to convert into title

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:55,840
Former but first let me right there User string I'm taking variable cord user string So I

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,960
want to read a string.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,350
So if you want to read a string you had to take always input under you were string Nothing

23
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:04,350
.

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,460
Then after that,

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,950
simply What I'm doing is I'm printing your user string dot title format You know,

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,930
if you want to convert any string into title for my there is a string operation called

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,900
Title Right,

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,990
Let me weapon my come on line.

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,140
Right.

30
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,940
So we have our scripts on desktop bite on scripting.

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,650
So here our striptease get title for might not be way See that step?

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,650
We have only two lines off script,

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,580
right?

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,010
If you run,

35
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,830
your scapegoat will learn from taco down The very first Laney's user equals to import.

36
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,100
So because off this he was keeping will ask something like Enderle was string.

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,320
Let me run this Yes,

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,510
it is asking I'm goingto provide by tone scripting So now you have press the enter on your

39
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,680
keyboard What will happen?

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,470
Whatever the data you are providing here that data will go on store in tow This variable on

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,940
the next step What we're doing So this line is warmer If you press enter,

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,850
this line is over.

43
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,910
There are for they're simply or fighting is going to bring to your given string I'm in user

44
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,830
string That string is converting the title former than it is printing Sit output Yes,

45
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,900
You're getting bite on scripting Capital P and capitalists.

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:34,580
This is fine But before converting into title format the skipper has to ask like do you

47
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,220
want to convert this script into title format or not?

48
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,190
If I say yes then only it has to convert.

49
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,160
If I say no,

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
it don't convert.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,730
But it has to print that.

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,050
Given sting as it is,

53
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:54,650
See that what I'm doing then I am taking user confirmation as a variable user confirmation

54
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:54,650
,

55
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,770
and I want to read yes or no?

56
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes,

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,880
always a spring.

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,350
That's why I get I'm taking input.

59
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,430
Do you want to look inward?

60
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:13,650
You are given string Indo title for my say yes or no.

61
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:21,150
Not right?

62
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,390
No.

63
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,580
If you that says yes,

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,990
then only I want to convert the data into tightly for murder.

65
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,870
And then I want to display so two lines.

66
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,160
First,

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,050
Lenny's reading a string second lines getting confirmation from the user.

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,390
Right?

69
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,520
So what are the user is going to enter?

70
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,040
I mean,

71
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,150
either yes or no that we are storing into this variable?

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,960
No,

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,700
I am taking with if condition.

74
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,450
If user confirmation is it caused serious,

75
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,720
then only I want to exclude this line.

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,250
That is Miss Lane.

77
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,400
If users says yes,

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,410
then this value becomes true.

79
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,710
No,

80
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,980
because you will.

81
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,400
You threes entering Yes,

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,700
On that value were storing into user confirmation.

83
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,210
Variable.

84
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,750
Now we're taking user confirmation under this Director string.

85
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,590
Are they equal if you're under.

86
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:13,930
Yes,

87
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,460
then yes.

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,900
Definitely.

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,650
This is equal.

90
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,270
If it is equal than this,

91
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,100
youth is allowing to exclude this line by your piper.

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,550
Not a like for us to see the output.

93
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,270
So let me clear my screen.

94
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,450
Let me weapon You are script Now I'm going to run,

95
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,620
so I know.

96
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,370
But if you run,

97
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,730
you know it is going to explode from top down.

98
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,510
Very fast.

99
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,850
Lane.

100
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,030
See the output First land excluding.

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,000
Enter your string.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,740
I'm wondering.

103
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,150
Bite on scripting.

104
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,200
Then it is asking because off second line Do you want to come?

105
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,810
What you're given?

106
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,050
String into title Former say yes or no.

107
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,920
Let me type.

108
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,470
Yes.

109
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,750
And I'm pressing Enter so that nobody.

110
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,090
If you hit the enter on your keyboard,

111
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,850
what will happen?

112
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,800
This s value will go on store into this.

113
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,550
That's over.

114
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,030
Then two lines are over.

115
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,460
Then you're quite animatedly Goto,

116
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,980
Carline.

117
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,500
There he is,

118
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,050
The star light.

119
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,080
So now you are entering yous.

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,340
This year's on this year's both are equal.

121
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,550
That's what we're checking here.

122
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,280
If they are really equal than this value becomes true.

123
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,260
If it is true,

124
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,940
then this youth if will a lot.

125
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,210
We exclude this line,

126
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,240
that's why.

127
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,970
Sit output.

128
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,450
You're getting into writing for months.

129
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,050
I mean capital PN capitalists.

130
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,670
No,

131
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,510
let me read on.

132
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,150
And I'm providing simply by conscripting once again.

133
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,650
But I'm saying no,

134
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,000
no,

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,050
you're not getting in output.

136
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,970
See why nobody if we under no you know No.

137
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,070
He is going to store in tow.

138
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,730
This variable now in your hand this variable is like no no equals.

139
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,030
Yes,

140
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,600
No false?

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,850
No,

142
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,210
no,

143
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,850
because yes,

144
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,990
faults.

145
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,470
If it is false,

146
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,040
then if condition doesn't a lot,

147
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,020
we exclude this line.

148
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,450
That's why you're not getting any input.

149
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,250
But might equipment bees,

150
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:04,950
Even though if you enter know at least I hope to get normal string display.

151
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,090
I mean,

152
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,620
the string,

153
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,630
whatever you are giving,

154
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,860
Same thing I want to get.

155
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,730
If I say no,

156
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,660
If I say yes,

157
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,360
I want to get in the title for my right.

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,820
So that's why what I'm doing is I'm going to add one more of condition.

159
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,490
User confirmation.

160
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,070
If it is equals to know,

161
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,160
that means user is not willing to convert their given string in tow.

162
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Title for murder.

163
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,990
The not the time simply directly print.

164
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,330
We were given string as it is not to right,

165
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,160
No seed output type Get for my friendly format.

166
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,400
Let me run this script on.

167
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,260
See that result?

168
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:54,480
I am giving suppose welcome to fight on scripting and I want to convert this as a title for

169
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,700
murder.

170
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,880
That's why I'm saying to my school please convert it.

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,850
I'm wondering Yes.

172
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,910
Then you are getting ready for my then Breeland,

173
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,530
right?

174
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,670
I'm wondering Welcome to pipe landscaping But now I'm saying no If I said no what will

175
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:14,900
happen you're getting as it is your string then how your script is working first up very

176
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,350
here.

177
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,510
But nobody if you say yes.

178
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,430
This is true that for your excluding this line at the same time whenever you are saying you

179
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,250
are entering Yes.

180
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,610
Then this is false.

181
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:25,800
No.

182
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,140
Yes,

183
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,430
your companion with no falls.

184
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,280
That's why this if condition is excluding this line.

185
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,570
But no.

186
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,510
But if you say yes on this if condition is not excluding you were lined whenever.

187
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,410
If you say yes,

188
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:45,530
That means if you say yes this condition is true and this condition is false that way This

189
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,320
if condition is excluding this line on this if condition is not excluding this line,

190
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,750
that's fine.

191
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,060
Like Okay,

192
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,380
no.

193
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,670
Let in the second case you are wondering No,

194
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:58,950
right.

195
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,730
I know.

196
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,020
But if we say no,

197
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,850
No,

198
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,740
this if condition becoming false.

199
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,100
That's why this is not executing this if condition becoming proved.

200
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,770
That's why you're excluding this line.

201
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,790
I mean your bite any excluding this line.

202
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,850
That's where you're getting this one,

203
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,950
right?

204
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,800
Yeah.

205
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,580
This is okay.

206
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,100
Your script is working perfectly as for your requirement,

207
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,250
but the thing is,

208
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,440
that is,

209
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,850
if you say yes if you say yes.

210
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,750
I assume that if it's a is this condition will differently becomes true.

211
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,850
Then you are printing this line at the time.

212
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,830
You need to take this condition by already.

213
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,800
You're saying yes.

214
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,350
Then why you are checking for no right.

215
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,600
If this is true,

216
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,050
you don't need to check this condition.

217
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,520
If this is false,

218
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,850
then just check this condition night.

219
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,410
So,

220
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:50,830
guys,

221
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,020
whenever if you have only two options,

222
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,050
like yes or no,

223
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:04,400
like yes or no whenever If you have only two options like yes or no at the time you need to

224
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,790
write or to see operative conditions simply you can write else here,

225
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,650
then how it is going to work.

226
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,750
Nothing is their guests very simple after that?

227
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,650
In case if this condition is true,

228
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,640
if this condition is true,

229
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,560
you're fighting.

230
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,410
Let's could this line.

231
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:24,930
I mean,

232
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,660
if he's a lying to exclude this line and if this condition is true by default,

233
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,760
your python is going to skip this part.

234
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,300
Brighton won't check this one.

235
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,070
But in case if this condition is false,

236
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,050
this result is false.

237
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,110
You know,

238
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,750
if it is not going to exclude this line,

239
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,990
it is not allowing to exclude this line.

240
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,430
And if disease falls,

241
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,750
if this is false,

242
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,450
big clear.

243
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:59,960
If this is false by default with told taking any condition your python well executed the

244
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,660
else block in else.

245
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,090
Whatever.

246
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,050
You have a cord that court will exclude without taking any condition.

247
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,650
Right?

248
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:16,310
So remember that when you have to take if ehlz whenever If we have only two possible values

249
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,450
for your requirement,

250
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,000
then only auto take you for nails.

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,220
See,

252
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,060
for user conformation as off.

253
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,260
No,

254
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,850
we are treating only yes or no.

255
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,160
If it is Yes.

256
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,590
This line has to exclude if this is no by default.

257
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,850
We had to exclude this line.

258
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,790
So if you take you fells one second I'm repeating.

259
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,040
If you take you fills condition If whatever you're writing here,

260
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,350
if that is true pure bipedal legs Could this lane on your part on Don't concert this part?

261
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,500
If this is excluding your Buyten's simply by default,

262
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,850
it will skip this part.

263
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,780
You know not to bother award that in case if this condition is false,

264
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,260
then only or fight on will exclude this line or the block which is there under your l's

265
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,550
without taking any condition.

266
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,090
Night Let me take one more example so that it will be clear for you.

267
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,510
No,

268
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,650
I'm going to come in this Otherwise I would write new script,

269
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:29,860
find greater number not be Wait See,

270
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,030
my intention is I want to read to numbers and then I want to comfort So whatever the number

271
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,900
is higher that number I want to display.

272
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,550
See that?

273
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:45,650
So really one numbers you can take a malfunction then input Enter your number So there is a

274
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,450
three d string Don't take a malfunction,

275
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,690
right?

276
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,170
Not enough taking a well functioning for dessert string If it is any value other than the

277
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,510
string.

278
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,320
Then you have to use a well functioning fight on three and very well.

279
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,850
First number.

280
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,530
Then I'm going toe.

281
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,360
Take one more number from user.

282
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,370
Second number.

283
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,350
Let's say B input and you were second number.

284
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,250
That's fine.

285
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,750
No,

286
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,040
sit directly.

287
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:27,650
I can't display like yea is greater than B.

288
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,140
I can't buy directly in this right because we thought,

289
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,040
knowing the relationship between your year and be How can I say Yeah,

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,890
he's gonna then be are,

291
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,780
Let's say one more line B is greater than you.

292
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:49,760
I can't say right retort Knowing relationship between without knowing her year and B values

293
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:49,760
.

294
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,250
I can't decide which statement I need to display.

295
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,670
But if you remember,

296
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,840
if you remember,

297
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,890
you have a comparison.

298
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,690
Operators,

299
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,250
right,

300
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,350
Let me enter into my python.

301
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,650
Let's say three less done.

302
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,100
Do so.

303
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,420
Therefore,

304
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,260
less Any number.

305
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,430
Any number four less done to It's a false no no.

306
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:17,540
I can decay close to four and be close to to know I'm combating yea less than be if really

307
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,490
a value less than B,

308
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,330
then you'll get a true.

309
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,840
Otherwise you'll get a false then this poor,

310
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,890
false reserved I can use any condition right.

311
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,150
But what if you're getting results as true or false?

312
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,500
Always.

313
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,250
I can use that in my youth condition.

314
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,950
That's why what I'm doing is here is if I want to print this information.

315
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,250
But if I want to print this information you ever you must be greater than be.

316
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,430
That's why I can right here.

317
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,640
If you is greater than be if really is greater than be,

318
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,950
this valley will become true.

319
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,920
So you think is true.

320
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,800
Be clear Race If the result off younger than be east True then only I want to display this

321
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,080
line right?

322
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:07,110
If you ever lose rather than be then only I want to split this line the same way Suppose if

323
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,350
b value is greater than year then I wanted to split this life.

324
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,060
Right?

325
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:21,850
So what I'm doing is if if really eager than B then definitely get approved.

326
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,010
If it is true,

327
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,220
then you're going to exclude this line.

328
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,250
I went to work no the same day.

329
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,750
If the value is greater than you then I can print this line.

330
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,630
No,

331
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,090
it will work.

332
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,350
No,

333
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,900
but see that resulted.

334
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:49,460
Your street name is fine.

335
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,220
Gator number,

336
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,550
right?

337
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:56,250
So I'm going to run this So I'm giving them Was like fight and nine.

338
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,280
Yes,

339
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,630
my knees.

340
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,220
Good of them.

341
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,560
Woman I'm making writing both RB Well is here.

342
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,150
Yeah.

343
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,970
Here I immigrated Variable Here.

344
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,850
I'll see that.

345
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,470
I'm wondering First number as support.

346
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,150
Some fight on second number as mine you're getting mine is good of gunfire.

347
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,010
Ah,

348
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,870
let me Day three are then one freeze rather than one.

349
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,850
It's working perfectly,

350
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,750
right?

351
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,150
No.

352
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,500
Instead of writing younger than be on bigger than you suppose just a gym.

353
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,750
It's not perfect.

354
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,420
If he is greater than be I wanted to split this information.

355
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,450
If it is false,

356
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,450
then I'm going to split this information.

357
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,450
It is correct up to a certain point,

358
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,750
that is just after that I'm wondering in this way four and fight.

359
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,320
What happened?

360
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,020
Yeah.

361
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,550
Sorry.

362
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,950
It's my back.

363
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,890
I'm wondering number five and then I'm minding some number Number seven Someone is greater

364
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,360
than five.

365
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,950
It's working.

366
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:10,090
Then I went thing seven and some do well shut seven and then to Yes,

367
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,470
Sony's good of them boots working.

368
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,180
But if I dio both are same numbers.

369
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,340
Fight and fight.

370
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,940
You're getting five girls and four that is not.

371
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,250
It'll correct right now.

372
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:29,460
See here when you're taking fondles when you are taking for nails.

373
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,540
If there are only two possibilities for your results,

374
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,150
I mean 40 were value.

375
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,740
See if I take you over loose,

376
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,430
let's say 213 I gender.

377
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,160
This may be greater than off.

378
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,960
This are maybe less than off this or maybe equals off that right.

379
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,000
If you take to where it was like year and be based on the N B values,

380
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,970
they may be equal.

381
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,590
Ari is greater than B or B is greater than you.

382
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,920
Three possibilities are there Whenever.

383
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,140
If your three possible days you can't take simply even else block you can take simply.

384
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,520
If one else block,

385
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,260
then how you can write your court right?

386
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,450
See that now how I'm going to manipulate this thing?

387
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,310
See,

388
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,700
you can,

389
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,310
I'd like in this else.

390
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,720
If you feel you have a little less than be,

391
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:31,160
then I can write B is greater than you or I can also write the A's less than be yes,

392
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,840
less than be on and see,

393
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,920
maybe a equals to be right.

394
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,500
There is a chance to how equal So I that that time I can write.

395
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,790
Sorry.

396
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,110
Yeah.

397
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,770
And yeah.

398
00:17:51,770 --> 00:18:00,450
And the B our same are equal not to no guys I'm doing here.

399
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,730
You may be greater than be Are you may be less than Lee.

400
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,130
Yeah,

401
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,780
also,

402
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,700
maybe there is a chance to how you and b values are equal.

403
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,630
That's why whenever he film multiple possibilities well,

404
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,320
comparing your values,

405
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,180
then you can extend your if condition in this way.

406
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,470
If Elsie form or condition Elsie form or condition,

407
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,380
you can also write it.

408
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,450
How multiple puzzle,

409
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:22,760
Paul.

410
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,590
Possible days.

411
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,660
You can also write one more else if Right,

412
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,450
fine.

413
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,670
Let me on this.

414
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,720
See,

415
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,260
I'm and bring foreign four.

416
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,410
What happened?

417
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,620
What is less than for maybe you and be Yeah,

418
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,340
I have given you.

419
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,760
And it's my bag on second.

420
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,820
Okay.

421
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,420
See here.

422
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,450
Amending number four and four.

423
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,260
Four and four are equal four and seven.

424
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,840
Or let me take some first iron number.

425
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,430
Second lower number.

426
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,850
It's working perfectly.

427
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,450
Right?

428
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,760
Plane?

429
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,050
No.

430
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,760
See here,

431
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,850
Grace Foster thing.

432
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,700
You are having a simple of condition.

433
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,860
Second thing whenever.

434
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,490
If you home to a loose for you were required thing then at that time you can take you for

435
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,050
nails.

436
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,310
But here,

437
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,590
whenever.

438
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,170
If you're comparing two values,

439
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,470
right,

440
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,810
you help.

441
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,850
Three possibilities.

442
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,590
First number greater than second number or first number less than second number.

443
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,610
Our first number one second number What are equal.

444
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,260
So at the time you can use,

445
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,210
if else if else if condition like.

446
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,270
And one more thing here.

447
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,100
Three possibilities.

448
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,400
Right.

449
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,100
So by this block by this block by these two conditions,

450
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,400
you're checking greater than and less than so if these two conditions all false agenda.

451
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,900
If these two conditions are false,

452
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,870
then biting for the end of your equal,

453
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,210
Right?

454
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,250
So at that time,

455
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,080
what you can do is simply goodnight else.

456
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,500
Block.

457
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,960
No need to check your condition.

458
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,260
Whether the acres to be or not.

459
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,950
Why I am writing else.

460
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,340
If it is right in this way,

461
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,260
you talking No problem.

462
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,450
It's okay.

463
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,780
It will work perfectly without any confusion.

464
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,910
It will work perfectly.

465
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,960
But what I am saying,

466
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,250
he's assume that I'm giving a value tree on be value for gig.

467
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,010
Sorry.

468
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,670
Yeah.

469
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,770
First I load this thing.

470
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,640
Yeah,

471
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,240
greater than be revelatory and be really for this is here.

472
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,020
And this is big younger than be no false.

473
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,220
If this is false,

474
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,550
your python will skip this line.

475
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,950
Because if dozen dollop breaks got this line then immediately or biting will come toe

476
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,090
Second condition Guild will check a less than be yes,

477
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:50,270
True if it is to your pattern will exclude this line on remaining all remaining conditions

478
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,270
.

479
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,760
Your fight on by default,

480
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,090
it will skip you.

481
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,640
Don't take the first condition.

482
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,910
If it is true remaining,

483
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,630
all conditions are going to skip Whether they may be too are not You don't bother award

484
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,080
that year by Tony's going to skip that right?

485
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,260
But in our case,

486
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,910
suppose as off my If I take 300 both are equal.

487
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,160
No.

488
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,330
So this condition definitely false because you're taking three greater than three No,

489
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,340
false because they're both are equal.

490
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,570
So this is false.

491
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,350
This is false.

492
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,630
So whenever we fear to lose and greater than and less than conditions are false,

493
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,990
then remaining option is equals.

494
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,720
Two equals only,

495
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,050
right?

496
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,090
That's why what I'm saying is you need to check this for directly.

497
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,260
I can bite else here.

498
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,050
So else means,

499
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,410
you know,

500
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,950
before the block,

501
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:44,570
when all of all conditions are false then only else will excuse when all about conditions

502
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,180
are false,

503
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,550
then only else will execute.

504
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,910
So if you take any two values which are equal for your first and second variable year and

505
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,260
be then this is false this is false.

506
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,880
That's why you're if he's going to execute else blocked by default in case of any one of

507
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,660
the condition is true,

508
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,660
that condition will execute other ways.

509
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,740
If all conditions are false,

510
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,450
then only else will X cure.

511
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,300
Right?

512
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,660
Fine.

513
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,400
So,

514
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,620
guys,

515
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:19,050
this is all about simply your If else on if else if else if condition Okay.

516
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,320
So in next video,

517
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,200
we will write one simple skip to understand effectively.

518
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,760
You are if else if else if conditions Okay.

519
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,680
Okay.

520
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,260
Thank you for watching this review.
