1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
prince here.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,200
Our concept Please compile operation or matter off or remodel.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,830
See,

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,550
we know that we have different types off operations in your body model.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,640
Let me go with some off them s so that I can explain the uses off campaign operation.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,450
Suppose our house some string here.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,750
No,

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,340
I need to write a pattern.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,080
Such there.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,150
I want boo.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,150
Fine.

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,150
Uh,

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,400
by Tony.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,850
Is there any given string or not?

15
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,880
Then just let me write apartment.

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,450
Suppose first I will go and work with the final operation.

17
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,610
Ah,

18
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,550
how many Beytin or there?

19
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,300
In a given string?

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,650
So for that I am writing is simply a partner So that first time writing simply fight on.

21
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,780
But I want to look for a word.

22
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,650
Then you had to,

23
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,420
right?

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,250
With slash B starting on ending than exactly word matching.

25
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,720
Now first,

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,970
let me simply print or your daughter find all from your pattern in a given string.

27
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,450
How many?

28
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,830
Matching czar there See,

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,350
that is a We're getting only one bite on.

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,980
But how here Python on here also fight on anywhere These are bite onto on by country No

31
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,350
blow.

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,570
So here capital P in your small p.

33
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,860
Then you can write in two ways to identify this.

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,750
Small people Eitan Cattle be bite under days If you write in square brackets,

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,770
very first character,

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,590
it may be small,

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,850
pure capital p no see.

38
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,450
The results are injured after inch of that.

39
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,650
Suppose if you don't want to.

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,320
Custer a boat case sensitivity.

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,850
Simply connect a flat here.

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,160
If you remember,

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,660
there is option called flags.

44
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,870
Simply right or not,

45
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,710
I now see the result.

46
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,040
You're going to get fight on small and capital now.

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,910
Along with that,

48
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,980
I need to identify,

49
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,320
Bite onto or python three.

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,800
Also,

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,100
then Ardian two or three is optional.

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,430
Right then there is a question work.

53
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,670
So the question mark meaning is either two or three,

54
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,660
maybe once or none.

55
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,060
That is the meaning off your question.

56
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,830
More see,

57
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,560
we already discussed aboard the rules to create your patterns in our previous videos,

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:11,850
right?

59
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,540
So based on that,

60
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,690
I'm creating this pattern.

61
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,410
That's fine.

62
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,420
Now let me run decency.

63
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,880
The result.

64
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,040
Now you're going to get fight on Capitol.

65
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,170
People turn by turn toe turnpike country.

66
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,640
That is the uses off patrons.

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,110
Actually,

68
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,970
I'm in brackets,

69
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,250
regular expressions.

70
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,580
That's fine.

71
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,180
No suppose I'm using different operations on my same pattern.

72
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,700
Suppose I'm using already darts.

73
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,170
Such your partner,

74
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,710
then in a given string.

75
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,900
So what is your given string?

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,500
This one?

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,920
No.

78
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,630
See the result?

79
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,140
You're getting some object?

80
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,400
Yes,

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,250
there is a match.

82
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,390
So if there is a match,

83
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,850
then you can look for the were required.

84
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,980
Ah,

85
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,440
I mean,

86
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,360
what is the match?

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,790
And very start matching creation According to give instinct.

88
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,670
You can go with that.

89
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,130
Like start in the group.

90
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,570
Right?

91
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,450
We have those operations.

92
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,550
That's fine.

93
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,730
No,

94
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,580
let me do one more operation.

95
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,080
So I want to print.

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,480
I want to split to my given string based on my pattern.

97
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,050
So what is my pattern?

98
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,160
So normally annuals things.

99
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,240
You have a spirit operation.

100
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
If you go with that,

101
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,890
it can able to split the or given sting based on one single string.

102
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,030
But here I'm going to divide my given string based on either python or capital beep Eitan

103
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,640
or python to our fight country.

104
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,990
Simply wherever these four words are there in a given string,

105
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,550
their split will happen.

106
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,000
So that is a uses off split from your regular expression.

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now let me write your string and see that is a yes so like ways you can use There were

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,090
different operations,

109
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,010
right?

110
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:56,900
But here suppose sometimes you're going to use same patron multiple times in your given

111
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,350
core.

112
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,020
I mean,

113
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,600
what are the core?

114
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,190
Your writing in your core?

115
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,140
You're going to use your pattern.

116
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,050
But the pattern you how that pattern you are going to use multiple times.

117
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,910
So whenever,

118
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:13,430
if we're using multiple times in giraffe using in this way we are going with compile

119
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,080
operation first either court politic and understand that I would like you once again.

120
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,450
No,

121
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,450
I'm creating.

122
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,320
I had an object battle object nothing.

123
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,770
Is there simply already dot com pile Whatever the pattern,

124
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,150
you how touch it.

125
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,720
Now,

126
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,190
if you print your pattern opposite,

127
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,590
foresee the reason what happened?

128
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:47,450
Study Spelling mistake.

129
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:55,250
You'll see that you are getting a pattern that in terms off object.

130
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,850
Now this is a object not like simply your fight on something like that.

131
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,120
Your python is converting.

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,550
Now your pattern do an object?

133
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,580
No,

134
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,740
on this object.

135
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,240
Instead of performing your operations in this way,

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,340
our radar start started out.

137
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,600
Final orders split or whatever the operation.

138
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,550
You how in self there directly.

139
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,350
You can perform your operation on this object.

140
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,830
See that my sorry pattern lobs it.

141
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:35,210
Bring supposed patron object dot your operation then only string because already pattern is

142
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:44,100
that in this object only string You want string now see the result Whatever the output

143
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:52,520
Previously you guard same or pretty or getting here Let me enable your previous all put we

144
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,850
thought to compile operation whatever the way we're using to use such is there any

145
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,870
difference between these two?

146
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,170
First are putting last or put there is no difference.

147
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:12,390
But while comparing first procedure I'm in 60 lane syntax You were 13 times having more

148
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,210
efficiency.

149
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:21,560
So speed off operation is very high for you Simply pattern objects not only for that you

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,690
can use all operations Now let me this a believer Normal direct operations Now I'm using

151
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,550
you can use for each and every operation You can use this pattern object Brighton object

152
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,950
not find all Then simply you will string What is the string?

153
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,350
The only pattern is there in this object gaze.

154
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,500
So now this partner object is supporting to perform your all regular expressions without

155
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,830
any ari model See that previously to perform your operations,

156
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,890
you're using already dark.

157
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,710
But now we're using pattern up there dot So already inside of this pattern upset you're

158
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,730
already is there on your compile pattern is also there undoubtedly were doing or oppression

159
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,130
on that.

160
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,930
So that is a Brighton object.

161
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,250
Find all python.

162
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,230
What happened?

163
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,730
Where is it?

164
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,350
Yeah,

165
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:17,320
see that Previously used you we use ignore case sensitivity Now in compile operation,

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,380
you can also use flags Then only you can get your remaining fight owns because we are

167
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,750
looking for cattle P right?

168
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,570
No,

169
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,340
see there flags equals two r e not I.

170
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,550
So company operation on method is also supporting flags operations Now see the result.

171
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,850
That's it.

172
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,900
So this,

173
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,390
I think,

174
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:47,450
is that Let me right there on simple Suppose if you're using already dot Find all you are

175
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:58,650
part on then your string This we are doing in this way already dot Compile you are part run

176
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,780
dot final This is exactly of course,

177
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,940
with this thing I mean any operation you can come back in this way So I did not find on now

178
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,320
we are doing our dot com pale.

179
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,450
First we're creating an object using your patterns on the doctor were performing or

180
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,150
operation.

181
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,730
You can also start.

182
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,190
These are put into some variable.

183
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,950
That's what I did,

184
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,540
