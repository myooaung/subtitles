1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
difference here.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,920
We're going to write Very simple Bite on Skip.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,450
And that is simply printing some message.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,140
So here,

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,900
I'm going to print hello Word using your python script and what I would escape.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,390
You're going to write that I'm going to write using V am on default ideally.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,410
So here.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,350
We're going to see a simple bite on strip by using either we Emily that or default Ideally

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,430
right,

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,960
Let me weapon First off all my common line on my Windows operating system,

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,160
you can write same program,

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,650
same script on your Lennox or any UNIX like systems as well,

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,610
right?

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,110
So,

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,310
guys,

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,430
I'm moving into my desktop there.

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,140
I'm going to create Python script territory.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,660
Let me enter into that so as have no you don't know anything in this directory night.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,300
See if you want to use via murder.

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,070
First of all,

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,650
you should have the am only what host?

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,150
So you know what previous video?

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,330
We have seen different types off Raiders and I'll give any link to install we America on

24
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:10,800
your windows.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,140
Troubling system anywhere.

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,390
Biting for the V i e.

27
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,240
Is there on your UNIX like systems you can use We I on what?

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,160
UNIX like systems,

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,680
but it windows you don't have.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,070
Yea,

31
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,550
but you can install William.

32
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,310
Right?

33
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,850
So I already installed that.

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,450
No.

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,130
Let me run,

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,750
William.

37
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,300
Simply Hello word Not be what you can take any name.

38
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,750
Grace.

39
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,560
Any script name you can take on extension is dot the way just to know that there is a fight

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,050
on script.

41
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,610
What?

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,450
Fight on program?

43
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,340
No,

44
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,750
let me under Were young space some program name 0.3 way right now I'm going to a weapon.

45
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,940
We were V.

46
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,880
I am a reader.

47
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,050
I open that right?

48
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,210
See,

49
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,610
guys,

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,050
my intention is I had to write a some pie transcript or fight on program.

51
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:05,830
And if I run that program I had to get output are simply some hello world,

52
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,550
right?

53
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,030
Soto print to something toe prints some texture,

54
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,440
Mrs.

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
Or string in your python.

56
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,720
You're to use print simply but And this is in double condition.

57
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,370
You had to write your text,

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,250
our message,

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,610
our string Whatever you want to print through your pipes on program.

60
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,810
That's it.

61
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,350
So print parentheses,

62
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,570
then inside parentheses with quotations.

63
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,120
You hard right?

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,250
Some string or Mrs or text,

65
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,850
right?

66
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,720
No.

67
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,690
Let me say this first.

68
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,650
Observe your script.

69
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,120
Whatever you help.

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,350
So this is our script,

71
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,650
right?

72
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,050
So this is like in Windows Cat Common,

73
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,860
right?

74
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,840
I am seeing my file.

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,590
My program?

76
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,250
My script?

77
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,080
Yes.

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,350
This is the line in my program.

79
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,880
Okay,

80
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,550
so now I'm going to run it,

81
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,910
fight on.

82
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,510
So I say,

83
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,900
if you want to run your script by town,

84
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,180
skip,

85
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,750
you are to run in this way on your windows operating systems by dawn.

86
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,160
Space your program name.

87
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,150
But before going to that ticket whether you configure your fight on on your host or not,

88
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,320
Yes,

89
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,290
I am getting some watching.

90
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,990
Means I have a fight on on my host on that wasn't in some theaters under Jiro.

91
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,250
Now I can use bite on space.

92
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,910
Hello.

93
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,350
Work?

94
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,700
Not really.

95
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,650
See that Put their getting hello world.

96
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,950
Right?

97
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,880
So you guys here,

98
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,210
you have to understand one more thing while running.

99
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,780
You're running in this way.

100
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:45,390
Fight on space Your hello world dot The way some program name dot The way now as off No,

101
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,750
I am using pi country.

102
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,750
Right?

103
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,860
So if I want to run same program with fight on three.

104
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,690
So Allie,

105
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,500
how somewhere in my host.

106
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,650
Fight on two as well,

107
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,130
Right?

108
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,280
Let me run with Python.

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,010
So you have to probably complete part because you contact two parts to your system parts.

110
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,050
That's why I'm selecting.

111
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,400
Bite on three as the default one on poor piped onto whenever.

112
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,350
If I want to run my python script with fight on two,

113
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,050
I will probably the complete part for my fight on to wash in.

114
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,670
So my bite onto is that in this location,

115
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,440
if you want to check,

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,980
you can check abortion right now.

117
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,480
If you want to run your script of using fight on two just provided complete part where you

118
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,530
install your python,

119
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,610
then your program name or skip name.

120
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,050
See that?

121
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,850
That's it.

122
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,850
Okay,

123
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,890
on you guys.

124
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,000
Whatever we return,

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,990
write that script.

126
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,650
We are running from common line,

127
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,950
so there's the first thing you have to know,

128
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,010
because as an automation,

129
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,650
you know you have to run your scripts from command line.

130
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,850
We already discussed this point Fine.

131
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,980
So there's if you want to write one more line,

132
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,050
so I want to print output like a lower or welcome to fight on.

133
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,890
So this is in one line.

134
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,450
I want to print one more line,

135
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,750
then bring in quotations Whatever you want to print it just right that the information here

136
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,750
.

137
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,950
So I am writing Welcome to fight on scripting If you want,

138
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,140
right,

139
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,920
One more line,

140
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,390
Let's say print.

141
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,150
This is my first script.

142
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:34,120
So now through our pie transcript we are printing three lines off information with the help

143
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,850
of this a script.

144
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,250
Let me save it.

145
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,550
And after the output,

146
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,350
I mean first of your script.

147
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,370
No money.

148
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,850
Enter seed output.

149
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,200
Whatever you how inside off your print inside off your quotations That information is

150
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,740
printing underlies whenever.

151
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,320
If you're on your python program,

152
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,050
it will run from top to bottom line by line,

153
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,000
Right,

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,850
Very first line.

155
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,170
Hello,

156
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,700
World 40.

157
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,910
This information will be print then this one,

158
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,650
then this one.

159
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,640
Right?

160
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,170
So there is a simple script with your fight on and here we written our script with help off

161
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,990
William on.

162
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,750
We are running that with fight on three as well as fight on to also right.

163
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,550
So there's if you're having confusion like running simply by python or by providing

164
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,850
complete fight on pot,

165
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,820
right?

166
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,240
Just try to install only one python on your host on said the part for your fight on.

167
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,590
I'm just trying to work with that.

168
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:44,250
Only right in guessing fell both the fight on washings on your host just to provide your

169
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,490
just.

170
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,970
Are your fight on part of your system part for only anyone of the fight on washing it?

171
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,950
Maybe two or three,

172
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,740
right?

173
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,370
Aren't come to command line on.

174
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,850
Just type in this way.

175
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,400
Suppose here.

176
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,280
If you're getting three dot sound or Jiro,

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,270
then by default,

178
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,750
you're running your python programs with help off fight on three oceans.

179
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,840
So if you want to run this program with any other abortion,

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,230
just try to power complete part off your pie tone Interpreter.

181
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,350
That is nothing but fight under E x e.

182
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,390
Of course.

183
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,140
Morning to provide dot Txt by default,

184
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,350
it will take dot txt extension because you are only work with those offering system.

185
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,350
That's it.

186
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,350
Okay.

187
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,560
On here,

188
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,010
guys,

189
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,450
I need to probably one more clarity observed that in your script,

190
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,810
right?

191
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,200
This entire thing is a string or text.

192
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,950
Our message,

193
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,060
right?

194
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,080
Actually see the string.

195
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,670
If you want to print any string on your common line while running your program always You

196
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,200
have to take it.

197
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,450
Bring See Here This is a number,

198
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:45,750
right?

199
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,790
Number is also your string If you provide inside off your quotation stringing a demon group

200
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,490
off characters If you write anything inside operations that will be history.

201
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,850
That is always history.

202
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,910
If you write anything inside of quotations that is always a string.

203
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:08,630
So print is used to simply to print some string on your common line on your terminal on

204
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,750
your display while running your program.

205
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,250
We're learning your script,

206
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,850
right?

207
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,950
