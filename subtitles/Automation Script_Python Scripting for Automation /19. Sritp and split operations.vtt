00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
friends here.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.300
We're going to discuss two more very,

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.510
very important string operations in your real time.

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.550
They are like script and split.

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.820
So to explain this,

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.800
let me weapon our first of all,

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.540
come online.

8
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.090
Then let me enter into my fight on command line.

9
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.850
Let's say I have a string call fight on.

10
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.350
Okay,

11
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.840
then let me simply print your ex on by mistake Instead of defining in this way,

12
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.350
I have given some fight on.

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.240
And honestly,

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.710
I provide a space before starting your string on that space is preserving even while

15
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.730
printing your own put.

16
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.350
But while printing if there is any space,

17
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.730
maybe at starting side off your given string or the an inside off your given string Clear.

18
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.710
Unwanted Lee I provided that are by mistake how given that space,

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.990
I want to remove that in.

20
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.870
Guess if there is a space either side off your given string.

21
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.380
I mean,

22
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.450
towards left side and towards right side.

23
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.730
See that first up there?

24
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.150
There.

25
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.560
You're getting your space here and here right now.

26
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.320
Let me do exit door.

27
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.710
No,

28
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.860
See,

29
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770
that would put you don't know any space not put aside.

30
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.570
So extort strip will remove by the four if there is any space towards left or towards right

31
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.970
side or extreme sites only starting or the ending that space will remove by your strip

32
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.650
operation.

33
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.460
Actually,

34
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.610
by default strip will remove the space.

35
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.510
But I want to remove something like,

36
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.450
let's say I have a string now call in this way.

37
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.450
Fight on.

38
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.780
Now I want to remove letter P or letter again from your given stream because he's did at

39
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.580
the starting site.

40
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.890
I want to remove that P.

41
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.750
Then I can do extort strip,

42
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.910
See the he is removing or I want to remove yen.

43
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.470
Now see that any is removing.

44
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.150
But if I want to remove something quality,

45
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.880
it won't do because he's not there either.

46
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.770
It's starting site Oregon inside.

47
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.830
So if any character or were,

48
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.070
if it is there either,

49
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.940
and starting side ordered an inside of your given string,

50
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.060
then that will remove.

51
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.380
Let's say I'm going to take a bite on.

52
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.650
Scripting is easy.

53
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.880
No,

54
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.950
What I want to do is I want to remove easy then X Dark ST.

55
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.910
If easy is,

56
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.410
there,

57
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.250
either are starting side or it and inside.

58
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.020
Then that will remove yesterday's removing right now.

59
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.160
Suppose if you're given string is in this way.

60
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.130
Now I want to remove item only towards right side.

61
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.990
Not are the starting side this bite and I don't want to remove I want to remove only

62
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.510
despite on this is a bright side,

63
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.850
right,

64
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.160
So that's what you gotta do is simply print extort Strip right Strip our strip Remove bite

65
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.430
on See the output It does remain What is removing only at right side If I remove And if I

66
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.530
play simplest trip operation it is going to remove your fight on both the sides So same way

67
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.420
you can remove your butler word even at left side Also by doing else trip So strip l strip

68
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.630
our strip like fine No,

69
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.760
let's say I have a string called Bite on something in this way.

70
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.530
Okay,

71
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:46.720
now I want to remove dar slash I Currently I can do it ex dot Strip So that result I want

72
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.860
to start index itself.

73
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.850
Suppose X equals two x adored strip.

74
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.120
I want to remove door slash I if anything,

75
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.850
is there either starting side or in inside.

76
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.540
On that result again,

77
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.850
I stored into my ex See that.

78
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.250
And let's say how in this way String bite on.

79
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.550
Okay.

80
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.500
No,

81
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.420
Something called way,

82
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.750
Way.

83
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.680
So I want to remove letter p on.

84
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.550
Why in sequence I mean,

85
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.450
first I can do extort strip,

86
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.820
because off this,

87
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.110
you're going to remove P and again on the same operation.

88
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.650
I can do one more door operation that his wife see that.

89
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.680
So I mean,

90
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.260
my people times you can apply dot strip operation or combination off strip.

91
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.940
I'm our strip are even else trip also you cannot play likewise.

92
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.950
You can do any number of times dot strip dot strip give business requirement.

93
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.780
We just try to remember the functionality off the dot strip operation on your given string

94
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.780
.

95
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.320
Ok,

96
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.940
While writing or real time scripts there we will see how to use a securities.

97
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.900
A stripper pressure?

98
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.590
No,

99
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.990
Let me go with the the next operation that is split.

100
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.950
So if I know simply extorts plates,

101
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.550
seed output,

102
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.950
Vanover spaces There.

103
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.490
Right there it is putting your given string.

104
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.070
So to places you have a space that for a given string is getting into three parts Foster

105
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.120
parts Second part,

106
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.520
third part right?

107
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.190
Actually,

108
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.750
this format is call a list.

109
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.450
We have a data structure called Liston.

110
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.220
There will discuss in depth of it list operations as off.

111
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.490
No,

112
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.780
just up the exit door split Will do the A list off.

113
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.250
Put on how it is going to spit based on space by default.

114
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.630
But I want to split a given string.

115
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.310
Where a word called.

116
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.680
Is there no Caesar?

117
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.190
Put wherever easy is there.

118
00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.690
There it is.

119
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.710
Going to split now.

120
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.060
As off.

121
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.200
No,

122
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.740
you have only one easy.

123
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.610
That's why it disease.

124
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.210
One part.

125
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.150
And this is one party or getting two parts.

126
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.950
Foster part second part.

127
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.580
Let's say your taxes in this way on three days.

128
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.910
Ready?

129
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.110
Popular?

130
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.800
No,

131
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.230
in this.

132
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.300
In this case,

133
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.250
if I spit with ease you how is here under here.

134
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.590
So to places you how you will get three parts Foster,

135
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.570
part second part third part.

136
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.180
You're going to get a list which consist off three values.

137
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.850
Sit output,

138
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.870
first value,

139
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.830
second value,

140
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.850
and then Third Valley.

141
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.090
Right.

142
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.400
So these are the very,

143
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.350
very important operations in your real time.

144
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.950
Strip and split.

145
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.950
Okay.

146
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.270
Okay.

147
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.750
Thank you for watching this video.
