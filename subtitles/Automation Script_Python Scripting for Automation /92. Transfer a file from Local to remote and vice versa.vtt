please.

4
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.140
How to transfer a file from local server to remote server on Dwight's Forsa using para my

5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.420
Cough python Simply you're having one local server and you're having one remote server.

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.100
Just assume there.

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.250
Now,

8
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.390
suppose some file is there on your local server.

9
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.180
I need to transfer this file to your remote,

10
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.350

sir?

14
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.710
Where?

15
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.670
I don't know that file to your local server And these all actions I want to perform with

16
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.550
the help of Para Micro off your python are simply pattern Michael model.

17
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.560
All right,

18
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.250
let me explain this with simply a simple Corp.

19
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.020
So friends salary.

20
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.400
We know how your parent,

21
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.920
my commodity,

22
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.760
is going toe work from our previous video.

23
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.550
You are part of my commodity is going toe work by creating It's a city plane,

24
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.150
I Anyway,

25
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.410
you're using Father Michael.

26
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.860
That's why first ofall unity,

27
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.890
important model.

28
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.250
Then you need to create a society Klein,

29
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.950
right?

30
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.620
So you know how to create as a static line?

31
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.150
There is a simple is intact for that.

32
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.830
Then after that,

33
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.130
you need to add auto our policy.

34
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.850
This is just to avoid Ah,

35
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.550
uh,

36
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.920
like asking yes or no confirmation.

37
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.600
While connecting with your remorse over the very first time are simply it is going toe.

38
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.050
Add to your known coast on your local server.

39
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.750
That's fine.

40
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.950
There are for their Let me try to connect with the or Third World.

41
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.590
So you know how to connect with your server.

42
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.580
So simply using this Ssh!

43
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.190
We clear a connection with your remote server on what are the connection we establish that

44
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.950
will be pointed with help off message object are as such a client.

45
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.880
That's it.

46
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.230
No,

47
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.050
I suppose.

48
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.190
Yes,

49
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.470
Actually,

50
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.900
I forgot.

51
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.180
Toe,

52
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.020
give this point in your previous Rio,

53
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.100
that is once.

54
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.590
If your if your work is done with the help off your ascetic line finally can also close

55
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.090
your ssh client connection.

56
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.890
You know,

57
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.290
if you don't close by default,

58
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.610
it will be closed off for some time.

59
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.620
But it is better practice to close us.

60
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.470
A city client,

61
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.150
once you were work is done with your ssh decline.

62
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.300
That's fine.

63
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.610
So using this as a static line,

64
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.360
you can exclude some comments.

65
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.280
But here our requirement is when he could transfer the file to your remote server.

66
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.660
Are we condoning the file from your remote server?

67
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.170
So for that you need to create from this city.

68
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.300
Klein one sftp object on sftp connection.

69
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.010
So for that,

70
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.370
we have a simple sandbags.

71
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.150
See that?

72
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.690
Let me open my court.

73
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.900
So,

74
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.340
guys here,

75
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.980
I'm going to write simply sftp client object are simply connection with help off sftp such

76
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.950
klein dot Open a 70 be.

77
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.550
That's it.

78
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.630
No.

79
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.310
With help off this 50 line,

80
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.960
we are opening sftp connection with your remote server.

81
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.150
Now,

82
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.450
using this sftp client object or connection,

83
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.250
we can transfer the file our work and don't really file from your remote server.

84
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.680
Now,

85
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.650
see that I'm listing the operations which are there with your sftp Klein.

86
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.820
So you are having different types off operations.

87
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.220
Suppose if you want to change the way ownership off your file on your remote server,

88
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.450
then you can use sftp underscore client adore change one of sleep,

89
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.500
right?

90
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.560
Like ways we hold.

91
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.230
Ah,

92
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.260
suppose kind working.

93
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.400
Undoubtedly right now.

94
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.860
See that.

95
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.000
Let me go on show you that.

96
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.310
And one more thing here also once If your work is done with your sftp client,

97
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.520
you can also close this sftp connection or session.

98
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.140
So be clear before sftp Klein don't close s message because you are a safety piece

99
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.570
depending on where it's a such a client.

100
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.150
Object or connection,

101
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.590
right?

102
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.050
See,

103
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.080
now what I'm doing is first let me weapon my remote server.

104
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.930
This is my remote's our work here.

105
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.070
How?

106
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.860
Some files.

107
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.250
Let's say I'm having a file called Para mako.

108
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.080
Don't know dot Txt In this we have some content and it could download this file on.

109
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.480
My locals are with help off fight on Marimekko,

110
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.680
then simplest in taxes.

111
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.820
See that sftp Klein don't get you are remorse server file with complete part.

112
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.110
Actually,

113
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.260
that is a good practice.

114
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.460
No,

115
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.990
let me take complete part home,

116
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.160
easy to user then this file name,

117
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.470
right?

118
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.250
See that home went right source Is it to user slash your files,

119
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.350
then on the local host.

120
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.320
So forget you have a source file under destination.

121
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.210
Get means don't morning file from remote server?

122
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.410
No.

123
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.450
Suppose I'm gladly giving,

124
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:33.850
but on my cool don't lord it file dot Txt.

125
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.550
See,

126
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.950
I'm not giving complete part.

127
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.250
Just I'm giving the file name in which you want to store this remote file content.

128
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.270
So whenever you feel on your bike landscape in which location despite landscape,

129
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.270
is there there it is going to don't lord enough that if you want to store in any required

130
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.630
part,

131
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.660
then you have to provide complete part on your Windows server anyway,

132
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.160
as off.

133
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.410
No,

134
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.150
I'm running this court from my Windows server.

135
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.300
Right.

136
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.750
See,

137
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.950
in our case,

138
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.720
local server,

139
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.430
remote server.

140
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.570
I knew our remote salaries Line X and locals are I'm taking as windows.

141
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.950
Any combination will work,

142
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.220
right?

143
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.680
No.

144
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.110
See that.

145
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.330
Let me save it Underneath it's done.

146
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.100
Let me go toe open my location where we have this server.

147
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.450
I mean this script,

148
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.930
but I'm mike O'Donnell file dot txt para Michael.

149
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.750
Don't load it.

150
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.780
Filed Arctic Sea.

151
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.590
So there's the file.

152
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.940
Just No,

153
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.690
we don't want it.

154
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.680
Right.

155
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.950
So,

156
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.120
guys,

157
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.900
this is the way how we condone Lord right now.

158
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.650
One more thing.

159
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.960
I want to download this file,

160
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.150
but ah,

161
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.450
we thought mentioned this pop sometimes,

162
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.020
you know,

163
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.940
to move into a different location over sftp,

164
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.730
then very hard on with the file without mentioning the path.

165
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.990
Yes,

166
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.910
we can do it that also very simple.

167
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.910
See there before going to.

168
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.330
Don't lore ever filed what we had to do?

169
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.310
These we need to move our sftp connection are we need to change the location off your sftp

170
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.900
client Object on your remotes.

171
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.770
That word by using changed territory operation.

172
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.900
So now I'm going to suppose.

173
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.740
Read Ah,

174
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.040
group.

175
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.150
It is C location,

176
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.430
eloquent deck,

177
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.280
simply home.

178
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.450
Easy to user.

179
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.910
Right now,

180
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.750
Let me simply print current location point paid by your sftp Klein.

181
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.150
So simply you can get current working data to be with this Impax.

182
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.720
See,

183
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.890
that would put Now you're a separate piece pointing to this location.

184
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.810
So in this location,

185
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.870
whatever the file you are having that file we thought mentioned complete part you condone,

186
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.130

201
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.190
That's why even ever If you're mentioning your part,

202
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.020
it is always good to mention two slashes in your part.

203
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.050
But what if you're providing your part manually?

204
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.160
Now,

205
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.550
let me save it on running.

206
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.790

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.930
That's it.

213
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.750
So the the way how we can mention complete part on your local server are how do mention

214
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.610
complete part on your remotes or what we thought mentioned your complete path?

215
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.050
If you want to,

216
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:05.560
don't really file first a change or sftp client winding path on your remote server by using

217
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.550
change that three.

218
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.490
That's it.

219
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.510
Right?

220
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.730

221
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.480
Now I want to transfer the file from local server two remotes at work.

222
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.550
