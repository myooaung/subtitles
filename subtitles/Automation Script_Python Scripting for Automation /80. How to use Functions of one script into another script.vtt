ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
friends here.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.090
We're going to see how to use functions off.

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.500
One fight on script in tow,

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.430
Another pie transcript and what is underscoring the school name?

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.370
Variable on.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.760
Finally,

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.250
we're going to see how to create user defined modules.

8
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.670
First,

9
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.350
let me start with a simple by transcript.

10
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.050
Let me create a simple python skeptical skipped one dot b y.

11
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.600
Now here I'm going to define two functions.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.850
One is for addition.

13
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.510
No,

14
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:45.370
let me bring the edition off he and be He's simply K plus B.

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:56.810
Then let me write Return none and liberate one more function Subtraction off EECOM a B.

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:09.550
So drink the subtraction off you r e a and the East,

17
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.970
So simply a minus be not a no no.

18
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.000
Fine.

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270
Now these are the two functions.

20
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.510
Now let us assume that we have two variables.

21
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.150
Let's say,

22
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.580
uh,

23
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.550
exit goes to some number and why coastal some?

24
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.790
Now I want to get the addition and subtraction for these two numbers.

25
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.280
So already we defined functions.

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.550
So that's why I simply I'm calling addition Function bypassing X come away.

27
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.110
And next time I'm calling subtraction function simply by calling your ex envoy No,

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.220
Let me say we don't own it.

29
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.550
What happened?

30
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.790
Okay,

31
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.450
spell mystic.

32
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.010
Now see the result.

33
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.390
You're getting 11 and 37 place for 11 7 minus 43 you're getting That's fine.

34
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.850
Now,

35
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.990
this is your script one.

36
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.720
No,

37
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.280
Actually,

38
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.650
I want to write one more skip,

39
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.520
but there I want to find addition,

40
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.350
subtraction and multiplication off two numbers,

41
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.450
right?

42
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.380
So what?

43
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.700
I can do one thing directly.

44
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.850
I can copy these two functions here,

45
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.550
and I converted one more function simply for multiplication.

46
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.780
Right?

47
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.160
The multiplication off year.

48
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.190
And be He's simply you.

49
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.000
And don't be.

50
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.220
That's fine.

51
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.910
But as off no,

52
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.570
just before your addition.

53
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.220
Subtraction.

54
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.830
You are having very simple lines.

55
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.670
Just a gender.

56
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.620
You are writing it.

57
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.650
We're in real time.

58
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.850
Right?

59
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.720
So there how you held for a function.

60
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.340
Some 100 lines first of for addition function just a June that 1st 4 started can function

61
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.710
your 100 lines for subtraction function your 100 lights then unnecessarily are going toe

62
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.120
Copy.

63
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.260
200 lines off according to your current.

64
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.950
The script from your previous trip.

65
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.230
Now what I want to do is I don't want to copy these two functions here,

66
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.050
but I want to use directly from Scripture one.

67
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.250
You're additionally subtraction functions I want to use directly from your script work?

68
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.130
No.

69
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.580
First of all,

70
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.130
let me do the second script.

71
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.800
Name us.

72
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.650
Skip could put out the way.

73
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.560
I Fine.

74
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.350
No.

75
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.430
First of all,

76
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.650
let me define are any two variables.

77
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.110
So I'm defending then on one B right festival simply.

78
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.550
I'm finding multiplication off your Exxon way from your current scrip itself.

79
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.630
Yes,

80
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.750
you are getting your result.

81
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.950
But now I need to find addition and subtraction off this x camera.

82
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.260
Wait.

83
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.320
I'm in x and y variables so directly I can buy their logic.

84
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.880
But my intention is,

85
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.450
if already function is there in any other strip how we can use that in the current script,

86
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.950
Right.

87
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.940
So first of all,

88
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.280
what I'm doing is I'm going to commend these lines White.

89
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.870
I really,

90
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.230
but actually should not disturb other others to script.

91
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.550
Right.

92
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.630
But as off No,

93
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.550
just I'm commending.

94
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.150
Fine.

95
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.220
No,

96
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.590
we are under skipper too,

97
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.900
but we want to use the functions from script one.

98
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.990
So in that case,

99
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.140
what you gotta do is foster fall at very first lane.

100
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.900
Simply you have to write import script one don't write.

101
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.560
Not the way important script of one so that his crypto one.

102
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.830
Right?

103
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.910
So we are importing Scripture one.

104
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.190
That's it.

105
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.150
Now let me run it and see the output.

106
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.990
There is no other.

107
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.300
Now,

108
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.310
in script one,

109
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.440
you have functions anyway.

110
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.010
Addition and subtraction.

111
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.950
Right?

112
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.600
So in case,

113
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.570
if you want to know,

114
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.020
what are the functions are there in the script one that we have a loss Accord D a r See

115
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.750
that addition and subtraction functions up there.

116
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.190
Right?

117
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.590
Anyway,

118
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.130
we know that.

119
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:39.240
What are the functions are there in stripped one know what I'm doing is from script one.

120
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.250
I want to call addition.

121
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.940
Now my values are and 20.

122
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.970
Then what is the result then place 20 addition.

123
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.810
30 are getting now from script one.

124
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.740
I need to call subtraction as well.

125
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.850
Then you're going to get minus tan.

126
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.520
Not to Right now,

127
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.290
we are not writing any logic for addition and subtraction in the current script.

128
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.110
What we're doing already we have a functions for addition and subtraction in another street

129
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.110
.

130
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.350
We're trying to use that logic by importing your script One.

131
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.210
So first of all these the way how we can use other script of functions in the current

132
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.650
descript.

133
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.540
That's fine.

134
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.300
But while doing this process,

135
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.850
we did.

136
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.080
We committed this court,

137
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.520
but actually,

138
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.450
you should not come in.

139
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.180
We got that.

140
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.430
Someone's cool,

141
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.780
right?

142
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.880
You should not go on disturbed that big fear.

143
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.120
Now I'm going to run our court.

144
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.830
Let me run it.

145
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.350
Only for tradition.

146
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.430
Okay,

147
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.890
First of all,

148
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.710
let me commended.

149
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.700
So why I am commending,

150
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.880
you know,

151
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.710
to get clarity,

152
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.120
right?

153
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.540
Actually,

154
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.430
should not come in.

155
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.120
First of all,

156
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.590
let me run this and see the reason So addition,

157
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.260
off 10 and 20 years.

158
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.350
30 you're getting now this is scripted one.

159
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.600
Right now your script is there as it is.

160
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.050
We uncommitted that court,

161
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.980
right?

162
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.700
We don't know What is.

163
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.110
The logic is there in script one,

164
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.820
but we know only addition.

165
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.750
Function is needed from stripped one.

166
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.260
That's why simply I'm importing script one and I'm calling addition from China from that No

167
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.260
,

168
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.650
let me run it and see the results.

169
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.760
Actually,

170
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.240
unit only this outwork.

171
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.350
But why you are getting these two lines?

172
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.010
This is for skip.

173
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.430
The one purpose not for us,

174
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.750
right?

175
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.650
Whatever the logic,

176
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.660
you're getting old port right.

177
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.430
This is for stripped.

178
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.200
One purpose,

179
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.990
not for us.

180
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.660
We need Onley addition for 10 and 20.

181
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.010
We need only this or put why you are getting an insult.

182
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.850
These two lines,

183
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.550
right?

184
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.160
So that's why generally,

185
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.240
while implementing by transcript,

186
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.580
you need to follow some procedure.

187
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.350
Some steps they are.

188
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.450
Let me write it.

189
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.020
The first awful guys.

190
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.840
What will happen whenever If you try to import any script or any module,

191
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.450
there's like importing more delight.

192
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.480
Save anybody.

193
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.050
If we import script one,

194
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.860
your python will go on.

195
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.550
Exclude your script one first.

196
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.430
So while excluding script one,

197
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.030
what will happen?

198
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.970
There's a script,

199
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:11.630
one core.

200
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.850
Your fighting is going to explode from top down.

201
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.750
Well,

202
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.640
excluding from top down in script one.

203
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:17.950
Also,

204
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.900
we have addition,

205
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.950
subtraction calling.

206
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.750
So that's why you're going to get output for these two.

207
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.520
But we don't want that in our current scared.

208
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.390
We don't want that right.

209
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.900
So that's why generally,

210
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.750
while implementing any script,

211
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.900
right,

212
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:42.480
you have to write some main function inside off that main function Intertoto exclude your

213
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.650
main logic.

214
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:55.430
So these the first ofall standard way to write the scripts using Fight On Right now we're

215
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.900
calling me even though if you do this still,

216
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.750
you're going to get same or put after that.

217
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.280
No,

218
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.350
I'm running rerunning.

219
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.980
See the result?

220
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.630
A missile or getting to line Soft,

221
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.950
core,

222
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.790
extra core.

223
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.050
But I want to get only this line.

224
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.450
I don't want these two lines,

225
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.730
right.

226
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.150
So that's why what I'm doing is while calling main function and stripped one,

227
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.600
I'm writing a simple logic.

228
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.550
Don't worry.

229
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:33.190
First after the output right now.

230
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.380
See,

231
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:33.800
there isn't.

232
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.980
I'm running now.

233
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.990
You're not getting You are skipped,

234
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.220
Owen.

235
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.680
Output.

236
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.900
You're getting only from scripted toward port.

237
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.300
That's this is what we need,

238
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.390
right?

239
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.440
The same way.

240
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.140
Whenever.

241
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.260
If you're writing code,

242
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.250
you need to follow this structure for your python.

243
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.290
Then that is a good bye.

244
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:52.810
Transcript.

245
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.120
That's it.

246
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.850
Nothing is there.

247
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.480
So how you are going?

248
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.930
Toe war?

249
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.440
Come getting output from script one.

250
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.330
I will show you.

251
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.350
I will explain that.

252
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:09.870
No,

253
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:17.860
that's it.

254
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.030
So that on go to your script one on grand.

255
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.780
You skipped one.

256
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.850
So you're going to get your skip on our food as well,

257
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.170
right?

258
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.550
There is no change in output.

259
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.650
It's working perfectly.

260
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.470
Right?

261
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.610
So now you need to understand about.

262
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.750
Name variable.

263
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.340
Underscore.

264
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.840
Underscore.

265
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.170
Name.

266
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.670
Underscore.

267
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.250
Underscore.

268
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.050
Right,

269
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.950
Fine.

270
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.830
Now,

271
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.400
see,

272
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.050
First let me come in and they're court in your script,

273
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.950
One as well as instructed.

274
00:10:50.950 --> 00:11:00.690
Now,

275
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:08.150
what I'm doing is simply am bringing underscore Underscore name.

276
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.260
That is a variable like X.

277
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.450
Really find variable,

278
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.090
right?

279
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.720
I'm running.

280
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.300
See the result?

281
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.350
What you're getting mean?

282
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.950
The same way.

283
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.060
The variable even.

284
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.950
I'm trying to print from your second strip as well.

285
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.350
You're getting made,

286
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.260
right?

287
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.770
Know what I'm doing?

288
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:33.210
Is this is from Steptoe one,

289
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:33.730
right?

290
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.290
Not admitting it.

291
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.260
Yes,

292
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:36.750
that's fine.

293
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.440
No,

294
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.650
somebody I'm trying to right here.

295
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:51.990
This is from script to No,

296
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.200
let me down its fine.

297
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.740
So when I'm very few if you're running your script to and if you are printing underscore

298
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.630
underscore name were able value You are getting made are in Scripture one also whenever if

299
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.340
you try to print underscoring the school name Underscore Underscore name variable value.

300
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.070
You're getting main.

301
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.410
Only with underscores,

302
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.890
right?

303
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.550
That's fine.

304
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:22.750
Now what I'm doing is I'm trying to import to strip the one right.

305
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.690
See,

306
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.840
whenever a few important skipped one first.

307
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.590
What your python will do means you're Brighton will go on exclude completely script one

308
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.690
because off this line,

309
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.270
Because off this line you're fighting will go on eggs.

310
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.050
Good Your script One first completely right?

311
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.000
What stopped it?

312
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.450
Output.

313
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.120
This is from script one,

314
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.450
but what you're getting you're getting stupid one not mean on because off this line this is

315
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.010
from Scripture.

316
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.600
Do you're getting a main?

317
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.530
That means whenever If you run any skipper directly,

318
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.090
then name variable value.

319
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:11.950
Easy cause to Maine with underscores the variable name is main but we are running this name

320
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.750
discord indirectly from scripted too right?

321
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.800
Skipped one means you're important Script one means you're running script one court.

322
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.350
But you're running indirectly from Scripture too.

323
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.020
You are not running directly,

324
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.570
Stripling,

325
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:30.180
We are not running This core directly scripted to is earning script one court In that case

326
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:30.180
,

327
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:40.030
that name variable value is equals to script one not mean be clear If you run simply,

328
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.420
you were core directly on.

329
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.120
In that case,

330
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.150
your variable value these main.

331
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:53.270
But if you run any core indirectly if you after year important script one is running

332
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.250
because off script to why learning scripted.

333
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.620
So you're also running Steptoe.

334
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.140
That means skipper to is running stripped one.

335
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.220
You're not directly running Script one.

336
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.500
So at that time,

337
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.260
whatever the variable is there inside off Script one.

338
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.550
That variable name variable value will become the name off that script,

339
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.450
right?

340
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.550
No,

341
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.280
I've got it here.

342
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.730
No,

343
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.040
Let me come in the score.

344
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.310
No,

345
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.460
because off import script one,

346
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.170
what will happen?

347
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:34.310
Your core will run from Tartu down because off script A one important script one I mean

348
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.810
from Scripture Toe you are important Scripture one my number.

349
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.050
If you do import a script one at that time,

350
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.630
what will happen?

351
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.130
Your python will run first.

352
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.250
Entire script one Right now After that in Scripture one What we help.

353
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:53.890
So why learning your skip one from taco down function anyway of Brighton Would eggs good as

354
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.040
off?

355
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.220
No function here by then.

356
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.110
Won't exude as off no function again.

357
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.470
You're right.

358
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.410
And want eggs Good as off.

359
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.540
No,

360
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.650
simply to remember all these three functions.

361
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.600
No,

362
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.250
this is the main line if underscore Underscore Name.

363
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.350
So you are not running directly?

364
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.760
This a script one You're stupid too is running.

365
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.950
That's why name value is equal subscript one Now this is equal subscript one not may know,

366
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.330
right.

367
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.800
If we script one,

368
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.990
then they are not equal,

369
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.220
right?

370
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.150
This value and this really they're not equal.

371
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.550
If they are not equal than if doesn't allergy eggs Good main function.

372
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.070
It doesn't alert toe called main function.

373
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.020
If you're not calling main function,

374
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.680
then you are not calling these lines.

375
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.030
If you're not calling the insolence,

376
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.050
then you are not getting any or put from function.

377
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.470
One sorry from Scripture.

378
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.770
Well,

379
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:49.440
in Scripture do that's it so that you are going toe what you're doing that you are going

380
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.350
toe a wire getting output from script one.

381
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:59.460
So you're going to get output only whenever If you call functions right,

382
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.450
I will see that now we are unscripted toe.

383
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:10.030
So whenever we feel on your fight on skateboard all happened Very first land in port.

384
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.270
Yes,

385
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.100
that will execute import script.

386
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.100
One is nothing but you're going to run script one anyway,

387
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.350
you know,

388
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.970
in skipped one.

389
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.590
What is the logic?

390
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.810
Is there right?

391
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:27.300
Then after execution off all the court from startled on what your python will do simply Or

392
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.850
Brighton will remember all the functions names,

393
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.270
that's it.

394
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.650
Then it will come back to script one?

395
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.330
No.

396
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:34.950
In script one,

397
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.540
we define one multiple.

398
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.990
I mean multiplication function.

399
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.250
One main function.

400
00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.330
Right?

401
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.450
But be clear already.

402
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.380
You know main function from here.

403
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.840
But that is from script one,

404
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.070
not from Scripture to know.

405
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.120
This is from Skipper Toe.

406
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.960
Arbeitman can distinguish that.

407
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.400
Then after that,

408
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.010
he homaine if underscore under school name equals two main,

409
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.510
right?

410
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.420
No,

411
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.860
you are running.

412
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.900
Scoop it directly.

413
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.470
That's why I named very.

414
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.660
But it was close to main.

415
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.080
Both are equal.

416
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.860
If what are equal your condition,

417
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.400
Will Oliver be exclude this mean?

418
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.350
Then you're coming to here.

419
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.090
Then exit coast attend.

420
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.280
Why close to 10 then?

421
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280
From script one.

422
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.850
You're calling addition.

423
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:27.110
Now you're fighting will go to script one and there it will try to extradition function.

424
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.610
Then we'll come back to here.

425
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.450
That's it.

426
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:35.010
Thank that's it.

427
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.350
So no.

428
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:45.130
By doing in this way what we're doing if you have just script one is now a model for your

429
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:45.840
skin too.

430
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.540
That's why you are importing script one.

431
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:53.190
Here I So there's no from no one words.

432
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.060
We're going forward whenever If you're trying to import your pipe.

433
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.410
Sorry,

434
00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.160
Nobody for tryingto create any pie transcript.

435
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.400
Now you need to follow this A structure.

436
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.340
But it is in case if you want to import anything,

437
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.330
you can import here.

438
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.690
Some this way.

439
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:15.950
So are I'm Some models are You can also import line by line import boys import I'm right

440
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.980
Import daytime model Let me save it.

441
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:33.120
New structure for bite on script Not be.

442
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:40.350
Wait right then offer that very first line is always it.

443
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.760
Probably import You try to write in this way if underscored in the school name because to

444
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.410
correction underscoring the score Main colon then call main function.

445
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:55.380
No title defined some very one main function Now from here on worse,

446
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.780
try to write your main lossy.

447
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.870
Suppose I want toe find the addition off any numbers.

448
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.010
Let's X equals two.

449
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.730
And why?

450
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.480
Because too no directly.

451
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.010
I don't want to find art.

452
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.620
If you want directly find yes,

453
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.590
simply write X plus y.

454
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.240
That's it.

455
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.740
Sorry,

456
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.760
Expressway,

457
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.270
Then simply.

458
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.210
This is a function.

459
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.940
That's why at the end,

460
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.410
just right,

461
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:17.680
right on,

462
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.050
man,

463
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:23.240
that's a But I don't want to directly right my addition here.

464
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.340
Then just try to define one function for that edition.

465
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.950
X come away somewhere just right.

466
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.950
Tradition function.

467
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.000
Come on,

468
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.050
Be Then I took bring the edition off.

469
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:45.520
They were You earn b is simply it.

470
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.710
Bless be Nazi.

471
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.510
So I'm not returning anything.

472
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.140
Simply right.

473
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.560
Return?

474
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.630
None.

475
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.430
That's what Now see the result.

476
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.760
You're getting same old put,

477
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.150
right?

478
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.540
So this while going forward,

479
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.160
please follow this structure.

480
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.930
Always try to start with your court with thief condition if underscore underscore name

481
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:12.900
equals two main then call main function and tried to write their logic from main function.

482
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.450
So what is that one days by writing this means whenever.

483
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.740
If you're trying to import discord in tow,

484
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:25.050
other scripts at the time you are awaiting exclusion off your main block.

485
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.920
In case if you don't write this Lozzi unnecessarily,

486
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.850
you're going to exude your court in other scripts,

487
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.510
right?

488
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.260
So So that's why while going forward,

489
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.490
we're trying to follow.

490
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.950
This is structure by lighting by transcripts,

491
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.400
right?

492
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.330
If you write in this way,

493
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.060
then there's nothing but creation off your one models.

494
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.340
Are you are defining your require models?

495
00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:52.640
What?

496
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.310
This is called user defined model.

497
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.050
That's it.

498
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.120
Simple way I'm explaining here.

499
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.580
Right.

500
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.420
Okay.

501
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.770
Thank you for watching this review.
