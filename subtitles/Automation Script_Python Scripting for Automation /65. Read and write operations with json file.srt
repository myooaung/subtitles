1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
friends here.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,550
We're going toe work with the Jason files using Fight on.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,300
What is Jason?

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,610
You know,

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,610
Jason is a javascript object notation,

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:21,420
and it is a popular data for March used for representing structure data guys before Jason.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,160
You know XML,

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,410
right?

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,850
What is the purpose of excitement?

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,550
The purpose affects Emily just will transform your data from server to application or from

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,940
application to server or simply server to client our client to server the same way we are

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,410
using even Jason as well.

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,750
Night.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,290
See,

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,750
let me show you a simple Jason file.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,110
So we have a simple Jason fight.

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,970
Let me open it.

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,280
Yeah,

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,510
I see.

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,850
Here,

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,690
this entire thing is one Jason file.

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,550
And if you have the in there,

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,450
do you How calibrates Starting on ending.

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,740
So in terms off fight on these a dictionary.

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,470
But as party or Jason,

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,750
this is a object.

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,450
You should say you're dictionary as object in your Jason.

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,650
Fine.

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,410
See,

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,800
for the same Jason file,

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,980
whatever the content to be represented.

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,450
I mean,

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,770
whatever they represent,

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,290
they're using this Jason former same better.

35
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,210
They're also going to represent using XML.

36
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:36,040
That means you can write your data to transmit over the network either by using XML or by

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,410
using Jason for simple er data.

38
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,900
We're going to use Jason format for complex city data.

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,450
We're going to use XML fight.

40
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,750
That's it.

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay,

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,310
fine.

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,500
No.

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,380
Let me copy this simple Jason file.

45
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,600
And I want to store it as a some with some Jason for,

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,090
Let's say,

47
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,150
my Jason,

48
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,550
nor does an extension.

49
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,350
So this is now your Jason file.

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,230
So what we are doing here is we want to read the Jason file.

51
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,490
Or if you want to write the content Dio Jason,

52
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,650
file how we can do it.

53
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,000
First,

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,150
let me go with the hold to religious and file.

55
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,250
So I'm going to store us.

56
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,970
I'm going to say program a script name as working with the here,

57
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,850
working with the Jason files,

58
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,450
right?

59
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,040
See,

60
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,350
guys when I'm But if you want to work with the Jason Foster fall Unity imported Jason

61
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,950
module,

62
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,010
which is a default model,

63
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,940
then let me take file or required Filed.

64
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,550
What is the file you want to read?

65
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,580
So they you know,

66
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,230
it is a better practice to provide complete part.

67
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,280
So as off Not ugly,

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm giving my dear son George s and file name itself without giving comfort part because

69
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,050
that Justin file on my script boat are there in the same location.

70
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,490
But anyway,

71
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,460
for better practice,

72
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,820
please,

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,040
please provide complete part for your file.

74
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,450
Many.

75
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,950
But if you're writing Python scripts,

76
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,500
that's fine.

77
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,350
No,

78
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,210
guys,

79
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,070
generally,

80
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,390
if we want to read a file,

81
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,260
if you want to read the content off a file,

82
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,150
what are our steps?

83
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,240
Weapon?

84
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,280
That filing read more.

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,150
That is a first step.

86
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,600
Open that file in.

87
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,370
Read more.

88
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,180
You know,

89
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,330
even if you don't mention anymore in weapon function by default,

90
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,490
that is the read more.

91
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,080
But if you want to mention yes,

92
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,950
you can mention it.

93
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,460
Read more then finally,

94
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,470
we are closing between these two.

95
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,380
Whatever the action you want to perform,

96
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,250
you can perform.

97
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,040
So this is not the normal text file.

98
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
If it is like a normal text.

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,260
If I logically we can print,

100
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,350
therefore dot Reid,

101
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,170
if it is normal extra file,

102
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,350
we can use this one like you're getting.

103
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,180
But you're getting like again.

104
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,030
This has a Jason only but what we need we want to work with the Giessen file.

105
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,870
That means you need to convert that data and took fight on.

106
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,950
Understandable Later.

107
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,060
Now,

108
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,330
again,

109
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,350
this is like a string.

110
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,150
They just your guests an object as it is.

111
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,750
But we don't want that Jason object.

112
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,550
Because if you want to modify,

113
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,770
if you want to get suppose,

114
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,330
let's say based on keys,

115
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,470
if it is victory based on this key,

116
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,650
you can get this value.

117
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,570
But no,

118
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,550
this is not a dictionary.

119
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,750
Then you can't do some process on this data like,

120
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,390
you know.

121
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,050
Ah,

122
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,550
give a look operations on your data because that is not a dictionary.

123
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,400
What happened?

124
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,480
Ah,

125
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,370
12 one more Parent is this?

126
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:41,750
Yeah.

127
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,430
So that is a string you're able to.

128
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,790
Really?

129
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,480
What data?

130
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,390
You're Jason data,

131
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,750
but that is a string itself.

132
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,540
But suppose for seeing purpose,

133
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,530
how you're getting that data as a dictionary.

134
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,570
But that is not a dictionary.

135
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,050
How you can process that we can't process that right.

136
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,750
So now what I'm doing is I'm going to convert this into your python data.

137
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,250
So for that,

138
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,260
what a harder do is simply You want data,

139
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,510
Dad?

140
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,810
Ligon,

141
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,250
print it.

142
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,510
Print used.

143
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,220
Jason dot lobe.

144
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,470
You have to lure from your Jason simply if you pass evil content,

145
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,380
they were file object to your Jason object cadets and model Justin will convert your data

146
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,250
into python.

147
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,790
Understandable data that is simply dictionary format.

148
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,650
Now see the result.

149
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,310
Now,

150
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,440
from this data I can take simply get because that is a dictionary date.

151
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,790
I can do some operation called Don't get No.

152
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,550
See the result.

153
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,610
Yes,

154
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,840
You're getting something like that.

155
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,220
Now,

156
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,550
I can do one more operation because these also dick story.

157
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,810
But previously with your four dot reid,

158
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,680
you are not getting your data as a dictionary.

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,220
You're getting something like a string.

160
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,270
So under thing,

161
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,350
you cannot perform your dictionary operations like key value operations.

162
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,190
That's why we are converting the Jason data in terms off dictionary.

163
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,880
For that,

164
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,650
we have a simple syntax called Justin Dark Lord,

165
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,670
your file object.

166
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,480
That's a very simple right.

167
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,790
See if you want to print what Jason data as it is,

168
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,360
right.

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,450
You can also do this one,

170
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,650
but don't exclude those 16 70 lines at a time.

171
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,960
You are a good anyone off that because once if you read the content,

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,150
you run out Anything to read again in that night?

173
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,100
Okay?

174
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,410
fine.

175
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,280
No,

176
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,850
these simple.

177
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,880
We're just to really What?

178
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,490
Data?

179
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:37,710
No.

180
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,260
What I want to do is in case in my hand,

181
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,220
If I have some data,

182
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,550
how can I store their data?

183
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,110
I'll do a Jason file.

184
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,760
So before going to store into your destined file inner toe,

185
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,950
think about what type of data you have in your hand.

186
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,070
You know,

187
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,800
while greeting the data from your dear son,

188
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,150
what is a former you're getting,

189
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,570
Dexter reformer.

190
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,020
That's why we're nobody.

191
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,750
If you want to store your data in Bria Dictionary for India,

192
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,120
Jason,

193
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,580
file,

194
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,010
you should have in your hand data as a dictionary.

195
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,280
All right.

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,810
See,

197
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,710
let me do one thing.

198
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,170
I'm going to create a my dick,

199
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,300
study someone I'm going to.

200
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,950
Great dictionary like name.

201
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,810
I'm writing us,

202
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,550
Narendra.

203
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:27,210
Then I'm writing skills Python,

204
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,120
shell family.

205
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,550
Here's Lewis.

206
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,150
Something like that.

207
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,900
Right now,

208
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,150
you know,

209
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,480
how do you have a dick study data?

210
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,590
This dictionary data you can able to write in the or Jason if you know that syntax.

211
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,650
So now let me try for syntax.

212
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:54,340
So first awful decision that you're going to create a Jason filed Justin file,

213
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:01,010
Let me take required file as Suppose my in four tortillas.

214
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,470
We sunny dear son.

215
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:09,450
So this is the Jason file I want to create with the help off our python.

216
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,270
So what?

217
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,650
I want berating Jason file.

218
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,060
I need to write this data.

219
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,110
What is your data?

220
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,610
It should be a dictionary.

221
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,990
Right,

222
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,550
then.

223
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,910
Fine.

224
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,320
Let me weapon.

225
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,330
First your file in,

226
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,110
right more.

227
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,360
But it is Jason or CSP or text file.

228
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,920
First step,

229
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,450
you have to go.

230
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,350
You have to open it,

231
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,170
you know,

232
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,070
require more.

233
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,270
I want to write the content.

234
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,990
Do you're filed,

235
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,820
and I need to open it in,

236
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,590
right More than finally just to close it between days.

237
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:35,880
Unity.

238
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,120
Right.

239
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,890
There were data into your dear son.

240
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,110
Right?

241
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,150
How we can write our daytime do Jason,

242
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,950
right?

243
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,480
Fine.

244
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,920
See that?

245
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,650
What I'm doing?

246
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:58,690
Simply dear son dot Dump Just We're pushing our data into Jason.

247
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,050
File Jason dot Dumb.

248
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,450
You want big study data?

249
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,180
We transfer to your file opsec.

250
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,830
That's it.

251
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,300
No.

252
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,260
Let me run it and see the airport.

253
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,700
So you just to push with your data into a Jason?

254
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,000
Fine.

255
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,100
Now we don't have any.

256
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,850
I'll put a year,

257
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,870
but we just created a file again If you want to see the data.

258
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,150
What is there in your Dexter Unity?

259
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,430
Really?

260
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,580
That you need to read that Justin file.

261
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,780
So just know we created a Justin file called My My in Food or Jason,

262
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,950
let me weapon that fight.

263
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,430
My,

264
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,790
my,

265
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,450
my yah,

266
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,860
my inform ideas.

267
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,650
And what is that?

268
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,450
I think my in four idea.

269
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:46,150
See that you're getting again a dictionary in a single line,

270
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,920
As off now,

271
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,590
ofcourse,

272
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,550
this is in a file.

273
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:55,450
Now you have to say that this is a day sun data are simply object in your Jason.

274
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,560
But whenever If you see here,

275
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:58,970
right,

276
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,320
Jason day darkened to stop some spaces.

277
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,360
Some indentations.

278
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,650
Right?

279
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,470
But that type of inundations you're not getting here while creating you're just on file.

280
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,190
It's simple.

281
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,110
You can create it.

282
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,440
Nothing is there.

283
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,950
While writing your content into your Jason file,

284
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,730
you need to mention what is your end then.

285
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,620
So I want to take four spaces.

286
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,120
Yes,

287
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,500
I need on weapon your file.

288
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,860
Justin,

289
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,790
file once again.

290
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,570
Now you will get indentations clearly anyone?

291
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,910
Yes.

292
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,370
And file.

293
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,150
See that now you're getting clearly right.

294
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:44,800
That's a So there's there's a simple way to really content from your Jason on to write

295
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,920
Contending DOJ is,

296
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,150
um,

297
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:53,060
the only thing you have to remember is reading is nothing but lording content from your

298
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,550
Jason.

299
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,980
Writing is nothing.

300
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,280
But whatever the content to you,

301
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:02,380
how that we are writing into your Jason are pushing into your Justin are dumping into your

302
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,650
gears and file Finally,

303
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,020
whenever.

304
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,370
If you're reading the content from your Jason,

305
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,150
you're getting your or put other dictionary with the help off.

306
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,050
You were just and got loads.

307
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,050
Yes and not Lord.

308
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,800
And whenever.

309
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,460
If you're trying to dump your data in courageous and file,

310
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,950
your data should be again a dictionary.

311
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,000
That's it like fine.

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,740
See here.

313
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,430
Finally,

314
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,290
we house smaller like them here in terms off,

315
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,980
fight on.

316
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,570
If it is a dictionary in terms off Jason,

317
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,750
it is an object.

318
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,450
So whatever the fight on Liston troubles are there they're simply Jason array,

319
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,310
stringing string only in digital float and whatever it may be.

320
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,350
Complex their numbers in your Jason,

321
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,900
so prove false.

322
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,150
See that true and false with small letters?

323
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,190
None?

324
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,620
No.

325
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,820
So if you remember this while working with your real time,

326
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,050
you know those who are going to work with you.

327
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,290
Our AWS site.

328
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,650
They're going to create so many times policies.

329
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,650
So policies are in terms off.

330
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,900
Just inform it.

331
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,150
Right,

332
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,450
so there it will be very helpful.

333
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,370
Okay,

334
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,760
so just remember this so that you can easily understand how we can convert our data into

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,900
Jason or from Jason to fight on.

336
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,100
Right?

337
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,470
The main thing you need to remember this you're just signed.

338
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,460
Took your Jason Day.

339
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,150
Trying to python is always a dictionary.

340
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,460
If you want to write your content into your Jason first thing,

341
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,140
you should write your data in Piketon as a dictionary.

342
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,220
That data way to dump into Jason.

343
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,050
Then that will become an object.

344
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,290
That's a simple like.

345
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,440
Okay,

346
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,750
guys,

347
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,170
thank you for watching this video.
