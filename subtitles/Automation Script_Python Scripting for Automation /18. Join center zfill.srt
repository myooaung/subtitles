1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150
prince here we're going to discuss three important or string operations.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,630
There are,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,880
like,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,250
enjoying center on Jiro feel right?

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,650
So how they're going to work?

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,620
Let me show you that by taking my potential.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,270
Of course,

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,360
you can also write in the world by transcript,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,620
But I'm things simply bite on common line.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,250
Let's say I have a string called by tone Hi.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,090
See my requirement?

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,480
Ease from this the X.

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,860
I mean from this fight on world,

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,050
I want to creative by tone word by placing between each two letters to characters.

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,890
It's space.

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,560
I mean,

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,650
I want to clear the way data such that it has to be in this way.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:53,720
But I want to create that from your ex itself.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:03,320
Simply why you cause to quotations on inside that just hyphen dot Join many what it's so

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,950
just to join space inside off your ex between your characters.

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,580
Simply print way right,

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,310
otherwise directly can print.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,540
See,

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:17,900
as of now,

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,190
I am printing X in this way.

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,050
No bring.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:28,900
You can also do something like suppose I'm adding starts between who characters in my given

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,150
x sido put or I want to bring the one by one letter,

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,490
then our slash and you know,

30
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,570
slash and means new line.

31
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,520
See that you're getting those stringing multiple lines in each leg.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,420
One character,

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,850
because leiston purposes.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,700
Otherwise,

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,250
let me add slash d c output.

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,350
You're writing tab between two characters off your given string.

37
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,850
Right?

38
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,650
So that is the importance off your joints Train.

39
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,400
Right.

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,250
Fine,

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,210
then the next one is center.

42
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,520
See,

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,780
guys,

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,720
sometimes you have some multiple strings on.

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,040
Do you want to bring all strings in the center?

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,630
Off your 10.

47
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,380
Miller in the center off some weight off your tunnel.

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:27,500
Let's say I have in my string call simply fight on And how one more new string called by

49
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:37,600
Don scripting and let me take some third string My string three equals two string

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,460
operations.

51
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,150
Okay,

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,530
now see there I'm going Toe print.

53
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,260
First of all,

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:55,010
let me take only my string not center So all strings So I want to bring the with the veto

55
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,180
supports some 20 characters now,

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,560
First of all,

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,110
let me print my first district So in quantity spaces you're string is there in the middle

58
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,550
of that.

59
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:11,430
Likewise I want to bring it that we use format all these things at a time.

60
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,750
I want I'm going to print.

61
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,050
Right?

62
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:30,280
So in the next line I want to print you are my new the stream dot center 20.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,250
See the output ability can understand What is the purpose of this center?

64
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,270
Then?

65
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:50,310
I want to bring you are ah next available called my string three Not center 20 and see the

66
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,100
output Something missing.

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,480
Let me see that.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,770
Yeah,

69
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,960
Quotations is missing.

70
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,240
Right?

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,280
See the output Woman C and P.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,520
Uh,

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,920
yes.

74
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,450
Summer spelling mistake.

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,350
See?

76
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,540
Nothing is there.

77
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,050
Guess what?

78
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,090
Our The lengthy or giving force.

79
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,620
Your python will take that much.

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,420
Lend in that length.

81
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,550
It will try to bring the war string from middle Yours left and right.

82
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,150
That's it.

83
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,180
Okay,

84
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,230
now,

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,640
Dreadful Jiro,

86
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,250
I'd Jiro Phil,

87
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,710
let me do one more thing.

88
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,080
Ah,

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,850
like,

90
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,200
uh,

91
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,990
bring let me take simply You will string.

92
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,660
I am printing.

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,570
You're getting something?

94
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,950
No,

95
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,390
but I want to print this a string.

96
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,150
Okay.

97
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,670
With something spaces on.

98
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,340
Anyway.

99
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,790
Your python string consist off only six characters.

100
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,850
The remaining forced places I want to part with the geo towards left.

101
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,850
See that total spaces are 10.

102
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,230
Right?

103
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,750
So you were given single undies.

104
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,140
Six remaining fourth places towards left.

105
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,670
I want to part with the judo.

106
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,950
So parting this our presence is call actually parting.

107
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,390
Right.

108
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,080
This operation is called actually the party.

109
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,370
Okay,

110
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,670
so there's these are the operations.

111
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,050
Ah,

112
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,150
uses off your joint center and jet feeling.

113
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,870
Hi.

114
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,910
Okay.

115

Thank you for watching this video.
