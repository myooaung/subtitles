00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
friends here.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.600
We're going to write one simple pipe transcript that is really part on check if given part

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.650
is a file or directory.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.130
So you had to write one by transcript says that it has to read some part after providing

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.750
part.

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.460
Right.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.080
You're fightin has toe value late that whether the given parties for five or is for

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.550
directory,

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.850
right,

10
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.650
Fine.

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.780
Let me weapon my able first so that as we know,

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.590
if you want to read a part what is always a string you need to remember that part is always

13
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.900
history.

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.160
If you go with any operating system parties always history First,

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.090
let me sail.

16
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.870
Programas identify given part are working on pot That would take something like part files

17
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.810
directly Not the way plane See,

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.410
My intention is I want to really apart first.

19
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.050
So parties always a strain.

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.650
That's why you know,

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.850
in your fight on you have a input syntax to read any string?

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.970
No,

23
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.060
I'm taking variable as part and I'm asking the user and Terry were park right?

24
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.010
So after that,

25
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.290
What?

26
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.850
How to do?

27
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.360
What about the part you are providing that?

28
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.480
But how to check with Eliza file or directory pond.

29
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.400
Then how can I will get there?

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.350
He previously we discussed for somewhere you were ways dot part sub model off your ways.

31
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.280
Where's that part?

32
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.490
Dot is file.

33
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.300
Is there a tree?

34
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.650
You can go with anyone off that.

35
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:52.170
So now I want to use waste model that I first unity import your ways Then whatever the part

36
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.980
you are providing,

37
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.310
I'm checking with this condition.

38
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.540
If ways that part dot is filed,

39
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.380
that means if given parties a filing,

40
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.750
then this will become true.

41
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.260
If it is true,

42
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.090
then whatever the logic you're going to write under they were if condition that will

43
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:20.010
exclude No what I want to display but given But whatever the pot is dead Saudi,

44
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.450
is it fight?

45
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.050
That's it.

46
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.110
So in case if given part given part is not a file,

47
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.550
then this condition will become false.

48
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.330
That means that is not a file.

49
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.060
If that is not their file them.

50
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.120
What is our option?

51
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.940
Definitely.

52
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.440
Desert dotted.

53
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.750
Right.

54
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.980
Then let me do it else block.

55
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.050
I'm writing print that given part.

56
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.650
Whatever the part you are providing that is he's a directory part.

57
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650
That's a likeness.

58
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.150
Save it.

59
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.420
Now I want to run this.

60
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.150
So let me open my command line.

61
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.280
So already I'm in the location Where you how you are.

62
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.500
Script This one.

63
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.660
Let me run it with your pipes on three I am working with by down three only guys study Be

64
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.530
widely hatchway in Haifa.

65
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.150
My fun.

66
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.830
But we don't simply this thing.

67
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.250
Yeah,

68
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.040
No,

69
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.190
Let me run your script.

70
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.880
That is part file directly.

71
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.450
Not the way.

72
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.590
Yes,

73
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.720
it is asking something.

74
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.200
So,

75
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.450
guys,

76
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.860
we are working on windows,

77
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.450
right?

78
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.740
See,

79
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.340
whenever you help,

80
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.850
If you're looking with windows,

81
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.850
you always you have to always provide.

82
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.400
You are part us.

83
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.920
I mean,

84
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.000
we'll bring your path.

85
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.980
You have to provide two slashes in your part instead of one slash You know what is the

86
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.150
reason we already discussed that in previous sessions?

87
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.660
No.

88
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.450
Let me enter it and see the output.

89
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.450
The given pot.

90
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.060
He's indirectly.

91
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.500
Yes,

92
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.450
you're getting the thing.

93
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.140
No,

94
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.130
let me read on and I'm providing same thing.

95
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.270
But at the end I'm giving our fight on script name itself.

96
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.770
No problem.

97
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.950
We can probably anything not see The result body are getting is a file,

98
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.350
right?

99
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.250
No.

100
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:19.490
Let me read on and I'm giving something called some ex colon fight on.

101
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.120
So this part I'm giving.

102
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.350
But I will put your getting either directly.

103
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.830
But if you observe,

104
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.550
this party is not there in my host.

105
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.350
If you go with my system,

106
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.720
see that I have only see and you have Jeanneret priests.

107
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.880
I don't have this directory.

108
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.100
No x X,

109
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.610
right?

110
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.100
Why don't how?

111
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.050
But still you're getting information as is Apparently it's absolutely wrong why you are

112
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.830
getting this situation means you are taking if given thing is a file,

113
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.950
then you are excluding this.

114
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.830
So whether dizzy directory are if it is invalid,

115
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.560
then at that time by default,

116
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.650
this result would become false at the time you're excluding else.

117
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.010
That's why what I always before checking whether that is a file or Barrett three Foster,

118
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.650
follow your to check whether that given parties existing on mark,

119
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.310
Right?

120
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.570
See,

121
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:21.140
that's why what I'm doing is let me ability or entire cold know What I'm doing is if ways

122
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.860
dark part not exist if given but is existing then only I want to identify whether that is a

123
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.510
file or not.

124
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.450
If it is not like this thing,

125
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.550
I don't want to do it night.

126
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.450
Fine.

127
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.900
Like I'm saying,

128
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.520
simply given parties are valid if it is a value that I'm like an identifying.

129
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.560
But it is a file or not.

130
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.200
Ehlz,

131
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.150
bring given.

132
00:05:52.150 --> 00:06:05.810
But if you want to read that part ignited type is not existing on this host not given part

133
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.810
.

134
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.100
Whatever the part you are giving,

135
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.620
luckily right,

136
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.030
that part is a valid one.

137
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.040
Fasting is a valued part.

138
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.140
But let me on this.

139
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.250
Then we will are your core Mark.

140
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.820
Let me go to come online.

141
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.800
Let me run it.

142
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.290
I'm running and I'm probably before running.

143
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.150
Let me do this thing.

144
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.570
This is your core.

145
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.750
Now I'm running and I'm going to provide some random thing.

146
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.650
See,

147
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.030
X is not existing on this host.

148
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.320
Actually,

149
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.430
that is not a valid part.

150
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.950
That's where you're getting that is not existing on this part.

151
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.710
No,

152
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.720
let me a villain and probably some value Pot said this is a valued part,

153
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.970
right?

154
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.360
But it is a file or not secondary.

155
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.790
First of all,

156
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.050
I'm checking whether that is existing on your host or not.

157
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.960
That's what you're doing here.

158
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.550
Where's their part that exists?

159
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.930
See that given part is valid part.

160
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.740
Even if you provide that tree also,

161
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.550
it will work.

162
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.860
See up to this This is inherently part,

163
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.150
right?

164
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:13.780
It's working so after verifying that is a valid apart Right after that you have to check

165
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.060
whether that is a directory or not.

166
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.770
That's why inside off your if condition you had right One motive condition that is,

167
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:27.300
if where is that Bobdart is filed then then I can buy it.

168
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:40.050
Bring given far Whatever the parties there simply I will write on it is a on it easy fight

169
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.050
.

170
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.550
But girls Els,

171
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.640
first of all after existence,

172
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.830
see off your part You are entering into this block inside off that you're if condition one

173
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.150
second We're very thing where there is a file or not with your ways that partner is filed

174
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.620
He's filed.

175
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.040
This will become true than your printing on it is a file part.

176
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.830
If it is not,

177
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.410
then what you're displaying on it?

178
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.200
Is it barrack three.

179
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.750
But that's it,

180
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.560
right?

181
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.550
See that?

182
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.450
I'm going to run and I'm going to provide.

183
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:24.210
See that value part on it is about three like then Dylan and provide some fight,

184
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.650
but yes,

185
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.170
first of all it is a valued part.

186
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.450
On it is a file part,

187
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.050
not right.

188
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.780
So there's this is the way simply how you can verify given part,

189
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.850
thes a file park or that every part.

190
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:44.290
So make sure that before violating your party's a file or directory part masterful,

191
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.120
you should check it.

192
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.050
You should verify it,

193
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.250
whether given parties existing on your host are not.

194
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.000
If it is not existing,

195
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.700
then you can't identify.

196
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.050
That is a file or directory I find.

197
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.050
So this is the way how you can work with the world.

198
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.390
Fight on to identify your your parts.

199
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:05.690
I mean,

200
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.950
like,

201
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.920
file or directory like Okay,

202
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.150
okay,

203
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.420

204
