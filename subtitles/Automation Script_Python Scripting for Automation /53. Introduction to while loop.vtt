00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
friends.

2
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.480
We know that loops are useful to repeat or it rate illogic.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.840
Not really.

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.050
We have seen for you.

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.390
Now we have one more loop with your bite on that is called while you let me explain,

6
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.510
award your value by taking simple example.

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.650
First of all,

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.550
I'm taking simply brain.

9
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.680
Welcome to loops.

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.310
Suppose I want to print This measure is only one time then I can directly right to print

11
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.450
Welcome to loops.

12
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.150
But I want to print this Mrs 10 times than what I can do.

13
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.150
One thing is I can write this a statement 10 times sprint.

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.050
Welcome to loops.

15
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.300
Welcome to loops like Weighs 10 times I can buy.

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.880
But already we know for Lou.

17
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.700
That's why what I'm doing is I'm going to Great.

18
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.430
I'm going to rate this logic for 10 times for teaching range off,

19
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.940
then not only range often that looking probably a string which consist off 10 characters

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.920
that's there once.

21
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.060
If you run your cold,

22
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.150
it is going to repeat you are It is goingto bring the or Mrs 10 times.

23
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:17.010
But I want to print this mrs include the number of times I want to repeat this message for

24
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.410
anything,

25
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.450
any number of times.

26
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.050
Let me modify this for Luke with while true?

27
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.000
No,

28
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.750
see the result.

29
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.060
So get more clarity.

30
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.250
I'm writing one more line here so that I can understand that is going to repeat it in the

31
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.150
number of times or not See that it is going to repeat for infinite number off times,

32
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.650
right?

33
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.450
So sometimes you may need to repeat your logic for in V number of times.

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.110
Let me you very simple example.

35
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.140
First,

36
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.950
let me stop it.

37
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.180
So if you write false,

38
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.750
then it will stop.

39
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.980
That's fine.

40
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.920
So first of all,

41
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.560
you have to understand that if you want to repeat a logic for any number of times,

42
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.150
then he hard to go with white blue.

43
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.050
Right?

44
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.540
So that's how it is going to work.

45
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.860
Yeah,

46
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.040
let me explain that as well.

47
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.760
So if anybody feel,

48
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.580
run your script with this way,

49
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.950
Lou,

50
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.250
because off while right while is a loop first off,

51
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.650
all this logic will repeat,

52
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.910
but on the number of times.

53
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.370
If you write directly true here that it is going to repeat for any number of times.

54
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.270
Same logic will re eggs good for infinite number off times.

55
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.540
If you try to prove how it is doing means whenever there is a while,

56
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.700
your partner will check first the value here it is a true right.

57
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.680
If it is true,

58
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.850
do legs good ones.

59
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.230
Then again,

60
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.950
your pattern will come back to this position on again.

61
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.310
We'll check anyway,

62
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.820
this year fixed while you're proof that again doing execute again your pattern will come

63
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.430
back to here again.

64
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.290
Is it true you will exclude like ways?

65
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.620
It is true for Lifetime.

66
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.350
So it is going to repeat for infinite number off times.

67
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.950
That's why this is a invented Lou like.

68
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.150
That's fine.

69
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.350
No.

70
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.150
What is the use off?

71
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.510
Innovative.

72
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.710
Look,

73
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.700
let us assume that you need to wander a fight system for lifetime.

74
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.590
Then what?

75
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.920
I will do simply true here.

76
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.500
I've already logic to monitor your file system as off.

77
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.820
No,

78
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.250
simply I'm writing.

79
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.940
Bring Stedman morning file system,

80
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.950
you sage,

81
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.630
just for our clarity.

82
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.710
I'm writing one more line.

83
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.650
Don't see that for every one minute.

84
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.460
I need to monitor my file system uses but for lifetime than what I will do.

85
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.780
Just I'm importing time or do,

86
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.490
uh then after every one minute right but injured off one minute.

87
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.620
What I will lose as off.

88
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.880
No,

89
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.550
I'm taking simply sec one second,

90
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.130
not for everyone.

91
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.990
So I can now our script will monetary or find system usage in get celebrities are reaching

92
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.690
special value.

93
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.260
Then you can send mail.

94
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.750
Allard's.

95
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.410
I don't see that once.

96
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.320
If you run your script and if we leave it,

97
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.750
it is going to monitor your file system for lifetime not to.

98
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.250
So that is one of the uses when you want to repeat your logic for infinite number off times

99
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.550
like that's fine.

100
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.230
Most something's You don't know how many number of times you need to be pretty or logic,

101
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.850
but after something number off times you need to stop means just I June Dart.

102
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.250
Ah,

103
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.240
I want to print and number the next time I want to print a your number by adding some

104
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.050
random number.

105
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.370
I mean,

106
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.580
first,

107
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.210
let me rate logic so that you can understand.

108
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.250
Let me take initially a value.

109
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.580
Let's say some number four,

110
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.110
then I'm taking while proof.

111
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.050
Then I'm printing your value initial value.

112
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.540
Then what is the next to well,

113
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.500
you want to print?

114
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.790
I'm taking next to value,

115
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.010
plus some random number.

116
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.200
I'm marrying now.

117
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.700
If I run,

118
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.350
they see that it is going to get some numbers.

119
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.250
Right?

120
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.300
Let me stop it.

121
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.350
So in this way you feel run.

122
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.720
You're going to get your numbers.

123
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.930
Any free number of times.

124
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.390
I mean,

125
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.960
uh,

126
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.710
in Vietnamese.

127
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.120
You're going to get initially for then?

128
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.450
Ah,

129
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.250
for 60 then for something on 900 something like that you're going to get,

130
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.650
But I want to I don't want to get all the numbers.

131
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.250
I want to get the numbers.

132
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.750
Only suppose,

133
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.250
uh,

134
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.160
let me write.

135
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.750
If your value is less than articles to some,

136
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.850
this number.

137
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.170
So here what I'm reading.

138
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.470
I'm reading a condition such that previously here you have it,

139
00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.950
right?

140
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.090
No.

141
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.240
Let me write to proof us.

142
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.180
You're going to get some numbers,

143
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.810
but I don't want to get all these numbers.

144
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.650
I want to stop this loop once if I reach my value more than this.

145
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.600
Now,

146
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.770
see,

147
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:25.550
that is a in case if your value is greater than 6789 then you're going to stop it.

148
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.410
Actually,

149
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.360
I'm repeating this for every number of times,

150
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.650
but I don't want repeating for a number of times.

151
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.450
I want to get the numbers which are less than this.

152
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:43.200
So intentionally you can stop your wild Liu based on condition as well.

153
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.410
Right?

154
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.050
Initially,

155
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.870
this is a value.

156
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.020
I'm printing that value for my value.

157
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.160
Um,

158
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.010
adding something and I'm them printing right not to get more clarity.

159
00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:04.400
Let me take simply while grew simply print Hello?

160
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.650
No,

161
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.350
it is going to repeat in the number of times.

162
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.350
But I don't want toe print in the number of times,

163
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.920
right?

164
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.540
I want to bring only four.

165
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.750
Suppose four times.

166
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.950
Let me take initially called because to Jiro?

167
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.360
No What I'm reading is here I am writing condo value.

168
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.150
If it is less them r equals less than fight.

169
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:38.750
I can't take it may be less than because to fight Let me take in Chile counties one I know

170
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.350
what I'm doing is I'm increasing contra value as well.

171
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:47.200
Don't see that you're going to get your output only for fight times.

172
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.500
You're going to repeat this logic only for five times.

173
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.550
Then how it is working,

174
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.830
I think.

175
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.740
Is that simply first your initializing some conditions Sodom Sorry.

176
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:02.090
Some variable insulating County Costa one So while e faster fall while means you have to

177
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.730
assume that the lines which are there on the river why look will repeat for infinite number

178
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.350
of times,

179
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.390
right?

180
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.640
So how it is going to work?

181
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.230
We know that while first fighting will check this condition resulted Counties initially one

182
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.470
right one less Darcos to fight means true If it is true,

183
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.700
your vital exclude these two lines ones.

184
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.930
So because off these you are also increasing your counter value until it is won.

185
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.430
Now,

186
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.010
after excluding first time for forced integration,

187
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.320
your counter value is becoming one plus 12 Now,

188
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.920
with this to now Conte's two,

189
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.850
not one you are fighting is coming to this position.

190
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.420
I'll be checking this condition to less than articles to find.

191
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:44.650
Yes,

192
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:44.970
true.

193
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.040
Then I gained two legs.

194
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.770
Could this logic.

195
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:52.650
But while excluding this logic now you're making your condo value from Kyoto to place 13

196
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.530
Then we do this three or fighting will come to here and three less done because to fight?

197
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.780
Yes,

198
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.070
true.

199
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.370
Then it will exclude one second.

200
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.490
Now you're calling two becomes 43 plus 14 Then again,

201
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.300
your pattern will come toe here with it.

202
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:06.600
Count.

203
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.950
Because 244 left.

204
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.130
Articles to fight through.

205
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.390
Then who likes good once again,

206
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.250
this loss No con value.

207
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.270
Fight with this fire again.

208
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.010
Your pattern will come to this position.

209
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.330
Filers Don Rickles to fight through Romans again.

210
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.160
This logical eggs,

211
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.850
good ones.

212
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.320
But now five plus 16 six less than articles to fight.

213
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.190
No false.

214
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.010
If it is false,

215
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.290
now you're biting is going to stop your while you That's it.

216
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.390
Right.

217
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.030
So here we are,

218
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.250
fixing how many times you want to repeat,

219
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.450
right?

220
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.350
Not only that.

221
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:48.050
So based on other condition he while adding some number for your initial value,

222
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.390
you're going to get your value more than this afters after a number of times.

223
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.060
You don't know how many times you want to repeat.

224
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.350
But you know the condition.

225
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.370
Once our value is more than this,

226
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.390
then I want to stop it.

227
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.560
So here,

228
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.280
just be clear.

229
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.690
We don't know how many times you're going after the Harmony Times.

230
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.840
You're going to get this number.

231
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.310
You don't know.

232
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.050
But you know that Certainly.

233
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.740
Definitely.

234
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.660
After a certain number of times,

235
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.430
your number will be more than this.

236
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.020
Are this at that situation.

237
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.900
You want to stop it,

238
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.530
right?

239
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.700
So why loop in?

240
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.380
Python is used to repeat or trade over a block off court as long as the test expression or

241
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.300
condition is true.

242
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.550
Right?

243
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.550
That's what we're doing here.

244
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.930
As long as the condition desert is true,

245
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.550
then it is going to exclude this line.

246
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.540
That is one case.

247
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.670
2nd 1 is we use this Luke,

248
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.240
then we don't want beforehand.

249
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.800
The number off time student.

250
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.350
That's what with this example,

251
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.810
Really?

252
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.420
We don't know home.

253
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:51.940
And after all,

254
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.280
many times you're going to get this.

255
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.750
I mean,

256
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.350
after how many traditions you're going to get your number more than this,

257
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.980
we don't know.

258
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.940
But we know that because of this calculation,

259
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.110
somewhere somewhere you would reach your number more than this At that time,

260
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.950
I want to stop it.

261
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.970
So that is the logic off by Lou.

262
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.610
Right?

263
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.860
So let's be clear.

264
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.400
One thing is to repeat your logic for any number of times.

265
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.810
Second thing is to repeat your logic until a condition is true.

266
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.350
And one more thing is that is the important one.

267
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.940
Before starting your logic,

268
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.550
you don't know how many times you want to get ready were lousy,

269
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.760
but based on some condition,

270
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.650
you can stop it.

271
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.750
So that condition you can use it in your while loop.

272
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.850
Okay,

273
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.470
But it is.

274
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.790
Thank you for watching this video.

275
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.710
We're going forward.

276
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.370
We will see.

277
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.120
Ah,

278
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.650
real time use case off your while loop with many examples,

279
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.750
okay?
