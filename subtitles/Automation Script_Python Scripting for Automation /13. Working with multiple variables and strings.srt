1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,070
friends in this video,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,450
we're going to see how to use multiple variables or strings with your prints.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,200
Statement on different ways to use your prints,

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,550
Shechtman.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,720
Not we explain this.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,680
Let me write the simple python script.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,330
So I'm going to open my sublime texts.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,450
Let me weapon their sublime text.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,850
And let me give you a name for this starscape like,

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,940
ah,

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,050
working with variables or multiple variables.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,070
So we have our working directory in the next application with by transcript there.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,350
I'm going to store my script,

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:50,190
like multiple variables in Bring You can take any program,

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,010
name or strip name.

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,150
I'm taking simply this one.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,250
Okay,

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,780
so there's I'm going to defend force or different variables.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,590
You know,

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,470
if you want to define any variable,

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:00:59,860
right,

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,450
you can take something like this,

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,290
and I'm going to take my name.

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,850
As for language name because of some fight on scripting,

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,630
like so this is the way how to define your multiple variables are,

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,150
you know,

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,390
interrupt this right.

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,840
There is one more way that is.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,450
You can also define your variables in a single line,

30
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,470
like extra close to three call.

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:30,930
And why?

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:40,820
Cause to find out seven Colon then language name equals two by Don Scripting Motor Valley.

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,400
So I,

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,950
Commander Yara this way of representing now you can run your program by defining in this

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,350
way or in this report are valid ones.

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,050
That's okay.

37
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,970
Know what I'm doing is I want to print all these variables like See that how I'm going to

38
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,300
bring.

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,150
So if you want to print one single variable,

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,810
right?

41
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,590
Let me say this.

42
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,410
I'm done it first.

43
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,250
I'm printing the value off yet or variable X value on.

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,160
We're getting that three and I want to print all these variables.

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,970
I can buy it X,

46
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,490
come awake.

47
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,250
A mustard with single parents treatment.

48
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,850
Sorry,

49
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,890
we don't have observed right.

50
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,950
We hope this one Let me run this and see the output.

51
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,980
Yes,

52
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,350
You're getting all your variables,

53
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,250
right?

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,650
So this is one way.

55
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,550
2nd 1 is start with conditions.

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,800
You want to print three variables?

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,660
Just take three curly braces undocked on.

58
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,490
Close your conditions with the quotations.

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,310
Are you were curly braces with conditions,

60
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,490
then door four months.

61
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,600
Whatever the order,

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,630
you want to print your variables?

63
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,120
I mean,

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,500
first I want to print in this curly braces Xolo.

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,030
That's why here,

66
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,000
out to give first X,

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
then white them your language name.

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,530
So in Costa first toe calibrates you will get your X value here and here you will get.

69
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,110
Why value on in the last calibers?

70
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,750
You are getting this very but right.

71
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,210
No,

72
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,730
Let me your previous Lenny's Let me keep this line.

73
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,980
Osiris Rex,

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,560
Come away!

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,080
Come on.

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Lange's name and I'm going to come in.

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,180
This line can see the output.

78
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,350
You're a good signal.

79
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,830
No,

80
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,550
I want to get this in one line on this fight out 71 line by Tom Skipping in one more line.

81
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,970
See,

82
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,990
Between this,

83
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,310
I'm including slash in.

84
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,730
You know,

85
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,350
slashing is a special character.

86
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,720
A New York include,

87
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,650
always slash.

88
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,500
And in the quotations only already your calibration started in the conditions.

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,750
Only right now I'm taking slash And then he had also I'm taking slash in now See the output

90
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:52,750
.

91
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,790
You're getting your variable values in different lanes because off slash and whatever the

92
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,550
value your printing in this curly brace that is going to next line,

93
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,450
right?

94
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,850
So foster thing.

95
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,160
12 three,

96
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,450
then because I want to print a three variable values on providing order first I want to

97
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,950
bring the X value than way value,

98
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,400
then language name.

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,260
If you want to change,

100
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,600
you can change the order also.

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,750
Right?

102
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,130
No,

103
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:39,980
let me change order and print that spring One do three then not for my first.

104
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,710
I'm going to bring the Y value the next.

105
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,950
Then language name.

106
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,150
See the output?

107
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,450
Yes,

108
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,800
on guys in fightin three directs.

109
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,440
You have a one more special print Straight man on that is no spring simply yes.

110
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,450
Quotations,

111
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,650
Quotations.

112
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,550
Okay,

113
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,400
close.

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,830
So actually,

115
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,040
whatever you are printing between quotations,

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,370
you know,

117
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:14,660
let me write for this one values or something I didn t print as it is in output line.

118
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,450
Right?

119
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,430
And even though if you're variable is the X.

120
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,360
If I write x,

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:29,250
it won't display X value will display as dizzy X But I want to print x value then format

122
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,540
format you conveniently right in your car.

123
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,950
Liberace itself You are y value.

124
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:43,110
So they're in the butler calibrates you are value will be printed The variable value sit

125
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,550
output.

126
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:51,010
Now I want to print like the X value ease then x well waiver Levi's then Waverly,

127
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,340
right?

128
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,120
See X value is so this will be considered as a string.

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,080
But if read anything inside of curly braces that will be considered as a variable on in

130
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,500
place off,

131
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,480
that variable value will be displayed.

132
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,530
Right?

133
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,040
Sammy,

134
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,760
I need the white value.

135
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:18,800
Is somebody need the language is now Let me say we don't want it,

136
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,620
but I want to bring X value is yet I mean,

137
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,220
what about a valley?

138
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,360
We're getting in one line?

139
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,230
The waiver.

140
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,490
Levi's second line on this in next line.

141
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,620
Then just right before you are lying,

142
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,790
slash in and see the output where you're getting your output for each and everything.

143
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,650
That's it,

144
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,430
right?

145
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,550
So there's tried to use this 11 to print a straight man.

146
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,580
Okay.

147
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,490
And one more thing.

148
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,170
Whatever you how in your printed statement with quotations,

149
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,040
the same thing you can also assigned to some variable.

150
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,350
Also,

151
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,850
let me do that.

152
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,960
Let me take my required output.

153
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,050
I'm breaking in this way.

154
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,550
I mean,

155
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,480
whatever the information I want to print,

156
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
I can write in this way also.

157
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,080
And I'm starting that into my variable.

158
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,340
Now,

159
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,720
finally,

160
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,750
I can print my variable in this way.

161
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,250
This will also what's under the output.

162
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,340
Well,

163
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,570
for two,

164
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,090
it is working.

165
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,080
Right.

166
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,850
So be clear.

167
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,150
So that is my solution is okay,

168
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,380
Because we're learning.

169
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,290
Fight on three Rolex.

170
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,440
Try to use this one.

171
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,710
It is very simple one.

172
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,430
No need to get confused If you want to print any string dirty radio string if you want to

173
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,190
print any very were variable value,

174
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,660
right?

175
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,460
Your available income.

176
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,890
Liberace is the is the enhanced you want in your treat.

177
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,410
Our necks.

178
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,450
Okay,

179
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,050
right.

180
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,340
So this is the way how to work with multiple variables and multiple strings.

181
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,310
So these are variables,

182
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,510
you know,

183
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,330
the X way and language name on this directly string,

184
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,480
you're placing the society a string and finally remember that whatever you are printing

185
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,350
that result,
