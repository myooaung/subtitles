1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
prince here.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,150
We're discussing search and match operations off our remodel.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,050
See,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:14,140
in your body we have different operations and options and functions.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,110
Let me import Ari.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,070
And if you know,

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,460
we have a the air operation coolly start all the operations and functions right on

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,290
variables to list from your model.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,720
So these all our operations now among all those as off?

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,030
No,

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,750
I'm going to work with such under match,

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,550
right?

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,240
No.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,700
Let me go and start a body or such operation first Let me look in my anytime.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,820
So I'm going to save it as a such a match of practice.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,650
Not be way no See the result First time importing module called body.

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:04,350
Now I'm taking it Text like this is for fight on on There are cool major who are sense

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:24,250
Let's say fight on two on fight on three on just a junior in future Someone's bite on foot

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,580
Just just I'm writing for our practice purpose No Let me write a pattern such that I need

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,830
to find out only as off know the value Pythons by 10 40 is not evaluate us off.

21
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,090
No right!

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,120
See how I'm going to read a pattern,

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,150
So simply delight any variable called pattern with drawstring.

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,780
First of all,

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,700
you're looking for a world or any string.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,210
I'm looking for a word,

27
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,010
Let's say slash B starting on ending.

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,540
So between that support,

29
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,930
if I write,

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,280
simply bite on and already we know the find operations are defined.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,990
All operation.

32
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,550
Let me first practice with final your partner in a given text.

33
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,910
Now see the result.

34
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,450
What you're getting simply are getting Piper.

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:15,570
But I want to get fight on two and fight on three as well.

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,120
Then suppose you for right here.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Only two you're going to get fight onto.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,210
But now we are not getting fight on fight on three.

39
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,690
So let me right to our three and square records.

40
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,050
Mostly the result you're getting fight on to one pie country.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,970
But what about this?

42
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,480
Bite on?

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,630
So if you want to get despite on,

44
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,410
your numbers are optional Right then he already a question more.

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,940
So what is the meaning?

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,330
Off question?

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,650
More.

48
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,000
Whatever the number you're having that may or may not be present.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,010
That's why it is not that.

50
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,110
Then fight on that is going to match here.

51
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,650
Now See the result?

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,370
Yes.

53
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,430
You're getting suppose anywhere to 13 our numbers,

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,770
right?

55
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,450
Suppose if I go with slash D slash d means any number genital nine.

56
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,110
No.

57
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,550
See the result body or getting?

58
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,550
Do you know that?

59
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,880
The weighty hedge?

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,240
Sorry.

61
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,750
Yes.

62
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,120
Pile.

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,750
Mistake.

64
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,060
No real in your currency.

65
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,650
The results you're getting fight on four as well Because we are writing Simply slash days.

66
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,900
Last day means any number,

67
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,590
Gerardo nine.

68
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,330
But we hard to work with only 213 Either two or three.

69
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,550
That's why we're writing in square brackets to our strange enough writing slash b Be clear

70
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,550
.

71
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,350
That's fine.

72
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,140
No,

73
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,590
as off?

74
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,060
No,

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,950
because off your pattern you're going to match this many words from your given text.

76
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,820
But among all those if you observe what is the first to match even you were given text

77
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,450
fight on.

78
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,820
But suppose you feel your fight on two on the year If you fight on three now the first

79
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:59,480
occurring match in a given text despite onto right now my requirement is I don't want to

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,350
get all match ing's Whatever the partner I'm taking from the pattern whatever the first

81
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,150
match is there any given text that only I want to find.

82
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,310
Let's say fight on boot as after you have 1st 2 matches bite onto that only I want to find

83
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,310
.

84
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,950
Then you're such a brazen is helpful.

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:25,450
It looks through all the anti string on returns the first to match it will match only one

86
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:25,910
match.

87
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,730
It will visit.

88
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,700
It will return only one match.

89
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,420
Not all finally is going to find all But Matt Such is going to find only the foster match.

90
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,930
That means by turn cool!

91
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,050
It is going to find if I remove this bite on Do then what is the first to match by country

92
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,750
that already has simply fightem.

93
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,970
How about if I remove these first?

94
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:59,240
Let me go with you are such operation and see the results print Audie door such Then you

95
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,150
will pattern in a given text.

96
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,600
See the output?

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,790
You're getting some object.

98
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,690
Don't worry about that.

99
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,590
See the match?

100
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,550
What is the match you got?

101
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,450
Bite on Because among all those the first matches by turned toe Now if I read some very

102
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,480
year simply white on then that is the first to match.

103
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,990
These are forced occurring world Any given text from your patterns,

104
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,440
that is,

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,860
it is finding right.

106
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,150
It will look in the entire string only for first Too much.

107
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,350
Not for all matches.

108
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,900
That's important one.

109
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,770
And suppose if you don't have any match,

110
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,000
let's say I'm writing some random pattern.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,890
Yeah,

112
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,550
we are going to get none presided,

113
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,500
right?

114
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,350
Big clear.

115
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,330
No injured.

116
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,200
Directly printing my match.

117
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,660
I'm going to store it in tow.

118
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,660
Some variable called match object That is object because instead of that you have some

119
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,390
information.

120
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,690
What is that information?

121
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,450
I will show you.

122
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,620
Bring my job's eqt.

123
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:53,860
See?

124
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,380
That is it.

125
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:02,050
Span means starting in Nick's 11 minus phi is the length off your match?

126
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:11,480
11 minus one is the ending index for he was string for your match on this pattern is going

127
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,350
to represent multiple words.

128
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,280
But what is the matter?

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
What if you want to find your toe?

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,010
Look,

131
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,460
here are true logic.

132
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:28,380
If you want toe display only that I will show you that now See there now What I'm doing is

133
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,350
bringing much,

134
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:42,380
much from it given pattern from your pattern.

135
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,060
So what is the match exactly are getting you may get fight on to our fight on or pipe

136
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,230
country if the very first where despite under you're going to get right onto as after the

137
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,510
very first word is python from this value patterns,

138
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,250
That's where it is going to fetch Fight on,

139
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,750
then the his object Right from this,

140
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,650
I want to display only the Machu one.

141
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,450
Then you had to write something like You are much object.

142
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:17,010
They since you're operating your variable directly gonna decided are such pattern then dot

143
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:23,550
group But it is a better practice to take us into story or match object into some variable

144
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,950
Now see the result Buy it on.

145
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,100
If I remove these from here,

146
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,640
you'll see the result first,

147
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,610
matching his bite onto from your pattern.

148
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,840
You're getting that I don't want to bring to this match.

149
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:48,860
Object that Then what is the starting index off your Matute battle?

150
00:07:48,860 --> 00:08:01,140
So see that starting index He's from your matchup city or to use dot Start starting.

151
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,950
You can count the operation off p starting.

152
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:10,930
Then what is the ending index off this If it is 13 14 15 16 17 18 19.

153
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:21,150
Now see the result ending index match object dot and see the result first.

154
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,880
You're getting 20 but 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 is reeling in legs.

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,280
That's why this is minus one.

156
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,750
Hard to do.

157
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,330
No,

158
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,900
that's fine.

159
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,750
Then what is the length off your matching object?

160
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,670
Nothing.

161
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:49,490
Is there simply You are much object Dottie End than minus match object dot start is the

162
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,750
length that right?

163
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,200
And suppose if you don't have a match on,

164
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,820
if you perform these operations,

165
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,940
you're going to get another.

166
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,950
Let's say I'm writing something random values here and I'm running and I'm going to run

167
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,240
this court to see that if you print your match observed,

168
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,150
that is a nun actually see the result in the airport?

169
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,700
None you're getting.

170
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,910
But how If it is a nun,

171
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,740
how you can find a group,

172
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,890
I'm in matching things.

173
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,370
Starting thing ending it sort possible.

174
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,470
There is no match for your pattern than how you can find these operations.

175
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,050
That's why,

176
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,850
while walking with your patrons,

177
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,660
right that do,

178
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,110
especially with your such kind match.

179
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,150
Suppose as off no.

180
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:50,360
So what you have to do is before finding you have to check if match objectives present.

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,290
If it is none,

182
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,650
if collision becomes I mean the result is false,

183
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:53,790
then,

184
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,660
if doesn't allow to execute this operation's,

185
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,080
that's it.

186
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,800
Very simple.

187
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Only if there is a match that only you want to find the values.

188
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,680
Otherwise morninto find l sprint simply.

189
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,950
No match formed.

190
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,620
No,

191
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,380
let's say now.

192
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,070
Random pattern.

193
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,620
I'm looking.

194
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,310
Let's a pattern.

195
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,150
Is something this?

196
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,700
There's no way mortified my pattern right now that we're on this no match phone.

197
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,550
That's that is a way how you can handle with your regular expressions to find your match.

198
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,680
Starting index ending in legs.

199
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,240
Right.

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,900
Something like that,

201
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,250
Len.

202
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,090
So if condition is very helpful to work with your regular expressions,

203
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,450
fine.

204
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,460
No,

205
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,850
let me take our string as modeling.

206
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,140
This is for no second line.

207
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,850
I'm writing.

208
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,610
Okay?

209
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,530
You can take even multi lanes also.

210
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,250
No problem.

211
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,230
Now,

212
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,380
as after you have three lengths off text that is multilane.

213
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,150
Now see the result?

214
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,180
Is there any change?

215
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,750
No.

216
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,130
By the fall,

217
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,850
such we look in all the lines.

218
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,380
If you have a one late,

219
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,300
we look in the one line.

220
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,450
If you have all the lands were looking all the lines by the Ford subjects for multi line.

221
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,250
Okay.

222
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:14,960
Be clear.

223
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,650
No,

224
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,880
let me go with now.

225
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,930
You are next.

226
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,720
Operation is match,

227
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,040
right?

228
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,300
Let me come in this thing.

229
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:34,470
See?

230
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,820
As off.

231
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:34,970
No.

232
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:41,950
Suppose if you do this Ah find all we know how many Parton's you're going to match.

233
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:49,250
But if you have done your bite onto is there somewhere it is not there at the very first,

234
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,070
right?

235
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,950
No.

236
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,550
First let me run this.

237
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,650
Bring let me come in the score.

238
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,300
That's very simple about match.

239
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,820
Don't worry,

240
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,150
You can understand Sprint Orry Dort match.

241
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,200
You're part run in a next See the result.

242
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,700
You're getting none.

243
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,860
Actually,

244
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,150
the match Purpose ease.

245
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,180
Same as such.

246
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,680
But you look only at this starting index.

247
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,250
If it is their very first even life hell,

248
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,910
multi lines are one line they were much will look only at the starting.

249
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,560
Our generate index is very match among all those your patterns.

250
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,250
If there is anyone part,

251
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,260
I mean it is going to happen.

252
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,520
Three words right among all those three words.

253
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Is there any word?

254
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,850
Very first in the given line in the first line.

255
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,660
Then only your match will work.

256
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,690
Otherwise it won't look in.

257
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,890
The remaining lines are in the entire string.

258
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:52,510
It won't look only genital expression to look right.

259
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:52,730
See,

260
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,990
as I know this is your text.

261
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,950
And let me take these two things once again here.

262
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,290
Like,

263
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,450
I suppose if I try to bring people already don't match.

264
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,910
You're part from in a given text.

265
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,650
Even I want to look in the multilane.

266
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,470
What happened?

267
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay,

268
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,800
one more parentis is none seeing that second Lenny,

269
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,840
how your pattern match the world for your patent fight on our very first.

270
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,550
But you're even life include forcefully multi line.

271
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,750
It is not working for your second line.

272
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,510
So by default match will look only for one Lenny formal dealings.

273
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,090
Anyway,

274
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,650
have you ever text simply with one line,

275
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,020
one leg?

276
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:48,070
So starting question to look simply generate election on Jiro it index only it will look No

277
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,070
,

278
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,640
let's say now I'm going to write very first line.

279
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,750
As with textract spite onto mostly the result you're getting because that very first we

280
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,450
have a match.

281
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,290
Be clear only at very first.

282
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,750
Now remaining operations are same.

283
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,480
Let me write this as a my object variable.

284
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,950
Let me store that in tow.

285
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,150
Match object equals two.

286
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,000
No,

287
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,700
see the result.

288
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,250
That's it.

289
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,850
Okay,

290
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,780
So that is the difference between such an matches.

291
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,890
Such we look in the entire string,

292
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,750
but it will find only the first match.

293
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,550
But as much we'll look only in the Jordan expedition.

294
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,070
Is there any match for your given pattern at the gelatin explosion in a single line?

295
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,200
Or even though,

296
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,250
if you are multi lines?

297
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,950
Even if you have mentioned forcefully multi line,

298
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,120
it won't work right?

299
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,940
But are you not?

300
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,630
I will work.

301
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,160
Ignore case in ST Let's say I'm writing pattern as Capital P.

302
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,550
Otherwise,

303
00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:00,850
I would like to hear anything else capitals bite onto.

304
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,320
If I don't have the sorry dot I you're not having any match for you were much operation

305
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,500
because here Capitals.

306
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,320
But you're looking with small letters patterns.

307
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Then you ca NBA league,

308
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,460
not kids to case sensitivity,

309
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,850
Are you not I That's it.

310
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,720
I don't even work,

311
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,670
but are your team will not work with your much right.

312
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:22,920
So,

313
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,160
guys,

314
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,850
Finally,

315
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,360
if you ever text with the multi lines,

316
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,390
such will look in any place.

317
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,520
What match will look only in this patient?

318
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,050
That's it.

319
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,280
That is a simple difference,

320
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,060
right?

321
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,330
So finally,

322
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,000
if you won't write a pattern Oh,

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,480
sorry.

324
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,790
Syntax ordered Such your pattern.

325
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,450
It was string.

326
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,650
If you need any flags,

327
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:49,420
you can include the same way for match You can light are not much pattern strings.

328
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,250
If you want,

329
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,110
including the flags,

330
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,500
you can include nothing.

331
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,030
Okay.

332
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay,

333
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,750
guys,

334
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,150
Thank you for watching this with you.
