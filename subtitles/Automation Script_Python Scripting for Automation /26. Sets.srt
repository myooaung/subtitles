1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,370
friends here.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,280
We're going to discuss the loss to default data structure off your python.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,050
That is set in data structure.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,160
Let me weapon my technol and I'm wondering in tow,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
Fight on internal like See if you want to define any set.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,250
Let's say my Sertic was too curly braces with the normal values.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,050
You can't define any value.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,750
Okay,

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,670
See that?

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,300
No,

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm bringing my certain.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:44,450
So the way how you are giving 457270 But it is giving out protests in ascending order.

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,760
That means what the what?

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,150
The data you're providing it is not giving the same order.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,650
That means sets or call on ordered collection off data.

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,420
If you do any data multiple times if you data duplicates that are multiple times off data.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,350
Suppose I have given 72 times.

18
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:12,050
So several do unique data duplicates will be removed by the four.

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,020
That's a now,

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,500
if you can.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,660
What?

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,870
They were data into bullion.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,610
True,

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,660
because it is non empty set,

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:22,950
right?

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,510
Let me define my sort of which is having a non empty ah study Empty.

27
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,890
Sick.

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,680
So,

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:30,940
guys,

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,440
if you want to define empty certain,

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,000
you are to write a set with the poker liberals because if you defend that,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,760
its stride forward the calibrates that will become the story no printed the type off your

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,350
myself.

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,700
No,

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,880
let me bring the bullion off your myself.

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,660
It is a false because empty set,

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:51,950
right?

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,070
So,

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,190
guys these away How you can be fined your set right now you can convert your surgeon two

40
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,150
billion on What is that?

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,170
Whether you're getting when you're 30 is empty.

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,740
Let's say I'm having a big list Tickled.

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,750
My list equals two.

44
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:16,150
You can convert this listing Do sick set off my list.

45
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,250
That's it.

46
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,340
In case you have any data,

47
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,150
multiple times they were Ah,

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,550
a list.

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,770
You're settled duty unique.

50
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,350
They are.

51
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:33,630
That's it on any ladies as ending order.

52
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,070
That means on order the collection actually.

53
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,690
Right,

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,250
Fine.

55
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,400
So if you want to see the different types off operations on you asserts simply can done

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,450
this and you can see,

57
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:52,760
so are you can do it all.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:05,850
Let's say city is that in this week 3456 and said to be Is there in this way 56789 So I

59
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,220
want to find year Union.

60
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,550
Be right here nor union off B C output.

61
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:21,950
Yea Lord in verse six in intersection off B Not okay.

62
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,260
So,

63
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,580
guys,

64
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,240
how there are remaining opens as well.

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,180
But an automation started Know where we are going to touch the societal later structure If

66
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,050
you are industrial against Ah Gorn 11 award your remaining operations on your sets.

67
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,760
Well,

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,770
I gone through only union under section.

69
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,100
If you are interested aboard sets anyway,

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,880
your mathematics sets operationally right.

71
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,420
You can go and see the remaining operations.

72
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,950
Okay.

73
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,100
Okay.

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,750
Thank you for watching this video.
