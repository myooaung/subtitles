ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
friends here.

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.300
We're going to do one simple practice with your furlough.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.180
I mean,

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.050
I'm going to write a simple Python script.

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.140
The requirement.

6
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.750
These really string on print characters under day index values.

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.240
I mean,

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.850
suppose if you run your python skit,

9
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.240
it has to ask,

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.160
Enter your input,

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.430
then enter some import.

12
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.850
Let's say I'm going to under Impetus Python.

13
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.570
Then it has to do out.

14
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.530
Put us in this former B Y T Hatch warrior in at the same time,

15
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.110
it has to bring to the index value off your electors or characters in this way.

16
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.950
Right?

17
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.000
So there's before going to watch the next to part in this video.

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.590
First,

19
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.820
just to pass this video and try to write your script to read some string and to display or

20
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.450
put in this way,

21
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.590
I just You just do your try,

22
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.950
then come back and watch the remaining part right?

23
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.890
OK,

24
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.530
but as I know,

25
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.360
I'm going to write you just pass it on.

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.810
Try Skip from your site.

27
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.920
Okay,

28
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.920
let me sale.

29
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.100
Of course.

30
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.300
I mean,

31
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.650
skip name as read string,

32
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.510
then bring with index values.

33
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.010
Not really.

34
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.150
Night.

35
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.150
See,

36
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.450
You know if you want to read a string What you're to do Let me day user string I'm taking

37
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.890
equals two.

38
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.550
I need to read it String.

39
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.250
You know,

40
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.380
if you want to read a string,

41
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.150
you have to use input Syntax.

42
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.010
Right.

43
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.650
So what I'm doing is and very word string.

44
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.060
Okay,

45
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.480
imagine that use that user is going to enter anything.

46
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.790
Any string right now,

47
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:59.210
what I'm doing is see you for each character in your user string.

48
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.050
Let me print first all characters one by one.

49
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.390
Right now,

50
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.440
Let me my common line because I need to probably input for escape.

51
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.310
So I'm going with this Now.

52
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.550
Let me open your script.

53
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.110
Read strength printed index values.

54
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.070
This is your script?

55
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.700
No,

56
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.750
I'm going to run that script.

57
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.290
Right.

58
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.050
See that?

59
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.610
And that he was thing.

60
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.090
Suppose I'm and drink fight on.

61
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.350
You can enter anything.

62
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.450
So what is happening?

63
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.880
You're wondering.

64
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.790
Fight on what I'm bringing.

65
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.460
Oh,

66
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm bringing use a string.

67
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.000
Not each character I want to print.

68
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.510
Then Elikann get one by one character.

69
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.850
Right.

70
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.950
Okay.

71
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.590
Let me read on.

72
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.260
So before going to rely on.

73
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.540
So,

74
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.780
guys,

75
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.180
what is the Mr Guided means in each and every repetition with your loop.

76
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.530
I'm bringing complete string,

77
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.920
but I should not print complaints.

78
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.250
String.

79
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.680
I want to print character.

80
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.480
But all the character you're getting in two days from your entire string one by one.

81
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.950
That character I want to print.

82
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.520
Not right just now.

83
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.640
I modified us cream.

84
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.900
No,

85
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.250
see,

86
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.300
I'm bringing each character right now.

87
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.790
Let me run your script Once I'm on things up.

88
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.530
Was fight on?

89
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.910
Yes.

90
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.550
You're getting P Y T hatch,

91
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.920
William.

92
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.690
Separately.

93
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.450
Nature never like.

94
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.230
But why printing your character,

95
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.850
right?

96
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.620
What is all required?

97
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.480
Output p some hyphen,

98
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.220
hyphen Adama,

99
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.520
then some indigent number.

100
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.380
So before that,

101
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.950
what I'm doing is see,

102
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.730
I'm taking your strings.

103
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.960
You want a variable value,

104
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.100
then hyphen iPhone?

105
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.800
Suppose in this way.

106
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.050
I'm trying.

107
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.750
You see the output first.

108
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.410
Now I'm running this.

109
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.110
I am providing Sting s python.

110
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.440
Yes,

111
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.410
you're getting P hyphen.

112
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.450
IPhone greater than symbol.

113
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.760
But after that water or do bring Here are two printed 012345 Likewise,

114
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.680
based on the number of characters you have,

115
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.060
these are simply what I'm doing.

116
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.180
Where is your script?

117
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.450
Yeah.

118
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.480
See,

119
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.270
what I'm doing is I'm taking before you are.

120
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.730
Luke.

121
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.670
I'm taking some index value are simply I x are simply index.

122
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.360
Let me take Index equals to Jiro.

123
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.920
Initially,

124
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.400
I'm making next value as Jiro.

125
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.540
Why?

126
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.320
Printing first variable value.

127
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.250
I will print this index as it is.

128
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.250
See that,

129
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.550
right?

130
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.800
No.

131
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.950
First let me run it so that you will get idea.

132
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.990
This is your script.

133
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.080
What I'm doing is I'm printing your character other than index.

134
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.730
What is the index?

135
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.150
Jiro?

136
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.130
So I suppose if we enter piped on I mean while running your escape.

137
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.450
If you enter any string,

138
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.670
some of them and drink fight on.

139
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.970
So then if you Abdul your script,

140
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.460
what will happen this people th win will go on replacing this variable in your look Now

141
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.150
this is B Y t h one.

142
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.420
Now you're loop is going to take one by one character on it is going to store into this

143
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.000
variable on that variable we're printing at the same time We're printing index also but in

144
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.300
next is a constant value.

145
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.600
That's why if I run the escape see the result Water is giving for all calculated for all

146
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.950
characters It is giving Jiro Jiro is not the correct index except your people.

147
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.950
See,

148
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.430
what I want to do is why printing P.

149
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.250
I want to print initial Bellagio.

150
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.000
So you're Loop is going to take second time.

151
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.450
Secondly,

152
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.050
character from your given string.

153
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.910
So before going to second before going to get second character,

154
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.910
what I am doing is after your prince statement inside off your Cole.

155
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.350
I'm increasing index value by one index equals two index plus one.

156
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.550
No,

157
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.770
let me explain here itself.

158
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.190
Supple.

159
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.070
Assume that you are entering string a spite on,

160
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.390
then.

161
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.970
Definitely.

162
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.050
Or python will replace in this way internally.

163
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.490
No.

164
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.830
See,

165
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.500
I am taking for us to be I mean,

166
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.920
your python on it is touring into this variable.

167
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.710
Then after that,

168
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.980
whatever the lines you have,

169
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.550
those lines will repeat once,

170
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.350
right?

171
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.410
So while printing this index barely initially,

172
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.950
it is Jiro.

173
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.650
That's why Geno will print.

174
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.080
Then your bite on will exclude next line.

175
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.380
So what you are doing you are increasing your next valid your A +11 now in your hand.

176
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.250
Next Wellies one.

177
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.250
Then you're part and will go on,

178
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.850
take next to character from your given string way.

179
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.560
That's why we're storing into this and then you're printing by on while Printing index,

180
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.820
What is the current index value?

181
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.170
Euro +11 Know your printing one right now.

182
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.410
Currently Next is one.

183
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.760
Then after this line,

184
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.860
what you're doing again,

185
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.300
you are increasing in next value one plus one.

186
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.670
Now that is to that means before going to take third character you are making your next

187
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.780
value has to So third character next is always to only write because 012 so likewise

188
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.520
automatically you are increasing your variable Corley,

189
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.810
you're required index.

190
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.260
So now you are required.

191
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.640
Skip,

192
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.250
you got it.

193
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.820
Not only Python,

194
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.110
you can take any variable.

195
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.590
Let me run on Provide simply scripting.

196
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.750
He's here.

197
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:37.180
Good one for automation mostly the result Space is also one character You need to remember

198
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.800
that right See automatically are getting for each and every character.

199
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:49.050
We are getting index values like So if you are able to understand these three lines on why

200
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.850
you have given indexing D'Costa Jiro before you are Luke,

201
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.350
then you are good with your lips.

202
00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:01.410
Suppose if I'd guys this logic you can implement in different ways But I'm giving just for

203
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.690
the world get your idea on your loops.

204
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.770
I'm giving in this way.

205
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.550
This example.

206
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.200
My in case,

207
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.550
if you write in Mexico studio inside off your loop,

208
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:21.600
then before printing your line always you're making next valley Jiro then even know if we

209
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.600
change here before printing this line again.

210
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.110
You're making next value of Jiro.

211
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.180
Always will get Jiro.

212
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.880
That's why whenever,

213
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.100
if you want to initialize any variable,

214
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.590
right initial value,

215
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.850
it should be there always before you were Lou.

216
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.270
Nothing.

217
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.350
Now you take you and simply some fight on.

218
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.450
No problem not to like.

219
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.750
Okay.

220
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.150
Okay,

221
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.490
guys,

222
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.750
Thank you for watching this for you.
