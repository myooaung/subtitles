00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
friends here.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.490
We're going to discuss some more operations on your strings.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.620
But the result off this operations is a Boolean data.

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.750
That means the result you will get like either true or false.

5
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.810
Right?

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.430
Let me take the operations off your strings,

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.750
which will do the result as a 1,000,000,000 data.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.990
So before that,

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.450
guys let me weapon my piped on shell.

10
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.350
I mean,

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.360
first the command line.

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.090
Then type python on.

13
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.360
You will enter into a fight on terminal right there.

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.340
Defined any string.

15
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.450
Let's say my stringy cause too.

16
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.560
Hello?

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.260
Anything.

18
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.460
Then simply print a DEA,

19
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.250
your off my string.

20
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.330
You have here different operations,

21
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.580
right?

22
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.330
Only we know how to get this operations.

23
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.780
And already we have seen some of the operations like upper title swap case.

24
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.250
Right.

25
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.190
And then lower capitalized something.

26
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.550
Case for we have seen.

27
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.580
No,

28
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.050
I want to go with some other operations,

29
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.410
sort of that the result should be either true or false or whatever the operations were

30
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.000
going to discuss.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.350
No,

32
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.750
that operations reserves is like a true or false are simply a 1,000,000,000 data.

33
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.610
Let's take very simple operation.

34
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.000
Forced the ends of it.

35
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Right?

36
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.840
Guys,

37
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.150
let me weapon my ended up so I'm going toe right A python script name for their right.

38
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:45.920
So let me take by them Skip Name us 1,000,000,000 reserved string operations.

39
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.690
So these are prisons are very,

40
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.650
very helpful in your real time.

41
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.050
Let's say I am taking my string equals to support simply fightin Look,

42
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:11.840
it know what I'm doing is I'm checking my string dot Start with look happy is your starting

43
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.400
with B.

44
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.200
In that case,

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.870
you list this operation said output false.

46
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.220
The reason is you're starting with a capital P,

47
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.350
but you're checking with small P now.

48
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.230
Is it starting with a capital B?

49
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.600
Yes,

50
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.950
True.

51
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.220
Right.

52
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.160
So you will take this type off operations in your conditional statements so you'll come to

53
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.790
know that how to use this before then We just try toe under the or put the same.

54
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.210
But I can check not only with single letter gates.

55
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.630
I can also check with world also no problem.

56
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.850
My string dot starts with Let's say,

57
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.980
fight on,

58
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.840
no problem.

59
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.790
Just ticket.

60
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.160
Yes,

61
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.750
it's true,

62
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.350
right?

63
00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:00.690
The same bay You can also check like bring my string door ends with.

64
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.950
He's joining with him.

65
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.440
You can take it a single letter or let's say I'm taking Hatuey and Mobile.

66
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.000
I mean group off characters.

67
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.200
Also,

68
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.820
you can check it.

69
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.950
The only thing is,

70
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.350
if the given string is ending with actually and then you will get output as a proof.

71
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.530
Not so.

72
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.800
This is starting on ending.

73
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.270
Right?

74
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.590
Then let me weapon.

75
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.050
You were comments.

76
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:35.250
I'm in your panel and see that Let me take something called Let's Say is lower.

77
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.880
You're like ways you know,

78
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.950
so many operations like me.

79
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.550
Take is lower print.

80
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.540
My string dot is lower.

81
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.120
I mean,

82
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.830
is it is it in lower case letters?

83
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.250
No,

84
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.170
because foster risk capital remaining will are small.

85
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.750
That's where you get over as a false.

86
00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.100
So don't put then Ghozi's lower is up for this type of our presence are important in your

87
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.630
real time.

88
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.350
He's upper.

89
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.750
These also falls because your letter your strings,

90
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.890
your string characters are not all characters off your sting or not in upper case only

91
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.150
first,

92
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.250
little that's what you're getting is a poor as false.

93
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.450
Let me take my string dot He's title.

94
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.660
Yes,

95
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.490
you'll get a true you know what?

96
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.130
Battle is nothing,

97
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.570
but if you also some multiple worsening given string.

98
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.790
The first little off your each and every word should be a capital.

99
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.980
That farmer is there.

100
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.170
No,

101
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.490
that's we're getting through.

102
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.640
Suppose if I are something like fight on tutorials No,

103
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.660
you'll get false because in the second word t small Let me take it as a capital on ticket

104
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.950
now.

105
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.740
Yes,

106
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.490
no to true.

107
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.550
All right.

108
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.950
So tightly is done like waste.

109
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.060
Let me take some either space.

110
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.880
So is there any space in a given string?

111
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.550
Is there any space in a given string so far that you can use this operation?

112
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.830
He's a space.

113
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.440
Yes,

114
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.140
we have a space.

115
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.360
No,

116
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.390
that's what you're going to get over.

117
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.600
But as a sunny,

118
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.130
he's a space you're having along with your space.

119
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.090
You're having letters as well,

120
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.350
right?

121
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.910
Let me take one more example here only space.

122
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.190
The thing is,

123
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.190
my new string is only space,

124
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.600
right?

125
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.800
No check on your new stream.

126
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.270
He's a space heater.

127
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.040
Displace Yes,

128
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.450
a group.

129
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.550
But if he abs only were given string my stream.

130
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.390
It is the combination off spaces and someone for bit not right is giving result on this

131
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.950
false right.

132
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.950
That's fine.

133
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:08.940
No let me go with one more thing is all for right is all for nothing but easy was strained

134
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.360
consist off only Alphabet's my new string Let me take my sting,

135
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.170
not mine Oosting,

136
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.250
let me take our stink.

137
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.080
So what is the Wall Street first?

138
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.830
Let me friend it this one,

139
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.080
right?

140
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.500
Is it all for Yes Bruno.

141
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.080
What?

142
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.910
You're getting false.

143
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.600
You have space space Space is not the alpha bed,

144
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.940
right?

145
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.550
Let me through that space.

146
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.810
No.

147
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.450
See that Put?

148
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.850
You're getting proof night.

149
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.870
So space is not alphabet.

150
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.960
That's why he's all for giving false.

151
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.040
If you remove the transit will,

152
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.550
you were true.

153
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.310
That's fine.

154
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.010
Now let me go with the one more thing called use numeric for your numbers,

155
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.350
right is printable Night you can print.

156
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.080
He started Liza part.

157
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.540
Let me take one more thing called is Yeah.

158
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.270
I will take this one.

159
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.150
Use numeric.

160
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.620
See that I'm checking.

161
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:19.250
Bring my string dot is numeric What is outward you're getting or about us?

162
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.500
My new sting.

163
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.850
Sorry.

164
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.510
That is coming or No.

165
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.580
Let me take my stream.

166
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.140
See,

167
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.380
that is my new string is no different because we come into that.

168
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.320
That's why fighting is enabled.

169
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.530
Identified that variable Anyway,

170
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.980
it's fine.

171
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.450
No seed or put all your getting false is numerous.

172
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.640
See hours Thing is not numeric no,

173
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.350
or string consist off alphabets.

174
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.100
Let's really find your strain equals two.

175
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.150
Something rich consist off only numbers.

176
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.710
Yes,

177
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.590
String which consists off numbers.

178
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.310
No city output.

179
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.980
You're getting proved because they're string consist off.

180
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.850
Only numbers use numeric.

181
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.430
Right?

182
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.260
So guys,

183
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.900
this type off all prisons are very,

184
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.750
very important.

185
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.680
Right?
