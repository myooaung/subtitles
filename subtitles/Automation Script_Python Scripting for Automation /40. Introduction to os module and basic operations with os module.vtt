00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
friends here we're going to discuss about waste model operating system model,

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.290
which is very,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.760
very important whenever if you're going toe automate your tasks are server side because the

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.310
ways model using this way,

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.710
it's morning.

6
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.450
You can work or interact with your operating system.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.960
See whenever If you're able to interact with your operating system,

8
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.630
you can automate some tasks like creating that it really moving,

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.890
changing your territory,

10
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.750
knowing your territory right on many more.

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.980
So that's why this is very,

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.500
very important on Just to get confidence on your ways model myself,

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.850
I'm dividing this model.

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.760
As for parts that is simply ways and where's that part,

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.150
then waste our system on in ways not walk.

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.150
That means I want to explain this waste model with step by step.

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.830
So in this video,

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.790
we're going to see some simple operations with your ways model.

19
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.950
Right?

20
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.750
See,

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.010
this is a model right where it's model.

22
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.810
That means using this Ways model,

23
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.860
you can work with your Windows operating systems as well as UNIX like systems like Let me

24
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.490
take Buddy,

25
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.670
a simple variable from your waist model.

26
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.130
You know,

27
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.850
model is always consist off some functions and variables,

28
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.030
right are simply what you consist of.

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.920
Some operations.

30
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.050
One of the operation is ways dot Separator.

31
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.810
What is this way is not separator.

32
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.680
See if I take some Windows operating system part right,

33
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.250
let me take this spot.

34
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.600
Did.

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.450
Slash is called warriors to separate that on your windows.

36
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.150
Let me take You are UNIX systems.

37
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.200
So no,

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.920
these are different Slash,

39
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.260
right?

40
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.000
This is slash.

41
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.150
Is this operator for UNIX like systems?

42
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.550
No.

43
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.220
If you want to set some what separated you need to set manually based on your operating

44
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.730
system.

45
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.090
Python will set it.

46
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.650
Suppose let me enter into my python terminal.

47
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.030
And you know you know what?

48
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.350
If you want to use ways modern,

49
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.910
you hardly import your ways,

50
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.950
right?

51
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.750
And then to see list off your waist.

52
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.180
Ah,

53
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.750
model operations simply.

54
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.420
You can run the air off ways.

55
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.510
So these all are the operations with your ways.

56
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.050
But I'm going to divide this into four parts and I'm going to explain that step by step.

57
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.670
Right.

58
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.100
So you know,

59
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.110
that guy's these all are like some of the some of them are functions and some of them are

60
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.650
variables.

61
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.490
If you want to know which is a function which is a variable.

62
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.550
You had to go with help.

63
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.550
If you press sender right,

64
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.860
you're going to get your ways model information with the functions and then some data.

65
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.250
Right?

66
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.710
So if you want to see,

67
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.620
you can go through that.

68
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.750
I'm not going with that.

69
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.730
Let me simply print on your Windows operating system.

70
00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.800
Where is not separated.

71
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.540
You're getting slash.

72
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.770
Same way.

73
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.740
Let me go with your UNIX like systems.

74
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.010
I'm going to undergo my Pitre internal on my UNIX system.

75
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.950
That Islamic system let me import ways first.

76
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.160
Then I am printing ways.

77
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.780
Dots,

78
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.350
Operator.

79
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.660
Right automatically.

80
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.190
Based on your operating system,

81
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.330
Python is finding No,

82
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.340
these the different slash,

83
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.650
right?

84
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.550
Fine,

85
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.040
No.

86
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.170
Let us assume that that is a gym that I have a some simple directory called Let me take on

87
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.150
my desktop.

88
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.520
Okay.

89
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.150
I'm going to create some directory new territory like height.

90
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.800
Then I'm going to create one more directory,

91
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.850
One more directory.

92
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.450
Let me create it simply.

93
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.550
I'm going to create like ah,

94
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.750
I will take new.

95
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.050
Fine.

96
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.950
No,

97
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.250
let me take this part.

98
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.680
So parties always a string guys,

99
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.950
if you go with anywhere,

100
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.050
right parties are resisting Let me take parties This one I am starting into some variable

101
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.440
First I will take high This is my path like Okay,

102
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.350
you're getting some head up Then let me take new also see why e anybody to take apart your

103
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.960
bite is giving some error But if I take on your next like systems,

104
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.520
right?

105
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:43.770
Ah let me take party cause too Home issue to user Right now it's taking perfectly the same

106
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.400
thing Let me take different parts injured off this one Let me take some u f then in that

107
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.510
let me take some fight on videos Something like that moat taking that he's Noida.

108
00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.400
Why you are getting an error whenever If your are sending a part to some variable not only

109
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:16.430
variable Even if you try to print your party will get another See that The reason is guys

110
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.440
you know in your pipe and your some special characters like slash and slash t slash are I

111
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.650
slash we on then slash u is a unicorn,

112
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.350
right?

113
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.920
That's why you are aware that special case purpose you have to provide two slashes in your

114
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.010
pipe and not see that there is no problem by taking in this way.

115
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.010
So this this,

116
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.300
the problem is with you were only Windows operating system.

117
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.890
Not with your UNIX like systems,

118
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.520
because in UNIX like systems,

119
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.950
the part separated this one.

120
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.730
But Windows is the part separated on,

121
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.930
you know slash and is the special character slash out of the special characters last year

122
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.850
with some unicorn?

123
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.620
That's why that's why whenever,

124
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.270
if you're providing apart on your Windows operating systems,

125
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.780
always whether it is having some special characters are not,

126
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.780
try to provide in slough.

127
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.560
Single Slash Just try to pull a two slashes by providing to Slash is there is no problem

128
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.740
with your windows,

129
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.980
but if you don't provide,

130
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.250
sometimes you will get an Arab.

131
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.910
If you don't provide two slashes in your path,

132
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.970
sometimes there is a chance to get another.

133
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.010
That's why just toe are wide and a even by mistake to all radio.

134
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.120
Another try to take always two slices in your part.

135
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.430
That is the good practice.

136
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.550
Just remember this point.

137
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.510
That's fine.

138
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.210
Now what is the next operation?

139
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.520
Where's dot get CWD guys to know your current working directory on Windows,

140
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.950
you are to run city comin on your UNIX 300 beautifully command.

141
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.130
But enough running this one on this one based on your operating system just to go and run

142
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.900
this it respect you off your operating system.

143
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.050
Python will take care on W the current working directory.

144
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.750
See that I am going to take fast windows.

145
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.600
Let me print.

146
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.670
Let me print ways dot Get cwd See that you're getting some part.

147
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.880
Let me go and run it on the world.

148
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:18.430
Unique says mom ways dot Get cwd I can also send this out put into some variable Saudi How

149
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.580
given some extra parent assists right?

150
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.550
Are let me take current working directory variable.

151
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:37.360
I cannot sign ways dot get cwd and then I can print that CWD No problem not to she Now you

152
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.160
no need to worry about your operating system generally to get your current working verity

153
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.100
on Windows er to run city comin on your UNIX like systems the order and PWD command.

154
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.370
But if you go with bite on you don't worry about which operating system you're using to get

155
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.350
your current territory.

156
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.860
I think we'll take care there.

157
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.550
The only thing you have to remember where is that get Setiabudi.

158
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.950
That's it,

159
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.670
then.

160
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.450
Ways not changed that It Lee,

161
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.690
let me do one thing as off.

162
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:05.940
No,

163
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.160
you are under this location.

164
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.440
See?

165
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.500
Users Automation.

166
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.750
Now I want to move into a different location.

167
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.850
Then simply run,

168
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.450
you know script also You can use this where his daughter changed at a tree.

169
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.360
Guys,

170
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.510
you're probably party to reach location You want to move Body is always a string And

171
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.250
remember that you are working on windows.

172
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.150
You are to provide two slashes in your part.

173
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.500
Okay?

174
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.340
How do we have providing?

175
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.020
ST Patrick,

176
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:36.380
let me remove this automation Previously you are under this location Now I am moving into

177
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.350
this location with help of the syntax.

178
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.060
No See that?

179
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.500
What is the current location?

180
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.000
Where you how using?

181
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.890
Get Setiabudi not to Same thing.

182
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.070
You can do it on your inaccessible right?

183
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.690
Let me do it.

184
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.750
At least this one on your next like systems.

185
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.950
So I want to move with his daughter.

186
00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:05.470
Change that It three just I want to move into home location now See that where you are not

187
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.710
to.

188
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.690
So there is.

189
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.050
Make sure that while working with UNIX like systems known don't provide any type of double

190
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.160
slashes in your path,

191
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.850
but even knows you're to provide it,

192
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.190
right?

193
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.750
Fine.

194
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.050
See?

195
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.350
Again To list some files on windows,

196
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.630
you had to use the air common on planets.

197
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.750
We are to use a less common.

198
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.130
But he should have that.

199
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.380
Simply You can use ways,

200
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.710
daughter.

201
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.970
Listen,

202
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.550
territories right,

203
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.710
Let me run it on my Lennox.

204
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.300
At least Cindy condone it.

205
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:35.830
Only were.

206
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.290
We know,

207
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.710
says will.

208
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.850
Print wears door list.

209
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.280
That increase.

210
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.750
See the output,

211
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.240
right?

212
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.320
Are ways I will do.

213
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.050
One thing weighs.

214
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.340
Don't change that a tree.

215
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.050
I want to movinto whom you see two user.

216
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.880
So in this location,

217
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.560
I want to list so you can move on and then you can list are basically you can do one thing

218
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.560
.

219
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.350
Let me do it.

220
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.000
Ways door,

221
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.950
brain.

222
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.110
Well,

223
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.310
yes dot list directory.

224
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.520
You can also provide part for which location you need to list out your values.

225
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:10.930
I mean,

226
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.050
files and directories using in this way.

227
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.100
I think I need a broader and more parentheses.

228
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.570
Fine.

229
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.150
See that?

230
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.260
See where is not listed?

231
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.250
Directory is going toe.

232
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.420
Take a part or if you don't blow it apart,

233
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.130
it will take your current location as a part on it.

234
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.150
Released the in the current location.

235
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:38.030
Whatever the files and doctors are there on output is always at least make sure that what

236
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.800
good is always a list.

237
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.060
You don't remember this because sometimes unit toe.

238
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.390
Use this or put right.

239
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:43.910
Fine.

240
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.450
So ways not least territory without part with the part.

241
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.870
Then where's dot Make verity See?

242
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.370
You can use this just to create order territory.

243
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.930
Maybe on windows are units you can practice with your windows as well.

244
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.460
In case I am doing as off No.

245
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.120
One Lennox.

246
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.300
What?

247
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.770
You can do it.

248
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.650
Same thing on Windows.

249
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.050
Husband.

250
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.600
See as off.

251
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.940
No,

252
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.080
in the current location.

253
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.570
First,

254
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.180
let me check.

255
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.890
What are the files and directories are there with help off ways dot List that it,

256
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:12.450
please.

257
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.210
So,

258
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:13.860
current location.

259
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.870
No need to provide part.

260
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.120
Yes,

261
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.510
I know.

262
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.890
What I'm doing is wears dot magnolia tree.

263
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.600
I'm going to create Suppose not in Red Electric.

264
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.950
What happened?

265
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:32.040
Maybe who we are under home location.

266
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.960
Right home.

267
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.360
I don't know.

268
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.180
Permission for that.

269
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.500
Let me movinto my home.

270
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.100
It was easy to use their home.

271
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:45.580
Where's dot change directory then through to home the road home.

272
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.310
I don't know permissions in that location.

273
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.250
That's why I had to enter into my location.

274
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.060
Easy to user,

275
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.910
then.

276
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.330
Here,

277
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.140
I can make a flower it recall.

278
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.190
Suppose anything Not in the right.

279
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.450
No waste dot list directories,

280
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.550
sir.

281
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.180
Previously,

282
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.460
we ran ways that lister to this location.

283
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.830
See the list of files under to see hope.

284
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.060
Now,

285
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.670
see that you have somewhere.

286
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.370
Not in the previous.

287
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.330
You are not having this.

288
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.160
You're Amir and June toe the 19.

289
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.730
But between June until the 1900 we got just know we created that will help operators dark,

290
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.530
make their all right.

291
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.250
Fine.

292
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.090
And make sure that gays whenever if you're providing aid,

293
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.910
directly name.

294
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.230
That is also a string.

295
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:38.530
You are to ride inside off the quotation find the next one is where's dot Make directories

296
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.450
and then part.

297
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.210
That means if it is in the current location,

298
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.940
you can use words dot magda tree,

299
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.890
but like a silly if you want to create,

300
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:47.910
I mean support.

301
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.320
I assume that you are in somewhere home.

302
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.750
Is you to use that in this part?

303
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.530
You how now I want to create some X rays er in that x rated I want to create the X.

304
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.250
So arcade time I want to create X wiser now than in the TX reconsidered.

305
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.550
I want to create this part.

306
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.440
Then at that time,

307
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:11.770
your takeaways don't make direct priests see that If I take simply where's dot Make that

308
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.210
three.

309
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:20.630
Suppose I want to create under you to me I want to create exquisite and then export right?

310
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.650
It's not possible.

311
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:30.760
But if I take ways dot Make this one night poise dot Make that it please models.

312
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.450
After that,

313
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.800
Under you,

314
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.080
they mean I want to create X razor on.

315
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.770
Then in that X I want to create right now,

316
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.800
just list ways door list directory.

317
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.360
You are you I mean,

318
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.550
see the result,

319
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.650
right?

320
00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:02.530
Not to otherwise come out here unless you tell me now,

321
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.320
Rick Astley,

322
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.920
you can see I think using you three command.

323
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.010
See that?

324
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.370
Sorry.

325
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.530
Maybe three is not there.

326
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.350
Let me install it.

327
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.290
So,

328
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:16.750
um installed three command so that you can see the casali three.

329
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.450
You to me.

330
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.730
See that inside you To me You get exposure inside that the x So,

331
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.290
Rick Absolutely.

332
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.440
If you want to create you have to use ways.

333
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.810
Don't make directories.

334
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.150
No,

335
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.580
To remove some part.

336
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.700
You can use ways not removed right and then becomes truly if you want to remove.

337
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.160
I mean,

338
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.280
just know we created reconciliate right under your give me X ray j dinner that ux No.

339
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.410
If you want to clear the X our reconciliate this exquisite under your enemy,

340
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.190
then you have to use ways don't removed at a tree.

341
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.350
Then you are part what is always history.

342
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.510
Then he can also create some directly using simply ways not remove directory.

343
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.840
Right.

344
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.550
So these are some of these simple your waist operations along with that,

345
00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:04.840
if you want to rename some filing right ways door rename source location,

346
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.150
destination location both must be a string we just played.

347
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.380
Then why does not anyone which is very,

348
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.070
very important case See,

349
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.810
Let me run it on my common line.

350
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.650
E and we comer,

351
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.950
you're getting some anyone mint variable values off your operating system,

352
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.250
right?

353
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.450
No.

354
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.230
Same things.

355
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.500
You can get it if you tell your fight on as well.

356
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.170
I mean,

357
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.690
your windows are Lennox operating system and new Norment variables.

358
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:37.850
You can get it with the help off ways dot Get envy drawn.

359
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:46.030
See that put women get simply sorry.

360
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.100
Where is not a new dawn?

361
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.750
Yeah,

362
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.330
Where?

363
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:48.840
His daughter.

364
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:57.980
He and we I and you don't What happened?

365
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:06.050

Apparently,

415
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.400
it is pretty off your per operating system.

416
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.420
See,

417
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.220
we told your bite on If you want to run support changed at a tree.
