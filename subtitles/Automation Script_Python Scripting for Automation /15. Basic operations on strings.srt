1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,950
friends in this Rio We're going toe work with bite on strings or strings.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,180
Variables on.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,010
We're going to discuss Onley.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,850
Very basics.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,580
In the next year,

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,700
we will see some good ones level operations with your strengths.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,640
Right,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,200
Fine.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,480
So yes,

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:17,820
you are.

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,210
You know,

12
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,970
some basic Sophia strings.

13
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,910
Let me start with introduction.

14
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,250
What is a string and fight on?

15
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,050
First of all,

16
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:34,420
it may be invite on R C or Java wherever teas string is simply a sequence off characters CV

17
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,950
How you know,

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,900
a desert,

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,650
some 26 characters,

20
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,510
small and capital,

21
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,740
right.

22
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,320
And also we have some symbols,

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,790
like a dollar car.

24
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,650
It right slash on and hash are the rate.

25
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,050
All are also characters,

26
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,980
right?

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,850
So you have a lot off characters with your to create your strength.

28
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,150
Like then that character is simply a symbol,

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,650
for example,

30
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,050
right?

31
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,300
We already seen this Then see,

32
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,430
even though if your provided were information as a string while writing you are not only

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,800
fight on with any language computer,

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,430
do not deal with your characters.

35
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,590
40 with your strings.

36
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,850
They deal with numbers that is binary numbers.

37
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,450
Even though you may see characters on your screen internally the store and manipulated as a

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,550
combination off binary numbers.

39
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,450
They are like jurors on ones,

40
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,940
but you don't bother about how took on what he was stringing toe by.

41
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,260
Neri's right,

42
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,600
Your fight on software,

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,690
you're quite an interpreter will take care of that way,

44
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,750
lining your fight on program or fight on script,

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,410
right?

46
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,100
So the conversion of Carter's to a number is called,

47
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,710
including,

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,650
I Mean,

49
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,360
the conversion off your characters in terms Off binary is called,

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,150
including on the reverse process is called De Corti.

51
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,200
So there now two types off,

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,010
including techniques.

53
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,550
They're like asking and unique or which are popular.

54
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,590
So previously,

55
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,590
the most of the including is in terms off a ski.

56
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,970
Now the ah,

57
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,850
including technique all most of the languages they're using unique or technique right.

58
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,650
So in Buyten's thing is a sequence off unique or character.

59
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,520
Unicord was introduced to include every character in all languages on bring uniformly in,

60
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,300
including right.

61
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:40,150
So simply that is one of the mechanism to convert the world our data into wineries.

62
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,280
But you don't bother about that.

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,590
If you want to know much about this unique or technique,

64
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,230
are some asking Unicord technique.

65
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,210
You just google it.

66
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,850
You will get a lot of stuff for that.

67
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,750
Right?

68
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,480
Find what our dusting is there Europe item that is a unique or character Are Unicord screen

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,150
night?

70
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,610
That's fine.

71
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,720
Then how do create a string in vital?

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
Yes.

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,750
For this I'm going toe weapon.

74
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,320
My sublime texture.

75
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,960
Taste Don't get confused.

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,980
Sometimes I'm using we a murder.

77
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,560
Sometimes I'm using pyjamas.

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,150
Sometimes I'm using sibling text.

79
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,450
They So if you're confusing,

80
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,080
just try to use Veum from command line.

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,950
That is very simple.

82
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,550
Or you can use by jumped X as well.

83
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,830
But if you take sublime text,

84
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,020
someone text won't accept input from you seeing your previous videos,

85
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,180
right,

86
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,170
We have seen somewhere input on some output statements.

87
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,680
So input.

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,570
We are reading something from your common line.

89
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,470
So that thing is not possible with help off sibling text,

90
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,810
it is possible with your pie,

91
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,850
chum or simply from your VM editors.

92
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,550
Right?

93
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,400
That's okay.

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,940
First,

95
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm going to show you how to create a sting and bite from you guys Already we have seen

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,120
somewhere,

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,900
while discussing about different types off date us or data types in your fight on about

98
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,750
your string called Defining String Late.

99
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,040
Let me go with one second about your strings because it is very,

100
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,800
very important.

101
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,180
Working with strings is very,

102
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,450
very important when writing your real time scripts,

103
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,850
right?

104
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,710
Let me go with my common line.

105
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,310
They're having this thing here.

106
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,550
I'm going to write simply,

107
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,880
like were in direction do strings.

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:29,730
Not feeling you guys let let's say any variable.

109
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,050
I'm taking my name.

110
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,320
Write my name.

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,650
It goes to simply I'm writing.

112
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,080
Suppose.

113
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,050
Let's say not interrupt.

114
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,600
Not just know we defined a variable called my name on in that we stored a string chord.

115
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,090
Narendra,

116
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,880
right?

117
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,900
Let let's say it's up.

118
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,150
Was my new name,

119
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,050
right?

120
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,850
Some fight on?

121
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,810
No.

122
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,150
But see,

123
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,550
I can take a There's single courts or double course through representive of string.

124
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,650
Right?

125
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,640
All right,

126
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm going to take my right.

127
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,310
I can also write in this way tribal courts.

128
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,650
Nobody can take either single or double or treble courts.

129
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,050
Let let's say I started,

130
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,760
like India as,

131
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,780
um at me.

132
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,830
All right,

133
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:42,610
more in both automation team state.

134
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,280
See,

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,720
guys here.

136
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,440
My intention is how do you single double and triple courts let let's say I want to print

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,550
all the variables.

138
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,160
My name is so here.

139
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,510
I want to bring my name.

140
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,650
Let's say variable is my name,

141
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,920
right?

142
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,270
So whatever the information,

143
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,110
I hope that I want to print in the next lane.

144
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,420
That's why I'm taking slash and then I'm breaking.

145
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,670
My new name is so here.

146
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,150
I want to print like my new name.

147
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,660
Then after that,

148
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,950
I want to print some more information on that is my in four is so very Please,

149
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,950
you are in for my in four.

150
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,650
Right?

151
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,950
Then close it.

152
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,450
Save it,

153
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,380
Andranik.

154
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,350
And see the output.

155
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,850
You're getting your information perfectly.

156
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,900
Whether you're going to use singular double or triple courts,

157
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,700
that is no problem.

158
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,050
Right?

159
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,650
Know what I'm doing is see,

160
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,150
I am taking people courts.

161
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,710
And,

162
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,150
uh,

163
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,450
in this way I'm writing my string.

164
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,470
No,

165
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,650
See,

166
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,970
that would put how you're going to get No.

167
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,200
Whatever you are providing inside off tribal courts,

168
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,800
maybe a single line or multiple lines the same format will be preserved even while printing

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:04,800
.

170
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,930
So if you want to write multiple lines,

171
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,060
go on,

172
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,300
take level courts.

173
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,950
Right.

174
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,200
So single,

175
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,630
double or triple courts,

176
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,540
you can take people.

177
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,750
Courts also for always.

178
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,000
But whenever If you want to write multiple lines off information,

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,700
they only go on.

180
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,440
Take civil courts.

181
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,770
See,

182
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,380
I have taken the information between tribal courts as the two lines.

183
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,970
That's where your information is.

184
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,750
Two lines after that last output,

185
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,010
right?

186
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,350
So that's the way how you can I mean,

187
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,650
create history,

188
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,450
then hopeful axes categories in your strength.

189
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:49,810
Let's say I'm going to take let me come into all those things with the civil courts.

190
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,310
Say you can also use table course to comment,

191
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,050
right?

192
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,880
No,

193
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:01,250
I'm takings up was my name are my favorite scripting.

194
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:09,150
This is a variable I'm taking Simply fight on stripping is my photo Okay,

195
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,550
there's one more thing Let me show you that Ah,

196
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:23,220
my string I'm taking like this one Our my new string I'm taking like this one so faster

197
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,070
string is empty string nothing Second string is even though if you have a space space is

198
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,290
also one of the character in your python scripting I'm not sure about other scripting

199
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,950
languages but in bite on space is also one under scripting Sorry.

200
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:43,450
Space is also one of the character Let me bring you know if I can work,

201
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,050
right?

202
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,050
Any data into bullion?

203
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,550
You for these having something,

204
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,350
then you will get true.

205
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,140
If it is having nothing,

206
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,400
then you will get false,

207
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
right?

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,780
I forgot to provide single quotation ending.

209
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,950
I don't see that put false because this is empty in job that let me take my new string on.

210
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,140
See,

211
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:14,720
the output you're getting prove means because something is there that something is space.

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,500
Space is also one of the character,

213
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:16,710
you know,

214
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,180
Remember,

215
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,920
this is also very,

216
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,950
very important point.

217
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,950
That's fine.

218
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,600
No,

219
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:22,980
Grace,

220
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,150
what I'm doing is I'm going to print my entire string.

221
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,630
Of course,

222
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,950
you can use your format and you can print in this way,

223
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,450
right?

224
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:39,980
What you can also you simply print my favorite skipping motor valley.

225
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,170
You'll get output for both,

226
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,150
right?

227
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,060
Based on situation,

228
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,950
you will select that.

229
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,250
So now I'm going toe other former off your print in this week.

230
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,390
So if I printed simply variable,

231
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,650
you are going to get the entire spring right now.

232
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,220
What I want is I want to get I suppose some first A character from your string or some last

233
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,780
character from using or some part off your string.

234
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,950
Then how you can access right?

235
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,290
See before going toe that I wanted you an explanation about index values.

236
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,870
Let's say you have a world called Python.

237
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,390
Simply,

238
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,250
your swing is simply python B Y t hedge,

239
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,400
William,

240
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,650
let me do one thing.

241
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,250
B Y O b Hoech.

242
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,390
William,

243
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,050
this is your string.

244
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,750
Just assume that,

245
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,120
but nobody.

246
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,930
If you are saying any string like this for your variable,

247
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,090
let's say my string I'm taking my are simply my costume I'm doing in this way,

248
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,150
right.

249
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,950
Your python will assign some positions for your characters which are there in your string.

250
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:52,100
So very first character is index Eljero Second characters index one second Authorities in

251
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,920
next to forties in next three.

252
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,050
This is 500 sees,

253
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,750
but this is for on last one is fight.

254
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,950
So these are the positions off your characters We taught there in your given string.

255
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,990
Likewise,

256
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,740
for your pie town skipping If you take this variable than this is Jiro.

257
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:21,340
12345 spaces Also one character 6789 10 11 12 13 14 15 Do you know to 15 Index values are

258
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,700
there for your given string,

259
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,250
right?

260
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,050
Let's say I'm taking simply python only.

261
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,650
Okay,

262
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,380
See,

263
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,090
that would put first.

264
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,150
You're getting your python.

265
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,650
Know what I'm doing is simply am printing.

266
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,780
You are a favorite stripping in square brackets.

267
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,810
I'm taking zero and see the output.

268
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,450
What you're getting.

269
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,040
We're getting P because P position is Jiro or P index.

270
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,190
Value is Jiro.

271
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,350
That's why we're getting that.

272
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:56,870
Let's say I want to bring last little young from your given string last as of no your last

273
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,550
indexes fight.

274
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,030
See that?

275
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,050
That's a so based on index value,

276
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,850
you can access particular character from your given strength.

277
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,550
So these these are the past two index values you can also I'm in.

278
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,950
Pipeline will also assign negative index values from right to left.

279
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,410
Any that minus one.

280
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:26,230
So three minus four minus phi I minus six so you can work with negative as well as

281
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,180
posturing Nexus.

282
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,270
Based on your requirement,

283
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,910
you can go with pause to or negative.

284
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:37,160
Let's say I want to bring starting in starting letter starting character from your given

285
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,580
string,

286
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,790
then for your starting character,

287
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,550
always in extra Jiro the same b,

288
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:48,350
the ending ending character and in character indexes.

289
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,580
If you go it pause to emit a country.

290
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,910
But if you go with the negative,

291
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,050
it is always minus one.

292
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:59,060
So this starting character in Dixie Jiro ending character indexes,

293
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,190
maybe in terms off past of your toe cone.

294
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,600
But if you go with the negative,

295
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,050
it is always to minus one.

296
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,370
This is very,

297
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,990
very important.

298
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,160
Well,

299
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,750
working with your real time scripts,

300
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,690
let's say I want to print biting for the last two character.

301
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,970
I don't know what it is there.

302
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,110
I don't want to come to the end expressions.

303
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,550
Also,

304
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,510
by default,

305
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,570
I can take minus one.

306
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,030
No,

307
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,210
see,

308
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,500
that would put what you're going to get.

309
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,550
You're going to get young.

310
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,910
No need to count.

311
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:28,050
0123455 is the last index are and last character index.

312
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,280
But if we can take minus one,

313
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,520
which will do the last two character from your given string,

314
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,650
let's say I hope Eitan scripting as my string night.

315
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,580
So G is the last character.

316
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,660
I want to get that simply take minus one.

317
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,510
No need to count your index values when a transit output.

318
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,890
We are getting Xeno just by taking minus one.

319
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,320
Okay,

320
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,050
so this is the way how to access particular character from your given strength.

321
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,710
Right?

322
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,650
Let me bring something called my favorite scripting.

323
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:10,650
So I'm giving Jiro toe some fight.

324
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:20,970
So you fight taking this way it will bring you are characters from general to four because

325
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,450
maximum ease Fei Index.

326
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,820
But you are starting from Jiro Ranges five minus 05 letters You are to get those who get

327
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,590
file it us from Jiro.

328
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,670
You are to take the Earth Index forced index second index,

329
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,550
fourth index.

330
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,880
I see.

331
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,350
If I take be white b hedge wool,

332
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,590
Right?

333
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,470
Fine Art is over.

334
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,650
No fight characters that will work.

335
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,520
So what is the range between fired fired?

336
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,730
05 minus zero fight characters you're getting starting from index zero.

337
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,550
That means you will get up to fourth index value.

338
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,400
See,

339
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,930
that would put Suppose if I want to get 15 next as well.

340
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,920
You have to take six because,

341
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,280
dear,

342
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,760
up to six or seven characters.

343
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,300
But you're to get only six during the six minutes Rangers six,

344
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,850
you're getting six character snow,

345
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,460
right?

346
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,810
If I take simply Jiro and then Colon,

347
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,850
then the meaning for the days get from job to last a very character.

348
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,150
Not Okay.

349
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,960
So that's what the what?

350
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,460
The operation.

351
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,680
You are performing index operations,

352
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,080
right?

353
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,700
These are also called as slicing off your given strength slicing operation on these

354
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,830
operations are not going to modify your adjusting right only while printing You're getting

355
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,280
something.

356
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,650
If you want to store this into some other variable,

357
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,350
let's say given string from supposed 0 to 14 decks,

358
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:55,000
then my favorite scripting Then from that juror toe Pfeiffer take then only will get gelato

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,450
for.

360
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:04,050
Then you can print that you are given string general before you don't put.

361
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,050
Not so.

362
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,750
Okay,

363
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,340
fine.

364
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,940
So these the way how you can access your strings based on index values You have one more

365
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,230
thing.

366
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,750
Let me tell you that bring you were string.

367
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,840
I am not giving starting,

368
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,450
but I I'm giving suppose ending index eight.

369
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,440
Or let's say,

370
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,150
simply fight so they will be clear.

371
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,250
See the output.

372
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,290
So gelato 14 decks.

373
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,900
Five minutes ending five minutes before that index.

374
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,750
It will your value.

375
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,200
Not only that,

376
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,560
I want to print up with some fourth index to some 10th index values characters.

377
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,460
So 4 to 10 ranging six.

378
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:54,150
Not only they can take 11 also ranges seven so you will get 45678 Mine then.

379
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,230
So by 10 thing,

380
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,820
legs were getting seven characters.

381
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,460
That's why it will your toe for toe 10 only.

382
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,030
If you mention 11 it will go up to 10 in next.

383
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,550
Characters see the output.

384
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,050
Right,

385
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,930
Fine.

386
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,850
So there's gold slicing off history.

387
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:20,200
So how do you change your diligence string So days strings are basically immutable.

388
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,140
That means once if you define Iwas string,

389
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,850
you cannot change the part off your strength.

390
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,900
But you can complete it,

391
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,220
delete it or you can completely assigned new string.

392
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:39,350
For that I mean suppose Let's say if I tried to modify generating next disease means foster

393
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,690
character,

394
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:39,950
right?

395
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,680
With some other thing.

396
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,570
Let's say in See you're getting another record string object does not support item

397
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,260
assignment.

398
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:56,140
So you cannot modify part off your string like our Let me pray with the daily.

399
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,380
You don't delete option is there,

400
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,680
right?

401
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,660
We had it under discussion on this 25 Sundays.

402
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,050
String officer does not support item relation,

403
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,050
so you cannot delete part off your string.

404
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,910
But entirely young tasting.

405
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,160
You can delegate see that you're not getting any output.

406
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,880
I mean,

407
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,450
Eleanor put because you are the living completely at the same time you can,

408
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,050
Billy.

409
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,790
Oh,

410
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,350
you can assign completely new thing for this.

411
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,350
That's it.

412
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,630
No,

413
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,380
there is no other.

414
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,290
No offer this.

415
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,700
If you print there was strain.

416
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,900
Your string is nothing.

417
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,550
Fight on tutorials,

418
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,400
right?

419
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,890
So there's you cannot delete the part offspring Orica.

420
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,760
You cannot assign particular character in your given string with the new value.

421
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,970
Right?

422
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,550
But you can completely change or delete dio string.

423
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,480
The next one is how to find lent off history.

424
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,420
So nothing is that there is a pre defined function called Len.

425
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,560
Let me find my string length as a one variable my string length as one new variable I'm

426
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,070
taking,

427
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,260
and I'm finding length off your favorite stripping,

428
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,700
right?

429
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,160
See that?

430
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:19,790
No imprinting length off given string is so where you're storing your length.

431
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,350
India variable called my string land right?

432
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:30,550
Let me observe Output Runner of the 16 year getting barbarically you can print no need to

433
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,100
store until you are ah,

434
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,620
lending to some other variable.

435
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:40,410
Let's say length off a given string ease even on a direct this message.

436
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:40,760
Also,

437
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,690
it is your wish.

438
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,700
So in square,

439
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,720
but cuddly brain says right?

440
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,550
Just a light lento function off you were given variable.

441
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:57,760
That's a no gays lend Means How many characters are there any given stream?

442
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
No.

443
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,260
If you have a 16 characters in a given string,

444
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,300
right,

445
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,970
there is some string anyhow,

446
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,010
16 characters,

447
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,860
any given string,

448
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,970
then your index value start from 0 to 15 yard.

449
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,790
To remember this,

450
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,710
it will be helpful for your online exams.

451
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,580
Genital 15 Joe come from Joe,

452
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:25,370
then by 15 year getting 16 characters these positive elfin next values negative way from

453
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,710
minus one to minus 16 if its lending 16 they night away.

454
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:29,940
Next,

455
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,350
valets are from minus one to minus 16.

456
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,180
Like No,

457
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,450
let me print simply your favorite scripting off a minus one.

458
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,930
So we modified somewhere our string to fight on two durians.

459
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,630
Last batteries?

460
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,140
Yes.

461
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,660
So directly I can get that.

462
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,580
Yes,

463
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,470
I am getting our because length is 15 16.

464
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,300
Then lost the character index in terms off.

465
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,050
Pause to east 15.

466
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,760
See that you're getting lost or parties Es only right.

467
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,160
Fine on one more thing days.

468
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,720
Let me go in this way.

469
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,780
I want to print from minus 16.

470
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,160
Too minus fight.

471
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,620
See the airport minus 16 minutes.

472
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,330
Force to character.

473
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,190
Right in dumps off.

474
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,910
Negative because lengthy.

475
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,230
16 Jiro is by default foster character.

476
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,560
Or,

477
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,500
if you know the length,

478
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,840
plenty 16 here,

479
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:33,180
then minus length is the foster character in your given strength like No if I tried toe

480
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,760
print minus phi too minus 16.

481
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,350
See the output?

482
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:46,320
You won't get anything because starting values always lower value minus y is not lower than

483
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,940
minus 16.

484
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,100
Minus Phi is for for greater than minus 16.

485
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,260
Right?

486
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,120
So that's why you have to take always starting with low,

487
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,850
low in next value and you can get the best on your record index.

488
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,660
See if I didn't dump self pause to it is very clear for you.

489
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,750
My favorite.

490
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,590
Skipping someone Let me take four is the lowest value.

491
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm starting with four,

492
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,570
and I want to get up to support some gold index.

493
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,950
That farm instinct starting.

494
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,170
See that?

495
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,010
Put what you're getting.

496
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,450
You're getting somewhat put.

497
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,890
Space is also one of the character for that.

498
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,080
Also,

499
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:25,620
you have some in exposition like find these away how you can find the length and we can

500
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,590
access or how you can delegate strength.

501
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,550
Then finally,

502
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,850
you're going to see how to add or can coordinate two strings.

503
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,420
Nothing is that Let me come in.

504
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,900
Whatever the Cortijo as off?

505
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,260
No.

506
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,680
So I'm going to come in Maine,

507
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,260
so I don't want to exclude this core.

508
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,450
Fine.

509
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,950
Let me take my string equals to suppose some fight on.

510
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,280
I mean,

511
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,890
let me take this as a my string one.

512
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,260
You can take any variable name that I'm taking My string two equals to some scripting.

513
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,580
No,

514
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,810
I want to add this to actually anybody for writing strings.

515
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,480
You ought to say concurred.

516
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,620
Nick concurred in their pull strings instead of firing It is a better word to use

517
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,550
Concarneau Nation concurred in it those things.

518
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,700
So I'm going to add these two and I'm going to create a new string called My String Trees.

519
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,760
Because toe my string one places the symbol toe can coordinate R two r two strings.

520
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,270
Then I am printing.

521
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:36,630
You were third string Whatever you how observed output while you're getting okay somewhere

522
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,710
we are using my strength.

523
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,320
Reword is line number 60 0 still,

524
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,450
we have some mines here.

525
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:52,350
I was the one thing I really find here.

526
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,000
And then it's fine.

527
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,430
See,

528
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,850
the airport body are getting You are getting fight on scripting.

529
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,050
But there is no space between these two words,

530
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,550
right?

531
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,390
So if you want fired space between these two words,

532
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,670
you can add some space.

533
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,910
At the end of forces string are the starting off second string.

534
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,370
But that is not a good way because already some where you defend your strings only what?

535
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:14,700
Harding,

536
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,250
You should not disturb your existing strings,

537
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:16,550
right?

538
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,330
So nothing is there.

539
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,350
Between these two strings are the one most ring.

540
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,890
That thing is pestering that we dig one more string called My string with some space equals

541
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:34,370
two empty string Right now you can Are that my string with the space,

542
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,450
then place.

543
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,450
See that put Now you're getting this piece?

544
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,960
No,

545
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,480
actually,

546
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,220
your intent is We're adding a space between these two strings.

547
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,700
For that,

548
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:43,910
you know,

549
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,760
knitter defining news thing instead of dirt.

550
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:53,350
Dramatically way larding your strings You can add in this way Let me take my string.

551
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,640
Three equals toe my string one place some space.

552
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,380
No spaces.

553
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,660
Also,

554
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,020
sting definitely cannot in this way also goingto defined for that one new string variable.

555
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,180
And no need to include that in your operation.

556
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,890
See,

557
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:13,660
that would know you're getting this space so likewise you conard any number of strings.

558
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,450
Let's say I'm going to add one.

559
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,160
One more string by giving a space.

560
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,120
And then why don skipping tutorials?

561
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,290
So the charity I can are two variables are variables with some strings.

562
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,660
Right?

563
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,180
So by this example,

564
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,260
you should be good with how to add two strings variables to string variables.

565
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,660
Our instinct variables with directly a string.

566
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,660
So these two are string variables on this is space.

567
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,520
This is space on the tutorials automatically strings.

568
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,260
You're using the inside of your operation.

569
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,350
Right?

570
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,500
Fine.

571
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,680
So they These are the minimum basics off your strings.

572
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,460
So we will see in the next video how to work effectively with your strings and add wants

573
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,450
level operations off your sprints.

574
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,450
Okay.

575
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,160
What?

576
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,850
