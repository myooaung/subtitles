00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
hi,

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.940
friends here.

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.150
We're going to write one simple python script.

4
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.030
The purpose off your python script.

5
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.840
Please find all the files which are wilder than X days.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.890
Just a gender.

7
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.050
Do you have a small requirement in your real time?

8
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.170
That is every day.

9
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.900
You want to run one strip to remove the files which are wilder than 30 days or 90 days on

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.630
100 days.

11
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.180
What about it?

12
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:33.020
Maybe so manually to identify your files which are having ah is off 100 days or 90 days.

13
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.940
Based on your requirement,

14
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.820
you can night one simple python scripts that is that you can identify anything.

15
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.450
You can remove it.

16
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.550
So here I am going to write only to identify you.

17
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450
Just try to extend the script to remove the identified Feiss.

18
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.350
Right?

19
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.540
So let me weapon my terminal for timing.

20
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.940
I'm going to open it line external.

21
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.920
So I get up.

22
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.260
I mean,

23
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.830
offer implementing the skip,

24
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.140
saying,

25
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.950
Screw you can go on a run on your windows systems as well.

26
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.490
Let me die.

27
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.650
Day scoop.

28
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.250
So that's groupies.

29
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.360
They'll delete,

30
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.810
actually,

31
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.080
but I'm not going to accomplish strip daily older than X days.

32
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.830
We just tried to enhance this script.

33
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.550
Okay?

34
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.780
First thing I need to read a part.

35
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.820
Right?

36
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.510
So required part.

37
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.450
I'm going to read.

38
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450
So input.

39
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.650
Enter your pop.

40
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.150
See you guys off the reading your part that part may be valid part are invalid part.

41
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.830
That's my first time taking whether it is existing on your host or more if ways dot part

42
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.950
dot exist.

43
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.440
See these operations we explained here,

44
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.850
right?

45
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.300
If you go here somewhere,

46
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.880
we have ways.

47
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.190
More deal,

48
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.480
right?

49
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.710
So anyways,

50
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.050
that part model we explained this operations you just to go back.

51
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.350
And I do recollect your concepts on ways that park,

52
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.450
then required pot.

53
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.530
If it is not existing right,

54
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.570
then simply print.

55
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.250
Please provide valid part.

56
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.490
That's it.

57
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.230
So if part is not valid,

58
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.370
I don't want to run my skip.

59
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.310
I want to stop it.

60
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.050
That's why I'm using sister or exit.

61
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.850
Even though you have remaining logic supports as off.

62
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.960
No,

63
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.810
we are not writing.

64
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.710
We will write it if parties invalid.

65
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.970
Why should we run our logic?

66
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.300
I need to stop my script.

67
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.810
That's why I'm using Sister Dixie.

68
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.450
So because of some reason,

69
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.160
you're exiting.

70
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.190
So I want to exit with another court off one.

71
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.650
But you can provide any other core based on your requirement,

72
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.150
right?

73
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.640
That No,

74
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.020
if path is there.

75
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.580
But if that part is a file,

76
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.020
then we can't find anything inside of a file,

77
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.290
right?

78
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.730
I mean,

79
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.420
in that location of them that file.

80
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.590
That's why if it is a part again,

81
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.990
I don't know,

82
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.860
under on my script.

83
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.850
So where's that part is fine.

84
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.610
The given part.

85
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.850
If it is for file,

86
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.750
then I want to enter the information like please,

87
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.750
Pro Wade.

88
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.050
There are three parts.

89
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.000
That's it.

90
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.060
Then again,

91
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.910
I want to exit.

92
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.590
Now I'm exiting because off.

93
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.850
Other reason I'm exiting with the record too.

94
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.030
So if these two if conditions are false and what is the meaning?

95
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.420
Yes,

96
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.250
you're the user is giving a valid directory part night.

97
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.640
So before going to implement our logic,

98
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.450
our logic is identified The files which are suppose water than some 100 days.

99
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.750
So for time being,

100
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
because here I run now files which are world of the 100 or something like that Let me take

101
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.290
ish is some theories on one more thing.

102
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.390
Here we are using waste earned six model.

103
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.450
That's why when it important that toys and then six model.

104
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.360
Right.

105
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.950
Fine.

106
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.000
Not before going to identify Oliver files based January age.

107
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.390
First of all,

108
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.630
I need to find out what are The files are there,

109
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.450
and I just aren't there in the given location,

110
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.400
right?

111
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.550
That's why what I'm doing is see here,

112
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.780
bring,

113
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.870
you know,

114
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.150
from your waist door to list of that tree.

115
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.510
If you provide your part for that operation,

116
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.530
it is going to list all your their address on file,

117
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.010
which are there in the location.

118
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.550
Right?

119
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.660
So let me take this as a part on.

120
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.950
I'm going to run our skip using Python three.

121
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.780
First of all,

122
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.230
I'll probably invalid part some home,

123
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.950
some something.

124
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.750
See that woman?

125
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.140
Maybe.

126
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.350
What we did let me open our script.

127
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.650
If yeah.

128
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.140
If not if it is there.

129
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.690
No problem.

130
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.520
If it is not there,

131
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.820
right,

132
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.050
I forgot to are not.

133
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.200
If this part is not existing,

134
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.730
then only I want exit from here.

135
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.690
Otherwise see,

136
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.380
because off that you're getting another here.

137
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.310
If what is not there,

138
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.150
you can't list.

139
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.080
That's why you've party is not there.

140
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.340
I will.

141
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.660
I don't want to run my coat.

142
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.080
I want to stop now.

143
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.850
It will work.

144
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.820
So what is the part?

145
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.350
Let me take something round number.

146
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.950
He is not a valid apart.

147
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.600
Right?

148
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.050
So see,

149
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.540
there is a please provide about it,

150
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.080
but Okay,

151
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.940
I'm going to provide valid part.

152
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.950
Let me take Ah,

153
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.980
no,

154
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.780
I'm going to run and I'm going to probably valued part,

155
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.420
my dear.

156
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.250
I'm going to provide file part.

157
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.870
Let's say my ways.

158
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.550
That is a file.

159
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.990
See that Please provide dietary parties asking Yes,

160
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.880
let me read on.

161
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.820
And I'm going to provide directory part.

162
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.290
No.

163
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.950
If you provide a validate report,

164
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.030
it is going to list all your files and authorities,

165
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.520
which are there in a given location.

166
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.080
But our intention,

167
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.810
he just weren't.

168
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.620
If I only files right now what?

169
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.080
How to do?

170
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.130
Whatever the list off their design files,

171
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.060
which you are getting from your given part,

172
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.950
I need to filter them only files I want to collect.

173
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.290
Right?

174
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.250
See how you can collect only fights.

175
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.380
First of all,

176
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.990
try to take one by one file from your list off files and charities.

177
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.840
You know you can use for Luke to take one by one,

178
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.130
right?

179
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.250
For each file in this list off values.

180
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.590
First off a lion printing each file.

181
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.150
See that first you are able to get one by one or not.

182
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.310
Let me take this.

183
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.290
Has a pot.

184
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.940
Now,

185
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.000
instead of getting as a list,

186
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.040
you're going to get one by one.

187
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.520
Yes,

188
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.710
on If you have just somewhere this ex wagered earn somewhere One more thing Narendra,

189
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.950
These two or directories I don't want display them.

190
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.820
Don't try to write a logic before printing.

191
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.720
Yeah,

192
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.230
One more thing,

193
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.650
guys.

194
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.870
Whenever.

195
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.500
If you're working with the files,

196
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.890
right,

197
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.810
try to create force a complete part,

198
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.430
right?

199
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.300
So I'm going to create complete part for my very file each file part time,

200
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.270
including always dark part dot Join.

201
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.900
See,

202
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.620
Complete part is nothing but given part.

203
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.950
Then you are required to file,

204
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.410
right?

205
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.390
Complete part.

206
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.840
I mean,

207
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.630
given part.

208
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.290
And then this one night.

209
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.750
Now I'm going to print your each file,

210
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.450
underscore part right.

211
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.550
See the result,

212
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.000
trust,

213
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.350
But under state,

214
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.750
I don't see the output.

215
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.720
So you're getting all ah,

216
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.100
for all each and every file.

217
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.000
Complete part?

218
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.090
No.

219
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.450
I need to evaluate where the party is a file part or that every part,

220
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.640
you know,

221
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.350
you have again If I mean ah,

222
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.650
if was that part that is filed,

223
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.750
then I want to print that.

224
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.960
Otherwise I don't want to print.

225
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.850
I won't skip that.

226
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.270
If ways not part dot is files,

227
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.850
you're given part each.

228
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.950
See that each underscore file on the score,

229
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.430
buck then only want to print.

230
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.320
Otherwise I don't want to.

231
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.750
Prince.

232
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.860
Previously you got some very where?

233
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.490
X rays er than Narendra,

234
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.030
right?

235
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.780
Somewhere.

236
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.260
Now,

237
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.490
if I read on our core,

238
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:04.010
you're not going to get them because you filter only finds your printing see the output nor

239
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.610
very how x rated and not in the right.

240
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.250
Yes.

241
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.950
Now in your hand,

242
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.020
because off your logic,

243
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.450
you are able to identify only the files which are there in a given location.

244
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.450
No next thing when it was created.

245
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.540
So,

246
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:18.780
guys,

247
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.850
if I know the when it was created,

248
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:27.930
if I know that date then from presented eight core estate if I compare you are file

249
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.640
creation date.

250
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.950
If I do subtraction between these two days,

251
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.380
today's date on when your file was created,

252
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.750
I can get the difference.

253
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.290
Like four days on fire days on one month off,

254
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.730
better days.

255
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.050
I mean?

256
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:38.710
Ah,

257
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.610
some 100 is what ordered.

258
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.510
Maybe right.

259
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.860
So foster fall toe,

260
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.850
identify when it was created.

261
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.450
Right?

262
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.460
See,

263
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.950
let me show you one thing.

264
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.310
Just under and your terminal.

265
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:58.860
Import your ways and see the list off operation with ways that part because you're fighting

266
00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.320
the part.

267
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.970
Always Whatever the required things you need on your part.

268
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.370
Always.

269
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.950
They were aware of a little bit ways Dark part somebody we hope.

270
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.970
Right?

271
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.880
See that somebody we held Get access time.

272
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.870
Get creation time on Get mortified time.

273
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.050
But what we need get access time we need,

274
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.950
right?

275
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:23.520
Let me do the one thing Let me take one of the file called this one Know what I'm doing is

276
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.390
let me bring Where's that pod door?

277
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.130
Get creation time,

278
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.350
then you're fighting him.

279
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:36.680
See the output while you're getting You're getting your time in terms off seconds.

280
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.960
No,

281
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.610
you need to convert that in terms,

282
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.120
off date or whatever you want so that you can come back with raised it.

283
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.400
I mean,

284
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.450
you can substrate from today's date so that you can get the difference.

285
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.690
See,

286
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.230
in order previous video just before this video.

287
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.240
Whatever you have the concept daytime model.

288
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.760
Here we discuss one thing.

289
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.950
One operation called Let me import Forster daytime.

290
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.640
If you remember from the time you should take their time operation,

291
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.750
then we hope from times time there is operation.

292
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.710
If you provide the seconds number of seconds with this,

293
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.040
it is ready to do that date for us.

294
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.310
Yes,

295
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.850
it's giving,

296
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.570
right.

297
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:24.450
That's why what I'm doing is that we weapon he was script now,

298
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.190
right under.

299
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:34.050
Then let me import first daytime module import,

300
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.850
daytime model.

301
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.050
Then I am printing your each file.

302
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.330
And also,

303
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.500
I want to print it the file when it was created.

304
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.920
Right?

305
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.370
So here,

306
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.000
as off No,

307
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.450
I have given a fixture part,

308
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.730
but it has to very for each and every file.

309
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.450
That's why this is a variable on your file.

310
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.180
Part is there with the variable called each file part?

311
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.280
No,

312
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.540
along with your file.

313
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.060
I'm also going toe print.

314
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.750
When it was clear Did right,

315
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:09.750
that might take a pot and see that I'm going to give a pop.

316
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:15.350
Maybe each file part.

317
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.790
Coleman.

318
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.750
It's my mistake.

319
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:25.050
See that way out taking this spot?

320
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.010
Yeah.

321
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.850
Up to this.

322
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.320
Only that file,

323
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.620
Potter,

324
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.350
How to provide,

325
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.590
right?

326
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.240
No.

327
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.940
See the result.

328
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.250
You're getting your part along with that You're getting a date.

329
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.450
When it was clear there,

330
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.210
I know what I wonder.

331
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.050
Louise injured off this.

332
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.850
How many days back it was created.

333
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.750
I want to get there.

334
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.190
Then what you are to do with the tourist date You just to subtract this date so that you

335
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.350
get the difference.

336
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.840
So no one I'm doing is I'm going to create a today's date.

337
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.680
Objects somewhere.

338
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.230
Let me create reference.

339
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:03.450
Date are two days equals two daytime door daytime dot No.

340
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.290
Right.

341
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.060
I know.

342
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:12.350
What I'm doing is are the end injured off this information?

343
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.190
I will store this.

344
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:21.570
Each filed a filed creation file creation date as a variable inside that I will store this

345
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.750
entire information draw friending directly here.

346
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.950
Anyone?

347
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.010
What will seem like?

348
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.380
You know what I'm doing is I'm going to need all those things,

349
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.150
your file,

350
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:38.480
and then just victory or to the date I'm subtracting from your to date.

351
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.880
Each file creation did file creation date,

352
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.050
right?

353
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.650
Fine.

354
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.250
No seed output First,

355
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.930
if anything goes wrong,

356
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.050
will verify that.

357
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.180
Yes,

358
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.240
your file.

359
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:03.580
And it was getting one day before with two hours fight is with four hours one day back with

360
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.080
two hours.

361
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.410
I mean,

362
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.910
one day tours back,

363
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.270
right?

364
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.790
But I don't bother about this.

365
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.950
Howard's I wanted only exactly this,

366
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:10.850
right?

367
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.590
No.

368
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.920
See,

369
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.160
what I'm going to do because this is object,

370
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.870
right?

371
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.090
You can also bring instead of complete thing,

372
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.200
you can print only days operation anywhere.

373
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.510
A difference off your two dates,

Huh?

383
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.450
What are the operations are there with your days,

384
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.430

It has no are people deaths.

386
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.110
What is the problem with that?

387
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.950
Let me check it.

388
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.690
File creation.

389
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.010
Yeah.

390
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.390
Sorry.

391
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.850
This entire thing is the object right today.

392
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.140
So on this entire thing,

393
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.050
we need to perform it.

394
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.750
Not right.

395
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.160
You may get Don't.

396
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.490
How can you get that?

397
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.590
Today's operatives there on that are not nothing,

399
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.850
Guys simply bring d a r off you were difference.

400
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.550
So whatever the operations are there on each and every object,

401
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:24.320
the only clue point these DEA let me run on board some part and see the results.

402
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.610
So for each and every difference there is operation called Dark Days that maximum value

403
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.630
didn't microseconds Minimum reserves in seconds total Second,

404
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.330
something like that.

405
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.450
So now I am taking days operation on your difference between two days difference.

406
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:38.710
Right?

407
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:45.100

411
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.810
Sorry part.

412
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.050
You can provide any part but I'm taking this as an example Pot.

413
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.180
See there one day,

414
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.790

419
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.860

The files which are having is more than three days.

421
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.890
Those files only I want to print.

422
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.290

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.660
If it is greater than you were age we fixed somewhere.

431
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.350
Just Reno.

432
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.860
Always there looking at your value.

434
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:52.850
I want to print it.

435
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.450
But observe this information.

436
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:55.630

You're not getting like this while it is one day five Now we're not getting that.

441
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:17.100
So now you are able to collect You are all the files which are having is greater than some

442
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.650
exodus In our example case there is greater than three days.

443
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.050
Right?

444
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.450
This you have one more step just to remove this thing.

445
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.850
That operation is also there again with the world.

446
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:34.050
