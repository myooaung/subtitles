00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
reference here.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.660
We're going to learn some of the string operations there,

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.930
like,

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.320
you know,

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.350
case conversion.

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.470
I mean,

7
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.420
lower to upper,

8
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.910
upper to lower any string into title.

9
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.540
Former are making capitalize something like that.

10
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.160
Okay,

11
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.540
let me weapon my someone takes or you don't.

12
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.170
So there's here.

13
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.700
I'm going to you.

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.630
You can use anything.

15
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.990
OK,

16
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.230
but I'm using sublime texture.

17
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.780
The Viet let me first to give you a name for that by pressing simply control s So let's

18
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840
stop then.

19
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.110
Under our territory.

20
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.670
Let me create a case conversion operations on strings.

21
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.750
Not the way that's it.

22
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.650
Right,

23
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.610
You guys,

24
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.670
I'm going to defend a string.

25
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.700
Call my string.

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.590
You can take anything.

27
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.550
Okay?

28
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.250
I'm going to write something like fight on scripting.

29
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.900
Okay?

30
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.760
No,

31
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.950
let me bring the first.

32
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.950
I was string badly.

33
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.960
Whatever you have,

34
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.530
see the output.

35
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.120
Yes,

36
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.410
You are getting no ways.

37
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.510
I want to convert my entire string in the lower kiss.

38
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.950
Nothing is there simply dot Lower operation on your string,

39
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.750
not lower oppression.

40
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.800
What?

41
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.350
I want to convert my entire string into upper case letters.

42
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.350
See the output on After performing these two operations,

43
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.450
I want to bring to my string as well See the output.

44
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.220
So here you have to understand one thing.

45
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.510
Whatever the operations you're performing on,

46
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.500
it was streamed with the dot right?

47
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.150
They don't modify.

48
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.650
You were a virginal string that way because off start prince treatment you're getting your

49
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.960
or dancing by conscripting with PNDs only capital even though in second line your

50
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.790
performing your string dot lower on third line by your performing upper they don't Marty

51
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.100
for you.

52
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.250
What orginal spring.

53
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.700
That's why strings are called immutable Once.

54
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.870
If you define your strength,

55
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.320
you cannot change the part off your strength.

56
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.500
Only we know that.

57
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.090
How did we have seen that,

58
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.750
right,

59
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.250
Fine,

60
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.640
I suppose If you want to capture after performing the lower case letter or upper performing

61
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.250
urine testing in the upper,

62
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.890
you can start this operation result into some very well let's say my string in lower case

63
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.380
only lower any available you can take.

64
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.390
But I'm taking this one.

65
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.150
That's it.

66
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.900
Right now in judo printing my sting God,

67
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.150
lower case already We're done on your variable.

68
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.910
We perform lower operation and we store the result into this variable not print this

69
00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.300
variable and see the airport let me come in these two lines and after your own put you

70
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.540
already.

71
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.050
We heard him,

72
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.270
right.

73
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.660
See the airport?

74
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.650
That's it.

75
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.190
Right?

76
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.490
So there's as off.

77
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.690
No,

78
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.650
we have seen lower and upper operations on your given string.

79
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.850
But how?

80
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.770
You know,

81
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.880
how many operations are there any given strain?

82
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.730
Like See,

83
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.250
let me simply weapon my common line and let me enter into my potential.

84
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.090
Simply defined any variable called any string.

85
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.020
I'm simply run.

86
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.900
Bring the a year off your X variable.

87
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.140
So the air is the helping world for us to list out all the operations which are available

88
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.280
on your given strength because you're Exodus String because you can randomly assigned some

89
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.860
string to some variable X or any variable on on that variable.

90
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.300
If you perform simply D a r off eggs,

91
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.700
it will do the available operations on your given string.

92
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.920
There are so many,

93
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.240
right?

94
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.550
So I will go with step by step.

95
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:06.020
So now we have seen this is upper operation on some very whole lower operation here.

96
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.150
Your lower operation.

97
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.850
No,

98
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.720
you're something called Swept Case Ideal.

99
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.750
Capitalize.

100
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.220
Let me go with the slap case.

101
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.550
Right.

102
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.630
This trap case is nothing but directly.

103
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.020
I'm going to print your result.

104
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.630
He was string dot Simply swap case CEO After the last,

105
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.750
I would put what you're getting lower case and upper upper case into lower.

106
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.650
That's it.

107
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.660
But once I can't remember that whatever you are performing daughter operation that is not

108
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.170
going to disturb your original strain only while printing it is modifying.

109
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.880
So if you want to capture for swap kiss reserved,

110
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.650
you can store this result into some variable like your second line.

111
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.090
Right?

112
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.030
So this is what guests No guys,

113
00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:01.080
I want to bring my string in terms off cap title Former So title is nothing Back printing

114
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.250
each and every letter off a word.

115
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.050
Starting letter off each and every word in terms off capital.

116
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:15.550
So already we hold year capitalist led Mary This is small letters by Dan Skipping tutorials

117
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.550
.

118
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.480
No,

119
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.680
you fire under script and see the output for last print statement.

120
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.130
You're getting P Capital s capital t capital because you are converting your given string

121
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.700
into title.

122
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.440
Former fighting for money is nothing Bird each on nobody's each in each and every word.

123
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.440
The starting letters should be capital.

124
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.450
That's what we are doing with the help off title.

125
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.550
Right?

126
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.060
Then capitalize.

127
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.980
Let me give you Let me take one more string called my new string You can take anything I'm

128
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:55.210
taking Simplest Moeller despite on scripting So that is I want boot Make my string in terms

129
00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.460
off Capitalize Former right See,

130
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.410
capitalize for money is nothing But after the old political understand only the starting a

131
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.650
letter in a given string You are making it as it.

132
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.590
Yeah,

133
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.610
but that's a that is the former off calculate,

134
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.010
right,

135
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.070
Capitalize Fine.

136
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.390
So,

137
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.610
guys,

138
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.750
these are the some of the operations on your given strings to convert one case toe Other

139
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.150
case or swept case are ideal or capitalize.

140
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.580
Right?

141
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.520
So there isn't enough for you were,

142
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.930
you know,

143
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.530
lower.

144
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.450
You can also perform one more operation called I will do one thing only for lower or upper

145
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.450
.

146
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.900
You don't know whether given Sting is there in lower case r Berkus.

147
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.020
But the thing is,

148
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.450
you want a gun work?

149
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.380
You were enticed ring like swept kiss.

150
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.180
Let me do one thing Case of fold Bring.

151
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:08.210
You are new string dot case fall another that would put what you're getting My new sting.

152
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.330
Yeah,

153
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.250
I Commander the right.

154
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.200
Let me enable this my new string where it is.

155
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.450
Yeah,

156
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.440
Instead of my news thing,

157
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.220
I would want my string variable.

158
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.400
Anything you cannot play on any string.

159
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.650
Right?

160
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.130
Abdel?

161
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.550
Output.

162
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.150
Right.

163
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.410
So you are converting your enticing even the late Monday here.

164
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.350
Capitalists,

165
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.360
Something called G.

166
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.070
Any ending the modification?

167
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.050
See the output?

168
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.710
What you're getting right.

169
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.510
You're getting all in terms off.

170
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.850
Lower case.

171
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.750
Fine.

172
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.170
So injured off lower operation.

173
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.010
You can also perform.

174
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.050
Case fooled.

175
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.350
Right,

176
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.250
Fine.

177
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.410
So there's these.

178
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:03.450
Are these some of the operations to convert the world strings from one case to other case?

179
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.850
Right.

180
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.290
Okay.

181
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.800
Okay,

182
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.070
guys,

183
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.030
Thank you for watching this,

184
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.370
will you?
