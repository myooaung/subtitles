1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,550
friends here we're going to discuss about Scoop off the variables for your functions.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,840
So before starting with the scope off the variables,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,650
let me show you how to call a function from another function.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,050
So our taken a script name as scope off the variables.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,450
Right?

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,170
Fine.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,960
Now what I'm doing is I'm going to defend a function.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,540
Let's say simply,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,850
I'm calling my function one.

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,350
You can take any function names based on the word rules.

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,050
Let's say I want to display.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:42,090
Welcome to functions,

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,950
right.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,670
So,

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,180
Ardian,

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,310
just try to write.

17
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,790
Returned?

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,350
None.

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,290
That's it.

20
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,460
No,

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,910
I'm going to defend one more function.

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:01:01,450
My function to thank you then.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,680
Yet right return.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,950
Now that's it.

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,230
No,

26
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,550
you have to functions in your core.

27
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,750
So to execute,

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,840
get the output from your functions.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,070
What we have to do is going to call them right support.

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,250
I'm going to call my function one.

31
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,790
So there's a way how we can call your functions,

32
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,050
right?

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,650
See that you're getting your or pull from first of function.

34
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,560
Now,

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,140
if you want to exclude you around court,

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,790
which is there in second function as well,

37
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,150
What we have to do is we can call your second function.

38
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,750
That's it.

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,550
But sometimes we're going forward.

40
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,970
While writing real time scripts,

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,350
you may need to call your function from inside off another function.

42
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,440
Yes,

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,550
you can call it Let's say I want to call my function to From My function one.

44
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,850
So I'm calling from my function.

45
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,100
That's a everything you don't put.

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,400
Thank you,

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,610
right,

48
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,870
So from function one I'm calling function to Yes,

49
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:16,050
you can call any function from any place like fine know what I'm doing is,

50
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,560
and one more thing is if he observed,

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,430
Now these function is in your main court,

52
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,710
right?

53
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,050
If you observe,

54
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,350
it is in outside off your function.

55
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,270
But where you going?

56
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,730
Forward?

57
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,810
New Real time Night mags Own cases We won't right any logic outside of a function h and

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,100
everything even support.

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,220
Sometimes if you have a single line will buy to write that line in terms off a function

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,450
that's a good practice,

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,600
right?

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,550
That's fine.

63
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,150
Now see that what I'm doing is I'm writing some X equal student,

64
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,670
and I want to print that X value from your function.

65
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:58,950
One.

66
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:08,910
Let's say x value from function one just I'm trying to print X value at the same time.

67
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:17,270
Let me print to the X value X value from function to yes.

68
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,320
No.

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,720
Let me run.

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,290
You can see that.

71
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:19,550
Put.

72
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,050
You're getting your report,

73
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,350
right?

74
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,510
No,

75
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,790
I'm commending this.

76
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:34,480
I in function one I'm defining X equals to tell not only 10 we can take anywhere.

77
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,680
Look,

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,650
let's say 16.

79
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,570
No,

80
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:37,740
see,

81
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,320
that is a after the output from your function one,

82
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,050
you're getting value as 60.

83
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,960
But while excluding from function to you're getting a little called name X is not defined.

84
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:58,260
So this is called scope off the variables means if any variable is defined inside off a

85
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,610
function by default,

86
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:07,610
that variable is specific toe that functionally you can't access that variable outside off

87
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,450
that function.

88
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,850
So I define Mexico 60 year and I'm tryingto display X value from your second function.

89
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,150
It won't work.

90
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,350
It is specific to dysfunction or this is a local variable for this function.

91
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,460
But if you're door previously,

92
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,450
we did this one bite.

93
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,770
Let's say first,

94
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,530
let me come in this whenever.

95
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,570
If any variable is defined outside off a function that variable,

96
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,980
you can able to access from function one and function to that means if any variable is

97
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,310
define outside off the functions,

98
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,770
then that is global variable.

99
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,790
So,

100
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,600
by default,

101
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,220
if you define any wearable outside off their functions,

102
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,460
see nowhere we have here.

103
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,870
We don't have any function here,

104
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,150
right?

105
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,580
We're calling,

106
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,910
but exceeds coastal town in the main court is not under any function.

107
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,980
Then this excess,

108
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,800
by default global variable global variable means you can access that variable anywhere

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,250
inside off your function inside off your script,

110
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,190
right?

111
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,660
No,

112
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,450
what we are doing,

113
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,770
if any available is define inside off a function,

114
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,250
then that variable is specific to your function only.

115
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,350
Like now we have two nights off variables local and global variables,

116
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,700
right?

117
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,650
First thing scope means there's the meaning for your scope off the variable.

118
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,800
So based on this is scope,

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,950
we have local and global variables.

120
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,690
Now I can say this is a global variable,

121
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:49,710
and now all if I enable this,

122
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,250
let's say this is local.

123
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,260
No,

124
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:56,790
I'm running.

125
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,420
See the result?

126
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,970
What you're getting So in Maine,

127
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,040
coloured taken X equals 10 on my function.

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,450
One I'm defining X equals 60.

129
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,890
No,

130
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,860
whenever If you take same variables in the main cold and in the function they're not seem.

131
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,150
Now This X is different and the sex is different.

132
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,790
That's why while excluding from my function one what is the result?

133
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,050
We are getting 60 value because you define 60 here,

134
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,200
but from function to you don't have any X variable here.

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,150
Then what your python will do means is there any global variable lunatics?

136
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,250
Then we'll try to bring that X.

137
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,660
But before that,

138
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,450
in case if you how local variable No,

139
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,600
see,

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,910
that is,

141
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,150
er you're getting 40.

142
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,270
So your function,

143
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,650
will you your fight on will you priority for your local variables inside off your function

144
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:57,450
while trying to display your X variable value If X is not defined inside off your function

145
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:57,450
,

146
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:57,880
I mean,

147
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,520
if no local variable X,

148
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,940
then what your pattern will do means it will try to find Is there any X as a global

149
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,350
variable?

150
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,460
If it is there,

151
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,530
you will try to print that variable value If it is not their dental toe and ever see that?

152
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:13,770
No,

153
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,380
I'm commenting,

154
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,690
executes returning your main course.

155
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,220
No,

156
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,950
they're getting enough.

157
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,480
That's it.

158
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:30,450
So they simply scope off the variables like and last one let me explain that.

159
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,530
No,

160
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,410
we're going forward,

161
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:32,690
right?

162
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,150
We're going to write each and everything in terms off functions only.

163
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,040
No,

164
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:46,750
What I will do is you can take any function not only mean,

165
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,370
but if you take main than somewhat meaningful,

166
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:50,760
that's it.

167
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,530
Main means will Court will start from this place.

168
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:53,910
That's it.

169
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,950
Other than that,

170
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,850
nothing is there defining X equals,

171
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,710
pretend and calling my function one.

172
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,050
I'm also taking us it under one function.

173
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,130
Right now you fight.

174
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:06,700
Run these.

175
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,840
There is no or put because you define three functions on No.

176
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,830
Where you're calling the execution point from where you want to start your core Whether we

177
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,300
want to start from function to our function one are from main function from which place you

178
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,210
want to exclude your core as off No,

179
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,490
right.

180
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,050
I'm feeling that this is my main course.

181
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,180
I had to start the exclusion from this point.

182
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,650
That's why I need to call this function somewhere.

183
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,720
So no,

184
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,750
I am calling main.

185
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,860
That's a no Whenever If you're tryingto call in this way,

186
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,220
you're getting another core name.

187
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:52,700
X is not defined from your may in which function my function to like?

188
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,450
No,

189
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,700
What I want to believe as as off my field there No exit question is not a global variable,

190
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,980
right?

191
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,550
This is under.

192
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,250
But when did this?

193
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,240
Now this is 100 main function.

194
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,350
Maine is also one function like my function.

195
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:18,850
So instead of many can also take my court starts from here you can take anything but just

196
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,540
were falling.

197
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,170
Now we hard right here injured off me.

198
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,120
You want to write this one?

199
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,550
That's it.

200
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,600
No see,

201
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,790
there is a same thing.

202
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:34,230
So instead of these just generally all are for falling like this main.

203
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,590
That's it.

204
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,270
Minds off this mean right?

205
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,650
Maine is also like one function.

206
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,130
Now if you observe inside off your main exit question is there not?

207
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,640
This is a function right now.

208
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,930
Exit question is local,

209
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,230
local for this main function You corn taxes.

210
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,550
No exit question from outside off you were function main function or any off your functions

211
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,550
.

212
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,750
I define Mexico 60.

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,480
That's way from my my my function.

214
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,130
One I can able to access X equals 60 but in my function.

215
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,860
So I don't have X.

216
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,070
Well,

217
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,710
you Then how can I get it?

218
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,750
That's why you're getting another.

219
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,790
Now,

220
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,980
what are the variable?

221
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,190
Is there in main function?

222
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,220
Exit coaster 10.

223
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,750
That variable value.

224
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:22,760
I want toe access from my function to then hope in case of it is they're here.

225
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,040
Then there is a main function.

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,520
I mean,

227
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,380
in Maine logic.

228
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,960
You know,

229
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,350
you're getting your actually from function to as 10.

230
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,220
But now exit Kristen.

231
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,240
Is that in main function?

232
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,700
But I want to accept this exit question from my function to right then in main function.

233
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,540
I mean,

234
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,590
whatever the function you have in that function yard,

235
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,880
right,

236
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,810
Global X,

237
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,640
that means now exceeds globally can access my ex variable anywhere inside off your bite on

238
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:50,950
strip.

239
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,920
No,

240
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,090
see,

241
00:10:52,090 --> 00:11:00,450
that isn't now you're getting from function group in they fine,

242
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,790
but days.

243
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,050
Making your variable as global is not always good.

244
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,250
Okay,

245
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:15,680
Sometimes you can take it as a were able as global but injured off global.

246
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,750
We have one more way to pass.

247
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,060
You were responding,

248
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,150
were able to your required function,

249
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,760
right?

250
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,590
See that?

251
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,900
Now?

252
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,750
I'm going toe comment from here.

253
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,900
Don't get confused.

254
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,840
Okay,

255
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:29,960
Well,

256
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,710
let's goes this again in next radio as off.

257
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,060
Not just I'm giving the way.

258
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,150
How you can pass.

259
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,500
So you know I'm going to come in this on as off.

260
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:37,870
No.

261
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,650
If I run my core what you're getting from my function one you're getting your value is 60.

262
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,170
No,

263
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,450
I'm not calling anywhere my function to know.

264
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,550
I want to call my function to suppose from main function itself.

265
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,840
No,

266
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,640
I'm calling,

267
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,610
but in main function my function to I don't have any wearable call X.

268
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,690
That's why are getting another.

269
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,980
I don't want to use global in case if I use global yes,

270
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,850
it will work without any other.

271
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:13,360
But I don't want to use the variable as a global but I want to send the value off X value

272
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,350
10 to my function toe.

273
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,270
So other way to pass it were value to your required function is just inside off your

274
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,910
parentheses.

275
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:32,210
Just fight x No here also you have to write six know what will happen 10 value While

276
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:39,680
calling this my function to you are also passing not X You're not passing X the value the

277
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:48,050
value off x 10 10 your posse So the meaning for disease You are not passing X value affects

278
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,950
Then you're passing toe This variable.

279
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,680
Now this X and the sex they're completely different in case if you are.

280
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,150
If you're having a confusion right first,

281
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,110
let Mitt on it and see the result.

282
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,850
Now what I'm doing Injured off Ex Im taking white now I want to print that way.

283
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,470
That's it.

284
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,180
Right.

285
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,360
So out of then global,

286
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,940
how can you if I take global than this variable is a You can access that variable from any

287
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,350
function from any lane anywhere in your pipe from ST.

288
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,470
But I don't want to access in all places only from this function only I want to access this

289
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,490
variable X that value.

290
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,710
Not even that ex.

291
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,900
Only the value of fix then I concerned in this way that's a on one.

292
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,550
More important point is now this variable and this variable are completely different.

293
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,100
The value off X will be assigned a way that value we're printing.

294
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,550
That's it.

295
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,350
Okay,

296
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,640
so now here.

297
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,680
Whenever if you pass,

298
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,250
you were variable to your function than that is called argument.

299
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,340
All right,

300
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,780
here that is called,

301
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,950
but I'll meet that.

302
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,710
Okay,

303
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,000
we'll discuss in detail in the next video aboard this argument and parameter.

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,050
Okay.

305
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,010
Okay,

306
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,280
guys,

307
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,750
Thank you for watching this video.
