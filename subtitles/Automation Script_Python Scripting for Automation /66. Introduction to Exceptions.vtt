ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
friends here.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.390
We're going to discuss a boat exception handling with your fight on.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.970
First of all,

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.350
what is an exception?

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.230
Si,

6
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.810
simply simply Exception is nothing but another on a python program.

7
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.950
Our script terminates as soon as it encounters another.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.730
As you know the house Some 10 or 100 of thousands off lines in your pie Transcript Maybe

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.160
you have somewhere in your court.

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.650
Better if that Aires encountered by your pie tone then you're skipping will stop.

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.350
You're stepping on egg scoot.

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.150
It will permit night.

13
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.770
Let me show you with simple example Let me say with us are working with exceptions,

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.620
not B y No.

15
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.660
There's first off all I'm writing.

16
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.350
Simply see that.

17
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.440
Ah,

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.720
welcome to exceptions.

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.650
Concept find like Madani.

20
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.590
Yes.

21
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.690
You are getting your output right.

22
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.610
I generally have only one line.

23
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.250
Your core noble Let me remove these parents is at the end off your print.

24
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.820
I don't see the results You're getting in other because of that letter You are going to

25
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.250
stop your pie Transcript.

26
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.930
I do not see how one more land.

27
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.360
Then I will do one more thing.

28
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.500
First of all I'm having Oh no,

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.360
it is fine.

30
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.460
let me say with them,

31
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.850
Danny.

32
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.630
Yes?

33
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.150
You are getting two lines off put.

34
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.590
But in the very first line,

35
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.370
what I'm doing is I'm doing a mistake.

36
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.240
No,

37
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.950
you're not getting all put for second line.

38
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.360
See,

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.060
Whitey,

40
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.010
completion off your first lane.

41
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.150
You release a mystic,

42
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.570
right?

43
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.680
Because of that output,

44
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.520
what is also targeting syntax error.

45
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.380
So you have some error somewhere because of that error you are fightin is going to stop

46
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.150
your script,

47
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.550
right?

48
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.810
Fine.

49
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.280
No.

50
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.010
Let me do it.

51
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.130
No,

52
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.540
it's fine.

53
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.670
No,

54
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.080
what I'm doing is bring some four devoured by or four.

55
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.950
Division with two.

56
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.710
Yes.

57
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.610
You're getting results as to guard zero.

58
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.250
That's fine.

59
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.470
No engine off,

60
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.710
um,

61
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.370
baking zero.

62
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.470
No,

63
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.150
see the desert.

64
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.580
I can.

65
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.790
You are also getting an error that raised Jiro Delusion.

66
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.650
A delusion by Jiro.

67
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.580
See,

68
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.090
guys,

69
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.550
you feel comfort in this way.

70
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.240
Let me remove here.

71
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.650
What is our body are getting sing backs that up.

72
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.900
No,

73
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.260
if I don't.

74
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.110
This thing I'm indivisible with the Jiro.

75
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.750
Now you're getting Jiro division at,

76
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.880
uh so previously are getting syntax error.

77
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.050
But now you're getting dearer do Jeanetta.

78
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:18.140
So basically errors are two types in your python and it sort who likes what the are 1st 1

79
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.740
needs syntax.

80
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.550
Hello,

81
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.450
poor syntax errors.

82
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.010
2nd 1 is See,

83
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.470
guys,

84
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.330
If you observe four divided by two,

85
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.610
it's working perfectly.

86
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.410
That means perfect syntax.

87
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.050
Is there?

88
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.560
If I do with Jiro as person tax,

89
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.990
it's correct,

90
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.250
right?

91
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.680
Maybe.

92
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.940
As for your mathematic rule,

93
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.900
it is not possible.

94
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.550
But as puts impacted is correct.

95
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.160
No,

96
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.040
While running,

97
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.260
you're getting an error because off four division with Jiro is not possible.

98
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.590
That means while running you're getting a different type of federal court.

99
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.550
Jiro Division era.

100
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.450
Not this type of others are called run time errors.

101
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.580
The last person back to this correct but well running because you don't have any are

102
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.450
defined value for four by zero,

103
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.220
right?

104
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.330
That's why you're getting another.

105
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.130
That's why this is a runtime error.

106
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.250
And these errors are nothing but exceptions.

107
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.080
So this is exceptional case,

108
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.450
right?

109
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.430
As per mathematic rule before they would be too,

110
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.120
is possible.

111
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.390
Sorry,

112
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.650
41 but do is possible,

113
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.580
but only four there.

114
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.660
But here is not possible.

115
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.450
Some exceptions,

116
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.850
so exceptions are occurring only during one time night.

117
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.650
Fine.

118
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:45.350
See this impact centers you don't have any special rules toe having this index eras,

119
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.830
that means you need to follow the sin taxes exactly.

120
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.100
Well,

121
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.510
writing your Python script.

122
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:59.000
No way to handle syntax at us.

123
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.200
But you can handle exceptions.

124
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.140
You can handle exceptions.

125
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.310
That means See,

126
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.750
as of now,

127
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.880
you're getting supposed 40.

128
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.830
Would be Jiro Some derision era that type of errors you can handle Andi engine off,

129
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.450
terminating your pipe landscape In this way you can permanent with a meaningful information

130
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.450
,

131
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.200
right?

132
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.310
So I will show you that before that there is a way to handle it's important days.

133
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.450
Oh,

134
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.350
handle a run time Errors are exceptions.

135
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.320
Let me show you.

136
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.450
It's simple example.

137
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.450
See,

138
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.630
what I'm doing is not available or syntax just after the airport.

139
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.490
I'm printing simply for division by two.

140
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.270
No,

141
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.500
I'm simply printing.

142
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:05.620
No.

143
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.000
Previously are getting your output in this way.

144
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.030
Some random Mrs you're getting No,

145
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.760
you are not going to get You are going to get.

146
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.850
See that result first.

147
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.480
It's perfect.

148
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.800
Suppose if I do four.

149
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.750
Dejan Jiro.

150
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.950
What is happening?

151
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.590
It is not giving.

152
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.440
Another off course is error,

153
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.250
but we're handling that we're giving with clear information.

154
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.160
Jiro division errors are you know,

155
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.550
division?

156
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.230
No,

157
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.260
it is not like another off course it is there,

158
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.050
but we're handling with careful,

159
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.450
right,

160
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.750
Fine.

161
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.350
So,

162
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.150
first of all,

163
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:47.850
how when When you have to use exception handling in your pipe On script,

164
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.610
I think,

165
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.750
is that it is very simple.

166
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.570
As you know,

167
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.450
do you have a core?

168
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.770
As you know,

169
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.750
you have a court on?

170
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.710
If there is a chance toe,

171
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.110
get any runtime error,

172
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.350
then you have to handle it.

173
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.690
But its simple thing.

174
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.270
One more thing.

175
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.250
Let me do one thing.

176
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.250
I want to open a fight.

177
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.190
I want to open your file core.

178
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.950
Let's say open,

179
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.490
not a dot Txt for real purpose.

180
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.620
That's why default more.

181
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.630
I'm not mentioning that I am closing.

182
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.600
But when this to let me print,

183
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.250
If we're not read,

184
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.710
see,

185
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.250
that would worry.

186
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.620
Are getting file,

187
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.850
not phone error.

188
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.420
Actually,

189
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.130
not in our txt file is existing.

190
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.410
Then you don't have any other as parts.

191
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.790
In fact,

192
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.440
it is correct.

193
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.990
But while running because there is no file,

194
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.110
you're getting another.

195
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.550
That's why this is in front primera.

196
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.750
So here there is a chance.

197
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.930
What is the chance?

198
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.950
Maybe not indarti Active file exist or may not exist,

199
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.090
right?

200
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.580
So that's why you can expect here.

201
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.090
Yes,

202
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.280
there is a chance to get an exception.

203
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.140
That's why you can handle in this way.

204
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.050
What is that?

205
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.590
Try try open your file.

206
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:08.050
Then let me print convent.

207
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:13.560
Then let me close our file.

208
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.950
If really find is there,

209
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.950
this court will exclude otherwise.

210
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.470
Except let me write some.

211
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:22.930
I don't know.

212
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.350
What is that?

213
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:29.800
Let me write some problem while reading the 90 dot txt file.

214
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.250
That's it.

215
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.280
Not admit on it.

216
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.050
Yeah,

217
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.490
I noticed.

218
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:35.780
In back.

219
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.150
Set up.

220
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.950
What is that?

221
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.710
Sendek set up Brain.

222
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.160
Yeah,

223
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.170
it's not for right.

224
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.500
It is the simply your four.

225
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.410
Yeah.

226
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.380
You can't handle syntax errors,

227
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.400
so be careful.

228
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.420
Highlighting your syntax is you can handle only or run time errors that work here.

229
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.360
I'm sure See?

230
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.460
Actually carried out.

231
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.750
The extra file is not there.

232
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.810
If it is there,

233
00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.650
what will happen?

234
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.150
This block will execute.

235
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.850
Then it will simply skip this line.

236
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.770
Simply accept a block.

237
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.450
It will simply skip except a block.

238
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.020
If something goes wrong here,

239
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.800
well running your court then your pattern will stop this part.

240
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.980
And then it will try to exclude the court,

241
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.560
which is there.

242
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.250
Never accept a block.

243
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.010
So it's like a simple thing like infidels.

244
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.920
But you know,

245
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.880
in a fun else what will happen if if condition is false,

246
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.050
then only else will exclude.

247
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.950
But here not like that.

248
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.240
Your partner will try to exclude this block first in this,

249
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.310
maybe at any line.

250
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.050
If something goes wrong,

251
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.700
then your python will stop the execution off this block on immediately.

252
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.180
It will try to exclude the block,

253
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.570
which is there under your except that's a But you know,

254
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.550
what I'm doing is I don't know what is there.

255
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.270
I'm getting us off.

256
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:52.410
No,

257
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:58.700
that's why you can also get what type off you're going to get here except exception.

258
00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.850
What is the exception?

259
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:10.860
As some other e on you can print that Because of this,

260
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.950
enter your stopping Your fighting is going to stop your core.

261
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.150
See that?

262
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.370
No such file or directory,

263
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.550
Cornering or txt.

264
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.650
That's it.

265
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.270
I think this is a file,

266
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.180
not phone error.

267
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.450
If you don't handle with the prior lex up,

268
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:33.520
then see inches off in a smooth way.

269
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.720
You're handling your core if you use,

270
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.410
try and accept.

271
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.400
If you don't use that.

272
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.150
What will happen?

273
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.950
See that?

274
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.290
Simply I'm doing this.

275
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.550
No,

276
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.340
You're getting,

277
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:45.990
like file,

278
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.670
not phone.

279
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.170
No such file order.

280
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.860
Of course,

281
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.810
the air is fine,

282
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.250
but you're not handling properly to run your core.

283
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.710
That's the reason.

284
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.250
Whenever there is a chance to get an exception while learning your core at that time,

285
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.390
please try to use.

286
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.950
Try and accept a block on.

287
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.660
These are simple thing.

288
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.340
Guys pray and accept block.

289
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.280
So let me right How to handle exceptions.

290
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.200
Simple.

291
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.620
It is an interrogation,

292
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.450
guys with the pi earned except the block.

293
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.250
That's it.

294
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.630
Right.

295
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.150
Then what is this index for that?

296
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.050
Very simple.

297
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.320
All right.

298
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.060
What?

299
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.260
I would,

300
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:33.660
of course.

301
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.000
You how?

302
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.250
Just try to write in a try.

303
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.750
Block,

304
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.120
Let me write some line.

305
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.750
Number one Our statement One.

306
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.530
You can have any number of statements under this straight statement.

307
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:46.870
Three.

308
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.690
Something like that.

309
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:52.530
If something goes wrong with the anyone of the statement which are there under the word try

310
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.060
block,

311
00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:01.390
then then your Pikom will automatically skip the my block and then it will try to execute

312
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.080
except the block in,

313
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.450
except like a night something.

314
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:19.750
So this is because off something and goes went wrong in by block.

315
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.050
So what is that?

316
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.060
This?

317
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.760
Just just toe tell that something goes wrong in your tribe block.

318
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:34.240
But what I want these I want to see exactly what is the area is there?

319
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.040
Then what?

320
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.910
What is the same text you have to use?

321
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.550
Is Samson bags?

322
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.950
Actually,

323
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.150
no.

324
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.280
This is the useful guys.

325
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.750
These the useful in your real time.

326
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.870
But the his simple way we will see on one level as well.

327
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.930
Except exception as e.

328
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.160
So why I am taking you?

329
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.350
You can take anything,

330
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.400
but this is an error.

331
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.050
That's why just to represent that I'm taking the variable,

332
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.370
right?

333
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.330
No engine off this,

334
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.150
Mrs are what I can write these.

335
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:12.350
So this is because off this is no.

336
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.280
You know what is the area?

337
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.670
I mean,

338
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.050
you're right on most of your fight on handle that with variable called E with help.

339
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.850
Off exception clause here.

340
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.250
This is because off right,

341
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.250
Organized,

342
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:24.710
simply.

343
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.270
This way.

344
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:25.750
That's it.

345
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.550
Right.

346
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.150
Okay.

347
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.690
Now let me show you one more thing.

348
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.230
I'm going to come and entire core.

349
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:47.890
See,

350
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.650
what I'm doing is I have a list accord.

351
00:13:51.650 --> 00:14:03.350
My list equals so some well is 345 Unless if I tried toe print on my list off one or maybe

352
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.480
two.

353
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.390
Whatever it may be,

354
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.730
you're going to get your output.

355
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.750
Write my list opening nothing but four.

356
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:13.050
But if I try to print my list off four.

357
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.490
What is the result?

358
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.770
Targeting how's person doctor is correct,

359
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.250
but my list or four is nothing but 50 Valley from your list,

360
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.400
so we don't have $5.

361
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:24.910
Analyst.

362
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.750
How come this fourth value 50 40 next value can get?

363
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.200
It's not possible,

364
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.450
right?

365
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.170
That's why what is going index at a list index order.

366
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.990
French right?

367
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.660
See one.

368
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.450
I will Louise.

369
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:44.960
I will try to bring my list index off four.

370
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.510
In case if I don't know how many values are there in my list just in there somewhere.

371
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.450
My list is that I don't know why lighting or course you'll come to know how many values

372
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.950
sometimes you need to create dynamically what leads to based on some values.

373
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.280
You don't know how many values are there.

374
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.570
Logical unit to get support,

375
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.450
some 50 value,

376
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.990
then what I will lose.

377
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.950
I would try to print of 50 value in this way,

378
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.850
but there is a chance that is You don't have any Wellies inside off your list.

379
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.730
Maybe he wanted to Alice,

380
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.400
but you're trying to access 50 value.

381
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:23.110
That's why what I'm doing is except exception as e.

382
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:27.390
That I'm trying to print that e so that instead of getting an error,

383
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.650
I can see some message off course.

384
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.910
If you get an error,

385
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.440
you cannot.

386
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.820
We are also going to see my sales,

387
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.050
but the problem is you're going to 10 with your script.

388
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.600
But with the exception handling your not admitting,

389
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:46.350
you still see that after tryin except I'm writing the score will also execute.

390
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:53.170
I don't see that is there you're getting another likely listed next out off range.

391
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.600
This court will also eggs courts.

392
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.620
But instead of that support if I don't have,

393
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:03.240
try and accept a block on if it I do print directly from or list value called 50 value,

394
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.590
see that were 11.

395
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.090
Bring my list off.

396
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:06.420
Four.

397
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:13.450
I'm trying to print see index listing next out off range on your part on program is

398
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.750
stagnating here itself.

399
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.310
It is not right.

400
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.670
That's good.

401
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.150
This one,

402
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.720
it's actually baby.

403
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.120
How many dependency between this line in this line.

404
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.550
Know,

405
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.350
because here you're using list,

406
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.430
but nowhere we're using.

407
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.740
Listen,

408
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.850
39 line.

409
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.480
If you're not using,

410
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.520
then no problem.

411
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.470
You can exclude this land.

412
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.720
No.

413
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.350
Why should we stop your core?

414
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.560
That's why that's the reason we are using.

415
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.260
Try and accept a block in your cool night.

416
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.760
Fine.

417
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.060
So simply you see here this is the same back site,

418
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.490
so try,

419
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.900
But all the main Corey hard to run that.

420
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.250
Cory,

421
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.960
just you just try to write under Pride Block.

422
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.410
So,

423
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.990
in case if if something goes wrong while running your core,

424
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:10.950
then what you want to display then daddy or two right under except a block,

425
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.950
right?

426
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:18.160
So they had just simple thing toe handle your try and accept im into honey or exceptions.

427
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.650
But you know,

428
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.950
the used playing except us,

429
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.840
except exception as he then try to print that era.

430
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.700
This is useful,

431
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.550
right?

432
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:38.260
This one is important.

433
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.400
One.

434
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.950
That's fine.

435
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.030
No,

436
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.470
let me show you some of the I'll,

437
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.550
uh,

438
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.890
examples where you're going to get exceptions.

439
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.280
Index set up.

440
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.020
We have seen their Jiro division area.

441
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.650
We have seen that imported it value error.

442
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.500
What is important to me is just how you know you're trying to import some model.

443
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.420
So if that model is already there with your pipe down as a default model,

444
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.290
then you won't get any exceptions.

445
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.300
But I didn't know anyone bullied,

446
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.060
executes to read,

447
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.310
execute supposed unity.

448
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.270
Use XLR.

449
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.940
The model.

450
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.370
There is no the default motility or python.

451
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:15.800
Then,

452
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.190
while importing this money,

453
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.660
you'll get another right.

454
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.020
So whenever we were trying to import 3rd 40 models Unit to use,

455
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.160
try and accept a block.

456
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.280
Let me show you that as well.

457
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.050
It's important one.

458
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.440
So what I'm doing is let me come.

459
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:41.590
And once again you were called just as soon die.

460
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.930
I need to import a model car.

461
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.850
Suppose some fabric.

462
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.350
I admit on it.

463
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.410
I had no module,

464
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:53.740
right?

465
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.000
No model name called fabric model,

466
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.990
not phone there.

467
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.710
Right?

468
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:00.230
See that?

469
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.570
What I can do is in that case,

470
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:09.490
play except exception as e.

471
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.480
Then I'm bringing some clearer saying shut off,

472
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.260
terminating by your fight on,

473
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.600
we are turning.

474
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.660
We are stopping or skip gracefully,

475
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.550
right?

476
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.450
So that is the way to use your prey and accept a block.

477
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:32.300
That's a so I'm giving get some off the others type better on name error file,

478
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.990
not foreigners or something like that.

479
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.600
Okay,

480
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.710
so we're going forward.

481
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.350
We will see different types off errors and how to handle them.

482
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:45.350
And we have one more video on this just toe handle directly the known errors.

483
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.350
Night.

484
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.130
Okay,

485
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:47.490
days.

486
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.450
One more thing I wear,

487
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.320
we'll see them.

488
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.050
Or all of them were going forward.

489
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.970
Okay,

490
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.490
Don't miss the next video.

491
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:54.850
Okay?

492
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.630
Okay,

493
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.860
guys,

494
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.210
thank you for watching this video.
