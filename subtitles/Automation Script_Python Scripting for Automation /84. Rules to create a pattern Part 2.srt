1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
friends here.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,220
We're going to discuss about part two rules to create a pattern.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,620
See,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,530
already we have seen some of the rules to create your pattern on.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,750
These are the rules.

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,950
Now we're going to see some more rules.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,390
Nobody forced one.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,890
He's carried or cap symbol the meaning for disease.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,150
Start off the stream.

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,520
UN start off the line in case off multilane string.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,900
Anyway,

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,380
As I know,

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,950
you're going to work with single line techstars string.

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,310
So we'll discuss about multi lines while working with your files.

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,150
Fine.

16
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,860
No.

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,100
Let me open my data to get clarity on this uses off carrot symbol.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,980
So first,

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,560
let me import Audie.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,670
Then let me take some text so I'm going to take it.

21
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,190
Is a fight own on it is is it'll learn?

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,650
No,

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm going to take a pattern cord Simply ik that may like,

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,850
uh it and is so now we know that What is the users off scored records?

25
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,970
If you write anything inside of a school record,

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,410
anyone off that that means maybe it Or maybe he's no as off.

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:24,430
Now let me use my find All we already know this how it is going to work from our previous

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:24,750
video.

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,190
Right?

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,850
I'll see that isn't You're getting two times it onto times.

31
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,420
He's because any given text to be held in two places is on including two places it for

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,280
stuff All the seas representing two strings.

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,950
Maybe it are maybe is no.

34
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,850
Suppose if I use carats Symbol here,

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,980
cap symbol here.

36
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,860
Then what is?

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,880
The use is off that in these to work?

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,350
Sorry.

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,970
Not a word is We are still were working with strings only in these two strings.

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,380
If anyone off the string is their very first,

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,710
that is going to fetch only darts String.

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:10,080
If anyone off these two things is there at the very first name given text on because of Cap

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,080
,

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,230
it is going to fetch dark only know See the result annihilating only it Because whenever if

45
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,500
we keep caps Immel,

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,130
it won't look in entire string.

47
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,150
It will look only at the starting off history for your patterns,

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,220
right.

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,760
For your patrons,

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,660
it is Look only at the starting,

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,150
not in the entire string.

52
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,050
That is a use off gap.

53
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,880
No support If I remove this part now,

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,320
what is that?

55
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,380
Very first night given string is no.

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,150
You're fetching that.

57
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,950
See?

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,750
Use may be in the combination with any other word.

59
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,150
Also no problem.

60
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,550
Still were working with strings.

61
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,250
Not a word.

62
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,480
Fine,

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,240
No,

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,160
the same way.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,850
Suppose I want to look any string,

66
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,530
which is there at that end.

67
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,810
Let's say I'm going to write land once again.

68
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,380
Or maybe 23 places.

69
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,150
No problem.

70
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,450
Mostly there is already are getting three times alone.

71
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,530
But I want to print.

72
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,020
If learn is there at the end off a given string,

73
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,870
then the allergy or to use be clear,

74
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,600
were used dollar at the end,

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,350
Not here.

76
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,680
So that is the room.

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
If you use dollar here,

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,970
then your letter expressions will look for this land pattern at the end.

79
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,990
Any given text.

80
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,630
So Carter and all are very,

81
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,540
very important.

82
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,030
No,

83
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,250
the next one is slash B empty string at the beginning or end off a word.

84
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,620
See,

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,550
before going to use this slash B.

86
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:47,860
Let me take this as my string on my next c nd the word because you have a space starting

87
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,050
off that end string on ending off that industry.

88
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,780
But if you take beauty,

89
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,450
that is not a word because starting we held but the ending we don't have.

90
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:04,350
But if you have the empty and word empties having space here at the end aside,

91
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,250
whatever the starting,

92
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,630
you don't help on.

93
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,570
The word is having other starting,

94
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,240
but are the ending.

95
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,570
You don't have a space even though if you don't how This is your starting that for you need

96
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,450
to have any space at this starting side.

97
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,860
And this is the ending work.

98
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,250
That's why you don't have any space at the ending side.

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,450
So you need to remember that if you're going to work for a string,

100
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,840
whether it is a word or not,

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,800
then if it is in between off a were given text,

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,310
then you should look for space at the starting on at the end.

103
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,550
Me,

104
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,240
right?

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,910
But if it is a starting within the entire text,

106
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,670
then you need to have any space on the left.

107
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,050
Aside,

108
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,570
on forward,

109
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,750
you don't need to have any space on the right side.

110
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,750
Now be clear and I'm going to use that.

111
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,270
See,

112
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,350
here I'm taking my part on us simply.

113
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,430
First,

114
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,410
I'm going to take let me take Len.

115
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,130
So how many times you're getting learn pat around,

116
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,090
put three times but I'm looking Printed the land war.

117
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,570
If the space is there,

118
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,270
are the left the side off that land Now see the result anyway,

119
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,350
you're not going to You're not going to get that.

120
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,450
The reason is we know slash B is a backspace generally now here.

121
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,050
Not for backspace purpose.

122
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,050
That's why you have the right to slashes.

123
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,150
You had to escape that No,

124
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,320
See the result laden here We how on right side We have a space on the left side.

125
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,950
We have a space.

126
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,130
What?

127
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,860
This land and this land be clear here we have a space here we have a space.

128
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,100
But for this land,

129
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,210
we don't have space here.

130
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,050
That's why you're not getting that.

131
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,650
We're getting only two.

132
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,450
Yes,

133
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,950
that's fine.

134
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:51,850
So engine of writing to back slashes you can also simply right are drawstring.

135
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,800
So in drawstring,

136
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
right?

137
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,410
You are special characters are going to skip no slash b is going to treat us space,

138
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,520
not a backspace,

139
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,390
simply space,

140
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,700
right?

141
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,120
That's why from now onwards,

142
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,510
I'm going to use our well grading your pattern.

143
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,080
Actually,

144
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,030
that is a good practice.

145
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,650
You can take it,

146
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,740
right?

147
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,290
Fine.

148
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,820
No see,

149
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,350
though.

150
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,270
Next thing I run how space he?

151
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,640
Uh,

152
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:22,940
yeah,

153
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,850
maybe No.

154
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,850
Okay.

155
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,330
No.

156
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,330
See if I run these or is output Len?

157
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,890
Len,

158
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,130
I'm not mentioning any space at the ending.

159
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,310
No,

160
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,230
my requirement is completely I'm looking for a learned word.

161
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,680
That's why you should our space at the starting on attending.

162
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,060
That's why I'm making here string pattern with a slash b and slash being the starting on

163
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,650
the ending.

164
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,650
Now,

165
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,860
the meaning for this is look for aylan work because I mentioned the year slash b and end

166
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,490
the inside also slash b no.

167
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:03,350
See the result only accept last learn know where we have learned were all our combination

168
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,390
with some other things.

169
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,650
Not let people read space here for these.

170
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,430
Now,

171
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,960
this is also a word,

172
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,250
right,

173
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,610
Len?

174
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,460
No.

175
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,430
If I run this court once again,

176
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,980
you're going to get two times less.

177
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,450
So that is the use off slash B.

178
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,480
Okay.

179
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,180
Make sure that for this land,

180
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,250
we don't have any space at the left right side.

181
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,530
Even though if you don't have that is the ending would in a given text.

182
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,830
That's why you need to have any space are the right side for that world.

183
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,450
But he should have space here.

184
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,530
I mean,

185
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,350
left aside,

186
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,250
that's it.

187
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,550
Now the next one is capital B.

188
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,390
Empty string north or the beginning,

189
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,750
or end off a word.

190
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,700
So it's huh?

191
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,660
It is a very Vera used case with the Capital B.

192
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,950
But we have options.

193
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,780
We need to London first.

194
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,880
Let me do one thing.

195
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,050
Let me remove this land and this land.

196
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,980
Don't get confused.

197
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,640
Very simple,

198
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,650
But try to understand.

199
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,650
Suppose you for take?

200
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,850
Simply learned you're getting.

201
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,110
But if I take slash B on a slash B here means starting.

202
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,640
I should have a space on anything also I should have a space.

203
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:21,890
I mean,

204
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm looking for it worked.

205
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,480
Do you have that type of what?

206
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,210
Any given string?

207
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,510
New,

208
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,530
right.

209
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,210
Fine.

210
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,740
Neiffer,

211
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,750
take capital B.

212
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,950
I don't want space at the starting off.

213
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,480
Your word are the same time.

214
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,150
I don't want space at the ending off history.

215
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,750
Yes,

216
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,050
we have done here Now if I write somewhere land separately.

217
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,040
No,

218
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,910
For this land we have a space at the starting on our day and me.

219
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,100
But what is my intention?

220
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,090
Find the learn string,

221
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:07,710
which is not having space at the right side or left aside Our find the learn string which

222
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,260
is not having a space are starting or are the ending No,

223
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,950
See the result?

224
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,960
It won't affect this.

225
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,550
Only you're not fetching this.

226
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,890
If I remove this land,

227
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,300
then you are going to get empty.

228
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,320
Because Norway,

229
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,470
we have a learned word in a given text such a that it is not having any spaces at this

230
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,650
starting or ending as after.

231
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,480
You have learned word,

232
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,770
but it is having a space at the starting on our standing.

233
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,070
But you're looking we told spaces.

234
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,980
Are we getting output?

235
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,450
No,

236
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,050
that's it.

237
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,960
So that is the use off slash B capital B,

238
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,750
right?

239
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,960
No,

240
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:57,860
the next thing is slash t slash in slash are fab new lines on Gary's rhythm See place as

241
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,050
off.

242
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,500
No.

243
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:06,150
Suppose if I try to look for a pattern using your words slash t nor put because while

244
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,170
typing my text nowhere I used the tab key on my keyboard.

245
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,500
No,

246
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,550
let me you somewhere on somewhere tub.

247
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,350
Sorry.

248
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,050
So what happened?

249
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,250
Yeah.

250
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,220
Now see the result.

251
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,630
Two places I use slash t.

252
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,560
That's why you're getting that?

253
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,930
No.

254
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,710
Let me write somewhere New line on.

255
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:36,850
Let me modify your pattern with respect to in Not Okay.

256
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,510
So based disorder,

257
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,330
simple hydrant.

258
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,700
Those to get your pattern.

259
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,350
So he had important thing is starting ending.

260
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,380
And this is very,

261
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,240
very important.

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,990
If you want to look for a word,

263
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,550
then slash B is very,

264
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,450
very useful on while using slash b into use blustering.

265
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,960
That's right from no one.

266
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,910
Words were going forward when it But if I want to create a pattern,

267
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,390
I will use anyone in my pattern or letter as well or character as well.

268
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,750
So that that isn't Ross Tree.

269
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,180
That's what I think.

270
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,320
Is that okay?

271
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,960
Okay,

272
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,270
guys,

273
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,650
thank you for watching this for you.
