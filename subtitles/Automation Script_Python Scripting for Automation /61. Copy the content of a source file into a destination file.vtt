00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
friends here.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.570
We're going to see how to copy if I into another file using python or simply completely

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.550
content off a file to another fight.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.350
Lennon Jr.

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.550
You have your file with some content in one location in any location and your host.

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.260
And what about the data you have in that file?

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.040
That data I want to copy to some another file,

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.750
which is there in maybe same location or in different locations.

9
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.550
So this entire data I want to copy and do this fight a gender.

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.090
This is a source file on this is a destination file.

11
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.560
So what you're doing,

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.040
I simply the content which is there in your source file that content.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.250
You're going to write it into destination file?

14
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.290
No.

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.070
First of what?

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.200
You're to go read the content off your source file,

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.970
then.

18
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.280
But later you from your sword fight that they're not.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.150
Just write it into a destination for you know,

20
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.240
if you want to read a data from any file in your pie Tawni Hart,

21
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.850
A weapon that fighting read more.

22
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.320
And if you want to write any content to your file,

23
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.080
then you're a weapon that filing right more read more you can able to read,

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.950
Write more the content which you have in your hand that continue can write it into your

25
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.050
file logic.

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.950
So let me weapon my editor just to write your python script.

27
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.460
So what I'm doing is simply I'm going toe survey a python skip name as source to a

28
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.650
destination dot Right,

29
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.030
So let me take faster fall source If I You can take any file as off No,

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.250
let me say my file as let's say,

31
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.350
Oh,

32
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.080
yeah,

33
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.050
I have somewhere file Let me take that.

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.740
Suppose if you're very here I have a file called random in the house.

35
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.650
Some three lines.

36
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.450
Let me take this file in first random dot Txt and I want oh,

37
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.410
corporate this country to some destination for let's set destination file name equals two

38
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.350
new random dot Txt.

39
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.220
So,

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.660
first of all source file content,

41
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.550
he hard to read.

42
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.690
Then what?

43
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.600
All that data you are reading from source from that data with the right and do this nation

44
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.870
file.

45
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.500
So what I'm doing is let me Oh,

46
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.800
really?

47
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.650
The content from your source file first,

48
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.850
so source file objective was to open that source file in.

49
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.780
Read more,

50
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.600
then let me close the You are open to file source file dot clothes.

51
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.150
Let me say we don't go on it.

52
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.250
You're not getting anything.

53
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.600
You open your file and read more,

54
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.900
but very sore data.

55
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.520
See if you want to see the data.

56
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.730
If you want to read the data from your source file,

57
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.950
you know,

58
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.540
and in any variable order,

59
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.920
let music content equals to your source file.

60
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.730
Object door.

61
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.450
Read Really entire data as a string.

62
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.140
You know,

63
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.210
you have different operations.

64
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.580
Really?

65
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.950
Read line read lines.

66
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.090
So really,

67
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.510
the string really,

68
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.250
This spring read lines is a list.

69
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.940
So I'm going to read the entire data as a string.

70
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.450
Yes,

71
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.730
you can.

72
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.100
Really?

73
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.330
No.

74
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.300
Let me print the data from your source file.

75
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.750
Whatever the data you are reading,

76
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.720
Yes,

77
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.150
that's it.

78
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.810
But this did I want to write it into in my this nation filing Nothing is there.

79
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.770
It's very simple.

80
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.400
If you want to write any day time to your file water,

81
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.220
how to do just a weapon That file Let me take this nation file object because toe open and

82
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.040
then destination file.

83
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.370
Guys,

84
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.650
our file name is already there in this variable.

85
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.050
Then write more,

86
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.910
then close that file.

87
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.750
But before going to close,

88
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.030
you want to write the content in your destination,

89
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.990
for that's why you want destination file thought right already.

90
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.310
How in your hand the content off your source file that that is with the variable called

91
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.750
content.

92
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.700
So we then that's good money.

93
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.450
Then let me see that there is a new random file in our location.

94
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.480
Let me start with the end.

95
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.750
Yeah,

96
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.320
New random is there.

97
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.450
That's it.

98
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.480
Right on.

99
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.070
One more thing.

100
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.850
I suppose this random dot txt I am copying into day stop location,

101
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.360
right.

102
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.950
Fine.

103
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.400
Now you feel very your pie transcript.

104
00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.060
This fight landscape is there in suppose some different locations fight on Scripture

105
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.950
territory You how your python skills and I'm runny.

106
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.650
See that what you're getting?

107
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.370
You're getting another.

108
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.330
Like while you're opening your source file.

109
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.120
You're getting an error like no such file or territory.

110
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.430
The reason is you're fighting,

111
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.800
Skippy.

112
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.830
Is there somewhere?

113
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.730
Fight on skip territory under they stop.

114
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.820
You have a directory called by transcripts under that,

115
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.850
we are your python scripts.

116
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.520
But your random dot txt is not they in the location.

117
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.350
Where you how your by transcript that is there in a different location called this stop.

118
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.410
So that's why even ever if you're trying to read or write or even know what if you're

119
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.650
working with any files by the power complete part,

120
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.400
right?

121
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.970
See,

122
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.900
You know what I'm doing is I'm going to take complete part.

123
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.250
Let's say I need to stop up.

124
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.780
So this is Windows.

125
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.280
That's why whenever if you are giving a part,

126
00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:05.900
please provide two slashes in your path That's her no destination for look isn't simply are

127
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.950
giving file name,

128
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.470
but where you want to store.

129
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.050
Exactly.

130
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.550
If you don't provide any company park,

131
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.310
then that this nation file will create in the location off where your python Skippy is

132
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.770
there.

133
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.020
From which location you're running your pie.

134
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.350
Transcript in that location on it will create.

135
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.840
Now I want to create my piped.

136
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.450
I'm in my destination file in a different location called suppose downloads.

137
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.110
Right.

138
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.590
So I want to create my destination file called Don't know its location.

139
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.050
Let's say copy that.

140
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.850
Provide the complete part.

141
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.940
Don't lords so big?

142
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.550
Clear where nobody fear working with fire spot,

143
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.050
you have to provide two slashes in your file parts in order windows,

144
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.260
not at least save it on before going to run.

145
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.760
I don't after that.

146
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.420
In their stop,

147
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.750
you don't have any file called new random dot txt.

148
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.650
Now I'm going to save it and run it.

149
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.350
You're by dance contest.

150
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.910
Come together.

151
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.630
After that,

152
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.750
there is a file creator,

153
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.150
new random not to.

154
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.680
And as I have,

155
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.250
no whatever the pipe landscape,

156
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.270
you how in your hand that is always going to work with the fixer filing random.

157
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.950
And then there's going to create a destination file called new random dot txt.

158
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.750
But I don't want Billy in this way.

159
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.130
Whenever.

160
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.480
If I run my fight on Skip,

161
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.350
it has to ask.

162
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.200
Enter your source file under destination file,

163
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.850
then that's good.

164
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.500
So that's why what I'm doing is simply I'm going to come in these two lines now injured off

165
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.290
these two lines.

166
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.410
What I'm reading is source of highly closed toe.

167
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.030
I want to read the source file location while running.

168
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:48.150
It was script and very word Sourcefire location or source file.

169
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.830
Now this script is like a dynamic skip.

170
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:58.350
It will work on any required files like ended we were destination.

171
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.610
Why not?

172
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.790
Seven Goto com Online Nice In sub Olympics,

173
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.730
you can probably input.

174
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.220
That's why I'm going to run my pythons.

175
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:13.920
Get from let's say we How are Python scripts on very year?

176
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.810
Our by transcript,

177
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.290
please.

178
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.350
Source to a destination?

179
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.520
No,

180
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.650
I'm going to run this.

181
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:27.490
So what I'm doing is I want to I want to copy our pipe landscape itself.

182
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.550
Discharge in there.

183
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:37.150
I want to copy our fight and skipped itself into some different location.

184
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.090
Oh,

185
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.390
let me Coffee company part then.

186
00:08:42.390 --> 00:09:01.470
So in this location we have our fight on script and let me probably two slashes by phone

187
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:07.300
scripts then s underscore did not the way this file.

188
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.180
I need to copy this file content.

189
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.990
I need to copy into some different location with same name or different name.

190
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.940
But that is your wish.

191
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.270
Let's say I want to move this into suppose for the stop location.

192
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.150
I want to copy this file into the stop location.

193
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.960
In the best stop,

194
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.340
I want to provide same pythons.

195
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.730
Group name?

196
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.070
Yes,

197
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.260
you can out of its some different name.

198
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.600
Also you can provide Yes.

199
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.740
Let let's say I'm taking same filing Okay.

200
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.150
Under.

201
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.010
Then go to your they stop.

202
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.250
No,

203
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.650
such for Yes.

204
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.840
Underscore d Yes,

205
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.910
it has been created.

206
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.650
Weapon that file and see the country.

207
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.690
You got it right?

208
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.840
So simply,

209
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.280
this is a fight on scape.

210
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.620
Just toe copy.

211
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.480
Source file content into destination.

212
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.850
Fight.

213
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.750
Right.

214
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.100
Un guys,

215
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.550
you may get.

216
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.350
Don't suppose if you go with your UNIX or a Windows,

217
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.220
there are some commands,

218
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.050
like CP source of file.

219
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.450
Then this nation file single lane core is enough.

220
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:11.710
Right?

221
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:18.040
But why were writing this money number off lines to copy your source content of this nation

222
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.380
fight.

223
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.560
Right.

224
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.510
So as off known,

225
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.920
there is no much uses,

226
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.100
but we're going forward.

227
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.250
This concept is very,

228
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.050
very helpful.

229
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:26.310
Very,

230
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.100
very useful,

231
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:33.150
but that I just have given collection to copy one final content into another file content

232
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.450
like here.

233
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.880
And one more thing.

234
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.550
Last point.

235
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.970
So by default,

236
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.390
guys,

237
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.300
by the fall,

238
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.320
if you don't weapon,

239
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.880
you are filing read more.

240
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.750
I mean,

241
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.410
if you don't provide any more well,

242
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.030
opening your file by default,

243
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.050
that is a read more.

244
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.420
If you want to verify,

245
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:57.220
let's say bring your source file dot What is the more for that right now.

246
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.650
What I'm doing is I'm going toe just run here itself.

247
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:07.630
So I'm going to provide fixer violence after the output they're getting Are are that means

248
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:13.230
if you weapon your file without mentioning any more biting for that is they read more.

249
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.650
That's it.

250
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.250
Right?

251
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.450
Okay.

252
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.050
Okay,

253
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.320
guys,

254
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.250
thank you for watching this video while going forward will use this concept to work with

255
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.620
some real time scenarios,

256
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.150
okay?
