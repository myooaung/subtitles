1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
friends here.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,030
We're going to discuss a more to one of the operation from your sis model.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,020
That is called cis dot org Sister arguments.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,470
What is this seeing?

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:24,280
Sister Argov returns a list that consist off command line arguments which are passed to

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,450
your python script simply.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,420
It is giving enlistments.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,450
It is available now,

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,020
actually,

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,740
is one of the operation from your sis model.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,050
We know operation may be a function or maybe available.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,860
So say start.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,450
Arjun is giving a list,

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,150
right?

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,050
So which consist off some command line arguments which are pastor to your pie transcript.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,710
So to understand this,

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,230
first of all,

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,950
you have to know what is a common line argument night.

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,850
Let me weapon some script.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,650
Let me open my reader.

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,050
So I'm going to write the script accord.

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:16,370
Command line arguments come in length arguments Not be way so something I'm writing Nothing

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:16,370
.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,280
Is this emblem reading?

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,650
Hello?

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,070
That's it.

27
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,720
Now I'm going to run from command line.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,040
So if you want to work,

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,160
if you want to know command line arguments always yard run your script from command line

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,750
only.

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,250
Fine.

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,480
So just know we heard it on the script to called this one nothing.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,370
Is that simply print?

34
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:36,650
Hello?

35
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,590
Let me run this fight on common line arguments.

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,080
Your skip name dot Yes.

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,010
You're getting some output night?

38
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,340
No,

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,450
While running your scrip while running your script by your fight on interpreter.

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,250
I'm also passing some values called suppose height.

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,350
How are you?

42
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,690
Some number one?

43
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,840
Number 3 67 moderate,

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,150
maybe.

45
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,150
See if you pass in this way just after their baby.

46
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,550
How in the serpents with your script.

47
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,050
Is there any longer?

48
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,960
Put No,

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,050
it's working perfectly.

50
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,580
See,

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,980
after he was script name,

52
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,800
if I passed some values,

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,450
they're not disturbing your script.

54
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,810
Just awful in this way,

55
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,580
if you pass.

56
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,190
Yes,

57
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,490
actually,

58
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,170
that is the correct.

59
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,650
You can pass in that where there is no wrong in that.

60
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,060
If it is wrong,

61
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,420
then you ought to get some other right?

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,970
You're not getting any other.

63
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,160
That means yes,

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,850
you can run your script bypassing some values in this way.

65
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,950
No.

66
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,550
After you were script name,

67
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,850
whatever you're bossing,

68
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,720
right?

69
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,810
So these all are called command line arguments for your script while running your skip,

70
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,350
your passing somewhere lose.

71
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,200
These are called commonly in arguments,

72
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,220
right?

73
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,750
So if you're passing some common land of Mencia.

74
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,720
If you're passing some common in arguments here,

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,260
how you can get them inside off your pipe.

76
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,650
Monster,

77
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,280
Right?

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,120
Saying nothing.

79
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,790
Is that what I'm doing is simply now let me remove print.

80
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,150
Hello?

81
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,860
You're gonna get anything right?

82
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,350
I'm writing print six dot R D V.

83
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,150
That is a variable,

84
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,870
but you're using six,

85
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,210
right?

86
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,510
That's why I want you to go.

87
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,180
Unit imports is right now.

88
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,580
See,

89
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,310
first of all,

90
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,350
of Jerry was script.

91
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,030
What?

92
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,420
You How inside off your skin.

93
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,770
Nothing is there.

94
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,750
I'm using cysts.

95
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,580
That's why I'm importing that sits first.

96
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,710
Then I'm printing simply six dot org.

97
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,980
First time running your scripting.

98
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,280
This way,

99
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,690
guys.

100
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,300
Observed output What you're getting You're getting a list of which contest off your script

101
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,560
name?

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,310
Only because after he was script name you're not passing anything in case if you pass what

103
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,260
will happen just I'm passing suppose bite on some shell,

104
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,060
some pearl,

105
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,840
something like that.

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,850
So it's it output.

107
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,570
Whatever you are passing here,

108
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,850
all these values are coming in this a variable called cis dot org.

109
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,250
As a list.

110
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,450
Not only that,

111
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,550
you can pass some values also see the output.

112
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:17,150
No season dot org v is capturing inside off your script,

113
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,710
Whatever the values,

114
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,050
whatever the arguments,

115
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,350
your bossing while running your script.

116
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,820
Right.

117
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,240
So these are the common land arguments you are passing while running your skip on.

118
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,140
You can handle these values inside off your script with help off says dot org,

119
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,840
it's very,

120
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,650
very helpful.

121
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,430
Right on.

122
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,720
You need to remember one more thing.

123
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,070
What are the values you are passing from Cameron Lines?

124
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,590
Even though if it is a number,

125
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,880
see that it is treating as a string.

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,150
That's why you have a quotation here,

127
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,990
you know,

128
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,860
in python Tried if I write X equals to some list consist off work.

129
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:52,990
Um,

130
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,360
if I then here for and four year values of the Lord put you are you are not having any

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,470
conditions but here you having a quotation for your numbers?

132
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,730
That means what the were you are passing from common line.

133
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:11,150
All will treat as a thing by your fight on night.

134
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,210
Fine.

135
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,230
Let me take one simple example to understand this example.

136
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,620
Yeah,

137
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,090
One more thing is See,

138
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,980
this is going to do all your Cumberland arguments right on.

139
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,150
If you are very road port.

140
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,250
The very first values always your script.

141
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,000
How many values you're passing?

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,300
How many command line arguments?

143
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,950
Your passing,

144
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,160
right?

145
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,620
Whatever your passing.

146
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,960
That index Jiro is always a script name.

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,290
See that?

148
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,150
Now I'm passing only one common argument you're getting Index showed us your script Name

149
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,460
remaining all our work.

150
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,240
Command line arguments.

151
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,850
Right.

152
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,800
So if I want to display only script name Born on how to do sys door if you remember.

153
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,970
If you remember list operations,

154
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,800
I want to get only the first index value.

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,720
I mean,

156
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,410
the foster value.

157
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,450
New at least that is indexes always Jiro,

158
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,650
right.

159
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,950
Let me read on and see the output because off Let me weapon you escape once again here

160
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,630
because off bring to see Sergey v.

161
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,550
Jiro You are getting this common line arguments as a script name.

162
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,590
Joe is always skip name in your seats dot org because it's not.

163
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,030
Our job is a list in that foster values always seal script name.

164
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,650
That's what I'm getting within next zero.

165
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,610
That's fine.

166
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,850
No,

167
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,220
guys,

168
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,970
I have a small requirement.

169
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,450
My requirement is my script has to read some string.

170
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,250
My script has to read some string,

171
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,750
then off of that,

172
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,150
I need to convert based on my requirement requirement.

173
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,120
Sometimes I will convert into lower case.

174
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,890
Sometimes I will convert into uppercase.

175
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,790
Sometimes I will convert into title format.

176
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,430
Right?

177
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,710
Forget about first your command line arguments.

178
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,640
So if you want to provide some string to your script,

179
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,450
what you have to do,

180
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,410
let me do this thing.

181
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,650
Ah,

182
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,670
At midday,

183
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,660
user strength equals two.

184
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,870
If you want to read a string,

185
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,810
always your to take input as it let me save it.

186
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,260
Actions on strings,

187
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,490
Not the way right.

188
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:16,910
See,

189
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,480
here I am reading a string from commonly user stringy question.

190
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
Put entire Iwas string.

191
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,250
I'm asking,

192
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,340
then offer that user action I'm reading.

193
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:29,930
What is that?

194
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,150
Action means input.

195
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,050
Anthony.

196
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,090
What action on your string.

197
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:47,920
So value actions are just I'm giving the Clue Valley actions or like lower got up.

198
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,250
But,

199
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,990
well,

200
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,150
suppose title for Mitt.

201
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,680
That's it.

202
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,650
So these are the values I need to read from user.

203
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,520
Now imagine that you there is going to enter some string and user is going to enter

204
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,550
someone's lower operate writing format.

205
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,280
No,

206
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,850
based on user request,

207
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,750
I need to print the wellspring in lower case or upper case or in the pedal Former.

208
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,650
That's why year and you could take if condition foster for right.

209
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:21,310
If user action it cost to lower right now how to print.

210
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,410
They were given string.

211
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,230
That is yours.

212
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,500
User string into lower case.

213
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,650
Will you hold different options?

214
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,040
You're right,

215
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,560
user may enter like up,

216
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,080
but also so I'm checking If user action is upward Then I'm going toe bring to my youth

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:50,870
string in terms off uppercase right else If if user action If you is the action in Costa

218
00:08:50,870 --> 00:09:00,540
title format then I'm printing user string dot Vital in Goodbye,

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,670
Mr Give user end us other than lower upper tighty Then I'm writing else block And I'm

220
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,800
saying please your option is invalid,

221
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,550
right?

222
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:21,550
So please select valid options from this list.

223
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,610
So where are the vile options?

224
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,520
Lower up.

225
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,550
But then my deal left it Fine,

226
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,570
right?

227
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,420
Let me go on run descript from command line So first of all,

228
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,170
he was script This is your script.

229
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:37,920
Let me run.

230
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,380
You can see the output first I am running I am profiting string Call some randomly.

231
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,850
I'm providing in this way Fight on scripting something like that.

232
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,070
Then I want to convert my string into lower operatically Any option you can provide?

233
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,850
I'm giving supposed title for my then see the airport You're getting in the title Former

234
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,320
Then I'm relearning And now I'm going to provide lower I want to convert my string in the

235
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,900
lower case.

236
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,160
Yes,

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,500
fine.

238
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,190
But what?

239
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,460
I would escape you How?

240
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:16,110
No You escape needs of two inputs One is string one more is user action One is string one

241
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:25,590
more issues direction but wild running script Your broiling right See after running I'm

242
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,850
impacting with my script.

243
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes,

244
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:35,090
you can in fact But my intention is I don't want to provide in this way I hope Run with one

245
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,050
step How to run my skipping one step then how you can do it?

246
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,590
See for that I have the idea.

247
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,900
What I will do is first command line arguments I will send as a I will send a string

248
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,400
requesting like fight on scripting Then second argument right?

249
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:58,300
I will provide action like lower Then I will end up so that it has to work right?

250
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,050
No,

251
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:05,940
If you passed in this way you have to use your sis model on you can handle them a string as

252
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,460
your first argument night inaction is second argument.

253
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,750
Now what I'm doing is insured off using input.

254
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,350
No,

255
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,940
I'm going to come.

256
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,630
And these two things Now I'm going to import your system model,

257
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,260
then user string.

258
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,760
I am taking nice.

259
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,580
If you remember,

260
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,690
Sister at our TV is going to give your all common land arguments right in that Ju it

261
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,950
argument is the script name.

262
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,920
Then see if you are running in this way.

263
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,010
If you are running in this way,

264
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,090
let me do that thing first.

265
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:46,130
Other ways I will come into your entire court right now.

266
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:55,290
What I'm doing is I'm going to print the world Spring says dot org We first like No,

267
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,600
let me run this and see the output.

268
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,850
If you run in this way,

269
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,190
you're getting a list inside off.

270
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,250
Your escaped with help off Sister RGB in their index,

271
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,700
Joey's skip name index one easy were given string on index to is user action.

272
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,450
That's what you are getting by running in this way with help offset start rgb right.

273
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,650
So that is whenever if you want those pass on argument,

274
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,520
which consist off some spaces.

275
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,050
Then you had to write their entire string inside of quotation,

276
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,850
right?

277
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,550
No see?

278
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,550
No.

279
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,680
Because with the help of systems RGB,

280
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,860
you're able to get your command line arguments inside off your script.

281
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,760
That's why what I'm doing is use a string I cannot sign Index one.

282
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,050
Right.

283
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,890
So this is not our GV index one.

284
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,830
I am assigning for you.

285
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:58,990
The string on user action says door odd GV index to that's it like No,

286
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,840
let me run your script.

287
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,750
Consider magic.

288
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,700
No,

289
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,250
I'm not going to use input command and I'm not going toe provide multiple lines.

290
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,090
Input for he was kept only single step just running this way.

291
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,830
Sit output.

292
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,480
You're getting your string in lower case.

293
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,410
Maybe you're getting confusion because the entire thing is in lower case.

294
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:27,010
Let me go in this way I see the output forgetting sting in lower case or let me pass year

295
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,350
upper Let me past ideal.

296
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,660
Yes,

297
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,350
it's perfectly working right,

298
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,550
But the year a small drawback is there.

299
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,370
What does that mean by mistake?

300
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:49,330
Suppose if I'm not passing this you're getting another listing next out off range because

301
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,450
you're passing only skip name on a string name.

302
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,350
What about action?

303
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,410
Action is always index vituperation.

304
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,850
You are taken inside office script,

305
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,470
but you're not passing three values.

306
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,550
If you passed three values,

307
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,360
then he convicts in next three you're passing.

308
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,750
Wanted to values that is skip name other than string.

309
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,960
Name the DJ right Index that his foster next.

310
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,300
Then what?

311
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,350
Aboard second Index?

312
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,610
You're not passing,

313
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,880
but you're sending that.

314
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,050
You're sending that in next to value to this action.

315
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,060
So without having second index value,

316
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,150
how can you assign that value to other variable?

317
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,140
That's not possible.

318
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,440
That's why you're getting another right.

319
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,940
So whenever if you're using common land arguments with help off sis dot org,

320
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,250
you have to take care.

321
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,430
What is that girl?

322
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,340
How you can take it like I think Is that very simple?

323
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,920
Observed that So there's for our scrip for our stupors off.

324
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,130
No,

325
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,580
whatever.

326
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,750
We are working using lower upper title for murder.

327
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,150
How many common land arguments we need?

328
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,550
One is group name.

329
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,120
2nd 1 is string 3rd 1 is action.

330
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,730
So three values your passing then only discouraging If you passed to others,

331
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,750
then it is not correct.

332
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,520
Even if you passed more than three,

333
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,350
known it off four values.

334
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,040
That's why what I'm doing is before running before assigning you are command line arguments

335
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,920
to your variable.

336
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,520
First of all,

337
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,350
I am finally bring the number off common land arguments.

338
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,870
If you remember,

339
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,640
if you have a list if you have a list,

340
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,150
you can find out number off values in their by using length function.

341
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,030
So sister dodgy visa list.

342
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,350
Right?

343
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,700
And I'm finding number of values.

344
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,450
Let me come and your entire core first.

345
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,460
No,

346
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,800
run your script and see the output.

347
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,050
Yes,

348
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,250
you're getting three because you're passing Skip name.

349
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,540
First command line argument.

350
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,890
Second Cumberland argument.

351
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,350
If I pass in this way,

352
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,650
what is that?

353
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,850
You have it only supposed something.

354
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,050
Then you're getting too,

355
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,790
but nobody could get to.

356
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,870
That is not correct.

357
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,710
You're not running.

358
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,140
You're skipping the proper way because you need three values.

359
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,210
Finally year with including your script name Skip.

360
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,350
Name your spring under the new action.

361
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,590
That's why what I'm doing is whenever if this value is not,

362
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,150
of course to three right beef,

363
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:23,350
see that if lent off your sis not or GV here for days.

364
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,880
Not because 23 every cost three.

365
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,390
No problem.

366
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:35,010
If it is not because 23 then I can't assign Second Nordmann value to your your direction.

367
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,650
Not because three minutes as you know you're sending on to values.

368
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,490
Then it's not correct.

369
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,760
No,

370
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,750
that's why whenever,

371
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,010
if your number off arguments are not because 23 maybe you are more than three I need only

372
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,830
exactly three,

373
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,720
including your script,

374
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,060
name,

375
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,660
script,

376
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,010
name,

377
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,600
string,

378
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,560
name in action.

379
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,400
It should now three only in guess if it is not because 23 then I want to stop my scrip.

380
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,390
You know you can stop your skip using seized art exhibit.

381
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,120
Previously we discussed this right In previous video.

382
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,850
We'll see the music now You don't get any other previously where nobody if you don't have

383
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,980
this lousy let me,

384
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,620
Kartik and save it and done it Once again,

385
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,160
you're getting another right index range index era listing that sort of fringe.

386
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,540
But what I'm doing is I'm saving this now with help of the simple of condition.

387
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,620
Now I'm running.

388
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,270
You're not getting any better simply or fight on is stopping your skipped whenever If you

389
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,690
are not passing proper command line arguments.

390
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,670
But simply stopping is not a good practice Whenever.

391
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,340
If we are not passing exactly three arguments,

392
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,070
then simply or stopping right before stopping,

393
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,850
just try to read some message.

394
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,450
Bring use a day off descript usage.

395
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,340
Use disease.

396
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,500
Bring us is not or gv on TV.

397
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,030
Skip name.

398
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,710
Then offer that what you want to do,

399
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,960
right?

400
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,260
Let me do off if strings.

401
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,660
So you says I'm I'm writing.

402
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,160
So print the you escape name,

403
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,350
then then here you have to pass.

404
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,760
Posse was string.

405
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,940
You are required.

406
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,620
String I'm writing.

407
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,510
Suppose you were required.

408
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,550
String here then.

409
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,370
Here you are to right.

410
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,410
Action action is like lower Oh,

411
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,050
upper for title.

412
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,170
That's it.

413
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,990
No,

414
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,050
I'm saving this and I'm going to run.

415
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,000
Guys,

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,290
try to understand this.

417
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,260
It's very useful.

418
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm running in this way.

419
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,660
Then you're getting new cities.

420
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,720
You have to run this keeping this way.

421
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Action on strings,

422
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,510
not B y.

423
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,620
Then you are string.

424
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,450
Then some action.

425
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,890
You have to cooperate like lower or upper Our title.

426
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,820
Now I'm going to provide in the probably suppose I'm running up notes working properly if

427
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,100
you are not passing common land arguments perfectly,

428
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,680
then only are getting usage.

429
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,050
Otherwise it's working perfectly.

430
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,950
Right?

431
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,100
So guys,

432
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,410
finally here we got the concept off sis dot org and sister Exit as well.

433
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,660
So that's why it says not exist.

434
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,600
Exist is sister Exit is very helpful in your real time.

435
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,780
Why we are using just to stop your script when we're stopping.

436
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,220
If you're not passing proper common Leinart Gwynn's If you're not passing proper command

437
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,720
line arguments,

438
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,870
what will happen because of this line?

439
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,740
You're getting another.

440
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,630
I don't want to get another right.

441
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,120
That's why when you will get another if you're not passing proper arguments So whenever if

442
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,180
you are not passing proper arguments,

443
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,550
I'm going to stop my script by simply saying this information to the user.

444
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,350
Please run this script in this way.

445
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,290
Uses off strip I'm giving,

446
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,610
and then I'm stopping the next time.

447
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,100
Whenever the user is going to surround you escape,

448
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,050
he will take care how to run issue,

449
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,760
right.

450
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Okay.

451
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,030
Okay,

452
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,420
guys,

453
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,930
thank you for watching this video.

454
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,710
It is very,

455
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,580
very important.

456
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,190
While writing your scripts says not our TV.

457
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,380
All right,

458
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,010
fine.
