ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
friends here.

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.530
We're going to see the simple uses off your functions that is converting given court in

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.830
terms,

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.150
off functions without changing the output.

5
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.820
Actually,

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.160
I have a simple by transcript.

7
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the fight and skip under his door.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.650
Put for that?

9
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960
No,

10
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.650
I want to implement the score in terms,

11
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.510
off functions,

12
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.730
friends.

13
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.570
We know that generally we used our functions Whenever there is a reusable t right.

14
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.300
Not only for that Arjun dirty how some thousands off lines in your core injured off writing

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.850
line by line Children lines in your script.

16
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.250
It's better cook the wire you our entire program into some parts based on the logic.

17
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.250
I mean,

18
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.910
if you have your our court,

19
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.650
we have six lines off course,

20
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.580
right?

21
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.500
Assume that forced to lines are for simply,

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.750
like welcome message.

23
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.700
Right on 2nd 2 lines are represent.

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.940
Suppose this is what our the concepts,

25
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.420
you know,

26
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850
known concepts.

27
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:13.190
I just assumed that known concepts and last two lines or you are learning concepts.

28
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.560
No,

29
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.160
If you observe my entire script,

30
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.880
I can divide into three parts.

31
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.110
One party's welcome message.

32
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.360
Second parties,

33
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.850
known concepts,

34
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.950
tired parties,

35
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.150
11 concepts.

36
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.590
So if you divide your record in terms off three parts,

37
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.800
then readable movies more right.

38
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.600
No functions are not only for reusability purpose.

39
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.850
It is also for readability purpose,

40
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.850
right?

41
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.210
Yes,

42
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.160
I June dirty hotels in self lanes Court and you implemented story on After one year you're

43
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.860
coming back and you're going through that lousy directly.

44
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350
Can't understand What is the logic?

45
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.250
You implement it,

46
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.990
interrupt that if you divide you were courting comes off some separate parts Then by seeing

47
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.750
each and every part you can easily understand,

48
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.370
This party is so and so purpose.

49
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.510
This party is so and so purpose,

50
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.700
right?

51
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.250
So that's way.

52
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.380
If you try to implement your court in terms off functions,

53
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.570
then there is a more readable de now for that.

54
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.150
What I'm doing is anybody's with very simple example.

55
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.360
But just to get your idea on functions,

56
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.150
I'm trying to convert this court in terms off functions.

57
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.540
So before going to convert guys already,

58
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.720
we know if you want to write a function,

59
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.520
but you need to define functions,

60
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.850
right?

61
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.070
So you know how to define a function as well.

62
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.600
You have to use the UFT work,

63
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.650
then some name,

64
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.420
right?

65
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.000
Some name,

66
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.010
anything right,

67
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.850
some exquisite,

68
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.720
then parenthesis colon.

69
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.970
Then you had to write some number off lines based on your requirement and finally hard to

70
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.350
write.

71
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.950
Return none.

72
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.970
Right?

73
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.110
We'll discuss aboard Return,

74
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.180
but because the standard scene backs to write your function as off.

75
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.860
No know what I'm doing is I'm trying to divide my logic six lengths off logic into three

76
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.350
parts.

77
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.650
So in first of part I am taking these two lines and I'm implementing in this way the F

78
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.150
welcome message.

79
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.100
That's it.

80
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.300
Then,

81
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.580
inside off this function,

82
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.350
I'm going Teoh,

83
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.290
right?

84
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.750
These two life lines,

85
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.420
right?

86
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.800
Finally,

87
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.030
hard,

88
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.330
right?

89
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.950
Return None.

90
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.650
Then I'm going to defend one more function that is supposed known concepts.

91
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.900
That's a then whatever the lines you have in your known concerts up with these two lines

92
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.700
for my known concepts.

93
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.390
Logic.

94
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.320
Just a junction,

95
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.620
Nothing.

96
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.450
Is that how you can can what they were calling toe functions.

97
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.710
So for that,

98
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.910
just I'm giving idea return none.

99
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.000
And we hold 12 more lines for these two more lines.

100
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.010
What I'm doing is I'm going to the white again that I suppose new concept are lending

101
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:25.350
concepts like we takes up with new concepts That's a like and finally just right.

102
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.630
A return?

103
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.210
None.

104
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.840
So now what?

105
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.640
Our the logic.

106
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.940
You How that logic?

107
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.190
No,

108
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.050
I'm implementing in terms of functions.

109
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.650
And I'm running this.

110
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.560
No,

111
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.500
but we know that if we defined simply function,

112
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.650
you won't get any or put to get up the output.

113
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.550
What are the output you need that particular function unit toe call.

114
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.950
Right.

115
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.750
See,

116
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.660
Suppose I want to get known concept Elastico put.

117
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.510
Then I will call in this way function name parenthesis that say that Miranda didn't see the

118
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.450
output you're getting.

119
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.560
But actually,

120
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.320
I need to get first these two lights,

121
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.390
then these two.

122
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.650
Then these two in the same order you just to call your functions.

123
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.710
Very first.

124
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.350
You just to call your function.

125
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.130
Ah,

126
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.880
that function eyes Welcome.

127
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.670
Message then.

128
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.530
Last one new concept.

129
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.990
That's it.

130
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.470
Luckily,

131
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.430
Randy can sit output.

132
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.740
Yes,

133
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.850
you're getting no what we d What?

134
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.140
I would the logic you how,

135
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.250
But actually this logic consists off three.

136
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.240
Uh,

137
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.270
but this I'm was you mean 1st 2 are something like Welcome,

138
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.650
miss a second do or something like known concert logic start last two are for new concepts

139
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.650
.

140
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.690
Logic based on that,

141
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.820
just have given some names and I I'm calling them right.

142
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.380
So that is if we change this order.

143
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.020
This function is called the way How you're calling this order,

144
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.400
you will get based on that are running.

145
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.550
You'll get output right on.

146
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.810
One more thing is see if I remove these three functions Names to call.

147
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.300
You were defined a function.

148
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.410
You're not getting over by running that court.

149
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.550
The reason is,

150
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.150
but what if you run your core Python will run from top to down.

151
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.760
Why?

152
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.630
Learning from top to down whenever there is a d e f t word are there time your fight and

153
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.960
wounding scored that logic or block off court,

154
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.500
which is there under your function?

155
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.550
Simply your python will remember the name off your function.

156
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.830
Same way Felt that all places Yes,

157
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.690
indeedy off.

158
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.630
There is no straightforward line or mainline.

159
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.280
That's why you're not getting in or put.

160
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.340
But if I write in this way now,

161
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.520
only this party's defining your function.

162
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.040
Now that you're calling so your line off I mean your execution part will start from 13th

163
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.350
line.

164
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.850
So from this you're fightin will go here and like school here and we come back.

165
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.260
So after that line,

166
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.550
in case if you are one more function are same function.

167
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.850
Maybe in case if you want.

168
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.150
Oh,

169
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.880
our print Welcome,

170
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.890
Mrs Two times.

171
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.340
Yes.

172
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.970
No problem.

173
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.710
You can print it.

174
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.950
No.

175
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.650
See the result.

176
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.990
Sometimes you are getting,

177
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.810
but I want only one time.

178
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.120
Yeah,

179
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.750
no problem.

180
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.630
That's it.

181
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.840
No,

182
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.980
See,

183
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.800
that is a Okay.

184
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.310
So they suggest I'm trying to give some Worrell idea in case already VR some logic in your

185
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.680
hand.

186
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.450
How to convert that into in terms of functions.

187
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.250
Right.

188
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.750
So well,

189
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.850
going forward will discuss in detail about you are different types of functions and where

190
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.920
we're going to discuss able to use our different functions but didn't function.

191
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.560
Salary would become something like list in the length,

192
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.960
right?

193
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.140
Idee car.

194
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.180
Something like the default functions,

195
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.880
which which are defined with your pipe.

196
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.550
Now we're trying to define our own defined function user defined forms,

197
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.950
and we are defining when we're calling them.

198
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.950
Right.

199
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.970
Okay.

200
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.890
Guys will see.

201
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.220
Indeed,

202
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.750
ill will going for more.

203
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.530
Okay.

204
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.950
Thank you for watching this with you.
