1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
friends here.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,560
We're going to discuss a vote.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,870
Functions with arguments on Britain value.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,180
See,

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,460
Ali,

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,250
we have seen how to send arguments to your functions.

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,190
Now,

8
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,950
what we're going to do is along with your arguments,

9
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,670
how you can get a written.

10
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,250
Where you from your function.

11
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,220
That's what we're going to discuss here,

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,280
right?

13
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,480
Let me take an example to give this Ah,

14
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,510
explanation.

15
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:38,300
I'm going toe sale a bite on skip name as functions with arguments on return values dark be

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,660
like So again,

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,250
Let me take simple example because we are an initial stage,

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,100
right?

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,410
So I'm taking simply a reason off two numbers.

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,130
So once again,

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,190
I'm writing court from scratch.

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,050
I mean,

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,050
first,

24
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:02,350
I will write your core with told functions so that you will get some idea how to implement

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,750
your functions.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,350
Right then.

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,950
Beak was too input and that he was second number.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,460
That's it.

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,210
No,

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,200
we know if you want to find the addition off these two variables,

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,440
right?

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,250
Let's say a result I'm taking it was two year place be.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,750
And then I am printing.

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,650
So the traditional you are here.

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,850
All right,

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,440
be he's You're simply what result?

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,280
That's it right.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,410
Let me open my command line.

39
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,870
Now we know.

40
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,400
Script us this one.

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,860
No,

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,950
Let me run this.

43
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,060
I'm gonna bring number four or number five.

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,450
You're getting results as line,

45
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,830
but same skipped.

46
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,350
I want implement in terms off functions.

47
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:09,350
So what I'm going to do Ease reading to numbers year and be I want toe right under main

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,850
function.

49
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,340
Not only main days,

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,380
you can take anything,

51
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,500
but if you take main somewhat meaning we're going to start our court from this.

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,800
Fine.

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,150
That's it,

54
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,970
right?

55
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,300
I so get addition.

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm defending one more function,

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,240
right?

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,450
So here I'm using simply these two lines.

59
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:43,370
Just let me arrange indentations properly,

60
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,850
then return none.

61
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,890
That's fine.

62
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,380
No,

63
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,050
I'm running nor put.

64
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,590
You're not getting old port.

65
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,410
The reason is you're not calling your main function by only main function.

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,120
We have to call because we had to start our court from this line.

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,290
That's why this court is there under this function.

68
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,510
No,

69
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,000
I need to call that function.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,350
Right.

71
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,550
Let me call it main.

72
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,350
That's a right.

73
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,780
So if you call this main function what your fight on will go,

74
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,790
it will come from two.

75
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,600
Here then video and beat them return.

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,050
None means I had to come back to here.

77
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,390
But nowhere.

78
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,240
We're calling this If you call this,

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,950
then only these two leads will exclude so that we can see the result.

80
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,310
So after reading your numbers in your main function just to call these two,

81
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,900
I mean this function while calling the function right.

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,610
So we are using functions.

83
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,060
You A and B are violent only in this main function.

84
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,520
So how you can get a year and be valleys in get addition function while calling that you

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,540
can pass you what a comma be You can also take yeti A comma be Are you sure?

86
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,290
Off Become a beacon Take some become a que Also on here If you take become a que unity

87
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,220
replace in your get rich in function these places I mean,

88
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:12,580
whatever we hold I let's a year on B this year on be suppose if I take your pick a mock you

89
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,250
then I need to replace year and be with become a que in this angelozzi.

90
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,350
But even though if you take you come a bit no problem,

91
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,730
because this year and be I mean six cents.

92
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,210
17

93
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,850
Whatever you how year and be there are different from your year and be rich are defining

94
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,250
your get tradition function,

95
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,280
even though names are same,

96
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,380
even though names are saying they are under the different function.

97
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,030
So the variables are different.

98
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,440
Only the year value is mapping toe this one be valleys mapping.

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,030
Did this one?

100
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,150
So here you can take anything that's fine.

101
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,120
No,

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,780
we have our core just to get original two numbers.

103
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,550
Let me around your court.

104
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,460
I'm running so like let's say enter for and fight.

105
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,750
You're getting results as line.

106
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,950
That's fine.

107
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,270
Up to know we know.

108
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,890
So here what we are doing simply were passing arguments.

109
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,840
So you are called function on here this year and be our core basically this year and be

110
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,300
this year,

111
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,550
and we bought our variables only.

112
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,110
But more specifically,

113
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,990
hard to say.

114
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,150
These two are arguments these two are.

115
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,750
Parameters are traditional arguments.

116
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,050
Parameters are traditional arguments.

117
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,200
That's fine.

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,100
No,

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,750
actually,

120
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,460
I am printing the result off your ear and be reserved in inside off my function itself.

121
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,450
But now I don't want to print here.

122
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:41,860
I want to print it that reserved only in main function just to get the additional fear and

123
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,700
be I'm using this function but I want to print the results from your main function itself.

124
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,970
Let's say after calling your get traditionally a comma be I mean after completion off this

125
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,380
logic result a come of a plus B If I try to print the result from here the addition off you

126
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:13,130
were year on and be he's I'm reading simply result here But if I say in this way,

127
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,120
what will happen?

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,690
Just observe that this is your court,

129
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,350
right?

130
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,720
You're calling main function Be clear gaze you're calling main function Your floor of

131
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,710
control comes here Then you are reading a value than your reading Be valued and you are

132
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,960
calling this function your flow off control goes to hear You are finding this already a

133
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,450
plus B on you're excluding return In return you are sending your Custer back toe this line

134
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:45,060
Then you are printing this video This line something so raw and so then written on it will

135
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,150
come back to here so that your court is going to execute on it is going to company,

136
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,250
right?

137
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,810
But if I run days,

138
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,700
see the result,

139
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,040
you're getting another call.

140
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,480
Result is not defined white,

141
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,750
because do we have any dessert variable inside off main function?

142
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,250
Know where we are reserved?

143
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,330
How come it will bring the are It's not possible right without having variable how you can

144
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,650
bring.

145
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,890
Of course,

146
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,510
the desert is there in this function,

147
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,380
but we know if any variable is defined inside off a function that is specific to that

148
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,790
function only right that is local toe that function.

149
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,150
You can't access that outside off your function.

150
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,570
So if you want black sis outside off a function where you defend your variable,

151
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,890
you need to make it as a global.

152
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,220
But globally is not a good practice.

153
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,350
We'll see about it,

154
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,450
then how you can send that result back to your main function,

155
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,150
right?

156
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,710
Just forget about your programming.

157
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,440
I suppose you have a question called y equals to some FX,

158
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,920
just as you now,

159
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,050
if affects is a function,

160
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,850
just a junior for fixes some X squared plus three x place to something like that,

161
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,180
and you can take any expression and based on some X value,

162
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,680
you're going to get some result.

163
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,760
That means suppose therefore to let's say for taking place off exiles up shooting too to

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,850
square 44 plus 6 10 10 plus two Tool to will your assignment away right?

165
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,520
Why you close to your fourth to Ming's function?

166
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:25,340
Result your ascendant away right now You know what Programming also same concept What is

167
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,880
the function?

168
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:33,360
Result this variable that very well this function this function result I need to assigned

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,920
to some variable Let's say I'm taking variable called result only you can take any variable

170
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,020
I'm taking result only.

171
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,600
But be clear This result is in your main function on this resort is in get tradition

172
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,150
function there are completely different right?

173
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,490
But what I want raised Why calling this function?

174
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,450
You may get some result like that result I want to assign So this variable that's it.

175
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:05,320
It is only because to get additional fee a comma be Lizardi cause toe from this function.

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,120
Whatever the result,

177
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,940
you are getting that result I want to assign to this variable called result right,

178
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,800
but absurd output first if I run,

179
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,050
you are getting result as what happened Are he s you already?

180
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,510
Maybe I did not say what this court let me say with No,

181
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,250
I sailed that.

182
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,880
So you're getting none,

183
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,220
actually.

184
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Should get seven rate.

185
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,120
You're getting none.

186
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,500
The reason is what our the function you're using that function result you're getting here,

187
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,550
that result you need to send back to this position.

188
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,930
So to send you a result from this function toe this place we are using return we are

189
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,540
sending,

190
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,180
we're sending.

191
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,720
But what we're sending none.

192
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,850
That's why you're getting results as none but what I want to sign.

193
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,560
If you don't have any requirement to send from your function,

194
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,540
then only take none.

195
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,280
Otherwise,

196
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,400
what is the value you are expecting from your function that you need to mention here?

197
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,990
Return results?

198
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,920
What are the result?

199
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,350
You're getting that value,

200
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,140
not a variable.

201
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,780
Be clear.

202
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,280
You're sending only value off this result you are sending that value off reserved this

203
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,490
result of written All right,

204
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:18,950
then,

205
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,660
floor of control.

206
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,510
We come to this position because off redone.

207
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,110
But while coming back what you're carrying that result the value off these that value you

208
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,850
are placing here so that that little bear so into results simple.

209
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,020
CJ's be clear.

210
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,420
When what if you run your core,

211
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,980
you know this is a main function.

212
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,690
These are some very is some function that is some function your fight and won't execute.

213
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,510
That's off now it will simply remember this name.

214
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,250
That's fine.

215
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,400
No,

216
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,210
that is the main logic in your cool.

217
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,390
You're trying to execute this right now.

218
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:59,100
Your floor off bundle comes to here then very first line you're reading year and be then

219
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
resorted He caused to get additionally comma be crisis,

220
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,410
right?

221
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:02,590
Why?

222
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,150
Because of some three plus two.

223
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,900
What is the priority here?

224
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,350
1st 3 plus two will be Emily attack.

225
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,000
That result will be assigned away Same way I have written here.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,550
Resulted coast to get our dictionary Com A B So first this function result will be

227
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,400
calculator.

228
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,860
So to get there,

229
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,350
a reason function is there Here,

230
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,680
your partner will come to hear it will find result and then we'll come back Well,

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,350
coming back.

232
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,730
What you're sending returned result the value which is there in result that value you're

233
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,650
sending back.

234
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,380
So that means finally in place off these you are getting this result variable Whatever

235
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,920
you're writing,

236
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,790
return some variable.

237
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,450
That value will be assigned to this reserve.

238
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,950
Right,

239
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,030
But be clear This result on this result there is no relationship.

240
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,980
Only the value off this result will be assigned to this reserve.

241
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,520
So variables in a different functions.

242
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,860
Even though if you are same names,

243
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,510
they are different right now let me let me know you're going to get woman still none is

244
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,850
that Yeah.

245
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,250
I did not say these Big Abdullah here there is a dot here.

246
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,280
So dark means that you did not say that.

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,250
Let me say it first.

248
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,040
No,

249
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,450
I see you Let me run it.

250
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,130
You're getting There is no foreign fighters nine from very are getting from Maine

251
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,240
functionally right,

252
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,770
So not only main function if you want to send the result or some particular value from your

253
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,650
function from where it is calling.

254
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,750
So actually you are calling this function from here.

255
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,130
No,

256
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,070
I need to replace some value here from the after accomplishing off this function.

257
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,120
So that's what you are right here in your function.

258
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,360
If you write returned results,

259
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,790
that result will be commonplace year so that that you were assigned with this we're able So

260
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:58,250
there's a simple way toe send a result or any value or return value from your function.

261
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,410
That's a right.

262
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,650
Let me define one more are stripped here so that you know you'll get clarity.

263
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:14,640
What I want to do is I had to really number then I want to find suppose but that number How

264
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,750
do my to play with 10?

265
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,660
All right,

266
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,280
multiplication by 10.

267
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,150
I want to do with the help of some function.

268
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,020
But inside of a function I don't want to print my result I need to send that result to my

269
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,390
main function in Maine.

270
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,550
Functionality to print out.

271
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,620
Right?

272
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,250
See that?

273
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,450
Let me start from here onwards,

274
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:33,760
guys,

275
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,340
if you want to write a court for simply right may like so that is the execution point

276
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,460
starting execution point from where you are going to exclude your court.

277
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,380
Then some very harder defined Your main function right now Let me really a number.

278
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:56,450
Let me take number equals two input and that you were number.

279
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,350
That's it.

280
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,450
No,

281
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,320
I want to get some results.

282
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,490
What is my result?

283
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,690
Mighty play number,

284
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,250
even number with sometimes just just just simple example,

285
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,450
right.

286
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,570
So multiplying number with it in for that function.

287
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,540
I need to send what are the number in my hand.

288
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:24,340
I am Certainly now just to go a bow on defined a function call multi play No,

289
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,460
with the pen.

290
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:32,670
Whatever the number you are sending right from here that number should store somewhere here

291
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,450
with some respite to some variable.

292
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,370
So I can take value not only value even it can take same variable.

293
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,010
No problem.

294
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,410
But if it takes aim variable,

295
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,250
you may get confused but if you want to take no problem,

296
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,550
you can take it right now What I'm taking is then I'm finding result equals two.

297
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,520
You want value important Then finally I'm sending return,

298
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,960
not result So that what will happen What are the value?

299
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,070
You are getting that value into 10 That result I'm sending back that means in place off

300
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,280
this.

301
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,670
Finally,

302
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,250
you're getting your number into 10.

303
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:17,540
Now I will print the result here in Maine funding itself the result e simply am printing

304
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,250
You were reserved.

305
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,050
That's a wait.

306
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,830
Let me honey,

307
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,640
I am certain things up with seven.

308
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,650
Your getting 70.

309
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:31,560
There's one more thing here I am finding dessert and then I'm sending that result,

310
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,850
right?

311
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,390
Not only that,

312
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,950
see?

313
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,050
Definitely I can return with your expression as well.

314
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,820
Return value into tell.

315
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,500
No problem.

316
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
What will happen?

317
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,750
You're valuing toe 10 that you are sending back.

318
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,880
So this value will come on.

319
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
Replace this value this value Well,

320
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,950
come on.

321
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,840
Assigning place off this for your variable.

322
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,260
That's it.

323
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,820
That is that uses off return keyword in your function.

324
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,370
If you want to send any value from that function,

325
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,380
do from where it is called to place that place.

326
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,880
If you want to send your value,

327
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,450
then you can take return your key word.

328
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,900
So if you're expecting some value back from your function whenever if you're calling,

329
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,340
then with help off writable only you can get that butler variable value to this position if

330
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,790
you don't.

331
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,950
I mean,

332
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,010
if you are not expecting Justin berated and none,

333
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,450
that's it.

334
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,750
Okay.

335
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,830
So,

336
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,240
guys,

337
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,390
this is the simple way to understand about return value.

338
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,150
Right?

339
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,120
So please do practice was first.

340
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,330
Whatever we are doing in our decision same thing.

341
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,170
First practice.

342
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:39,750
Anyway,

343
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,260
we're going forward step by step.

344
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,430
We will write some real transcripts as well,

345
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,960
so that you will be good with the uses off your functions.

346
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Okay.

347
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,610
Okay,

348
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:48,890
guys,

349
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,310
Thank you for watching this radio
