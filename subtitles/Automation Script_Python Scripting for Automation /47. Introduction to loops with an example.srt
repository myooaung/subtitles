1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
prints here.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,950
We're going to write one more python script,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,430
require Mundy's really directory part,

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,790
and then identify all files and directories in the given part.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,250
Say simply,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,850
our script should read some part.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,690
That a cripple.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,780
So in that location,

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,850
in that given part,

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,850
what are all directors and finds are there,

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,990
right?

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,880
I want to display all those things by mentioning disease.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,260
Your file.

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,380
Um,

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,190
this is a territory.

16
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,800
Every take one simple location.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,290
Oh,

18
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:36,650
yeah.

19
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,210
See here I have no problem.

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,650
This has a part to might buy.

21
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,160
Transcript.

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,970
Then my pie transcript has to display my directory.

23
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,090
Either that every new text document is it filed.

24
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,450
XtraJet is a file.

25
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,340
Your script he's able to identify it has to display.

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,430
This is a territory.

27
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,900
And this is a file on.

28
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,850
This is also your fight,

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,270
right?

30
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,090
Let me go on right one by one.

31
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,090
For time being,

32
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,010
what I'm doing is let me remove one file here just for simplicity.

33
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,750
Purpose finally will like it.

34
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,770
Let me save it.

35
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:16,100
Read apart a 95 files under,

36
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,750
please.

37
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,650
Fine.

38
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,280
See you.

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,760
There's for something.

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,250
We need to read a part,

41
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,380
right?

42
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,340
So to really apart.

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,140
Because parties a string in Europe.

44
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,950
Eitan you how input to read any strength and Terry work directory,

45
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,550
but not you.

46
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,300
After leading that park.

47
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,240
First of all,

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,250
I want to display all the list off files and directories in the given location.

49
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,790
Right.

50
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,760
If you remember,

51
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,630
there is operation from your waist model.

52
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,290
That is ways dot listed Matic,

53
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:56,820
please.

54
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,510
So now here I have a requirement with ways module.

55
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,720
That's why I'm importing voice now.

56
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,950
Simply am branding.

57
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,070
Where's door?

58
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,430
Listen directory And whatever the part you're providing that.

59
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,290
But I am taking right.

60
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,290
Let me go toe my Come on line from there.

61
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,850
I want to run because I need to probably just part right.

62
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,050
So our script location is in this somewhere.

63
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,840
First,

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,350
let me open you r script.

65
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,030
This is your script only.

66
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,930
We have three lines.

67
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,240
First,

68
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,510
Lenny's your important ways.

69
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,220
Model to second line.

70
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,810
You are going to read from your command line your part hard line in the given part,

71
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,350
you're going to list out all the directories and files.

72
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,560
Let me do it right on.

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,700
I want to provide a part.

74
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,550
Let me take this as my part on embroiling.

75
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,430
See,

76
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,870
guys,

77
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,430
this script will work both.

78
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,930
You are windows as well as UNIX like systems,

79
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,010
but way providing.

80
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,250
But on Windows operating system,

81
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,260
you have to provide two slices in a part.

82
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,750
Sida slash housing slash nobody thought appropriate to slash is just toe a white.

83
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,550
But nobody feels some special characters in your part,

84
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,010
right?

85
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,850
Only whenever.

86
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,860
If you're providing manually at that time only or to provide fine,

87
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,650
no seat output.

88
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,810
This part,

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,700
whatever you're providing that is going to store in this variable and I'm listing Where's

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,250
that part that up always dauntless directory in your party.

91
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,840
So in this location,

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,930
I want to list all the directories and files on this output is a list.

93
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,880
See that already we have seen in Norway's mortal explanation,

94
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,250
this is always a list.

95
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,020
No,

96
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,450
you're getting two files.

97
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,030
One is directory on one.

98
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,310
What is fighting but mighty Clementi's.

99
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,780
If I get some values in a given part,

100
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,150
I mean,

101
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,910
some files under these are pythons capacitor display.

102
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,420
This is a territory,

103
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,610
and this is a file,

104
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,900
right?

105
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,990
So you know,

106
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,430
if you know the path,

107
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,380
if you know the part off your file,

108
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,260
then you can find out whether this is a file or not using you up.

109
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,500
Where's dark path?

110
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,570
Dot is file is directly.

111
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,850
You can take anyone off that operation if remember,

112
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,850
a B before going toe.

113
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,940
Check whether it is a file or not.

114
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,740
First of all,

115
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,980
you should How in your hand your complete part Off your file.

116
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,750
Order three.

117
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,790
Otherwise,

118
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,990
you will get another because you're skipping or running from this location.

119
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,950
But these files are little different location.

120
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,420
Right?

121
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,910
See that?

122
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,450
Suppose if I do simply.

123
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,100
Yeah.

124
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,190
One more thing before that,

125
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,010
let me store this output into one variable file,

126
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,340
son,

127
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,850
that at least files on direct with list.

128
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,810
That's a no.

129
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,860
I can also print in this way.

130
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,100
Right,

131
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,820
Right.

132
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,950
Let me read in your court.

133
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,490
So this is your court now?

134
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,450
I'm going to read on that.

135
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,480
I'm going to provide the spot.

136
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,250
Yes.

137
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,750
Same what we are getting because of this print line.

138
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,430
So in this very well.

139
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,500
Now we have these two things as of no gym,

140
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,330
that but all the part you're going to provide in that party,

141
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:23,990
how any two fights or any two directories are any one directly in one fight Now to identify

142
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,870
this is a file or not on this is a file or not.

143
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,470
First of all,

144
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,140
I have to separate this value from this list.

145
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,450
Right?

146
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,280
So that's why one I'm taking is I'm creating two parts.

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,540
No,

148
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,900
let me come and dislike but one.

149
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,230
Let me take the one part One equals two from your this list index zero.

150
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,550
I'm storing into part one.

151
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,790
But the two equals two from your this one.

152
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,550
Index one,

153
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,750
right?

154
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,720
No,

155
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,050
I want to identify whether p one is it.

156
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,550
That'll be one easy file or not for a lot directly.

157
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,910
Guys,

158
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,840
let me do it as body without port.

159
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,860
People use a file,

160
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,130
right?

161
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,660
So because second value is a file index one value,

162
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,900
let me check it first on your people if even,

163
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,430
you know,

164
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,270
in our previous example Also we have seen Where's that part that is fighting people that I

165
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,810
can say you are free to Sorry.

166
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,430
Hiding the body.

167
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,040
Happy to write.

168
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,950
We're working on Peter.

169
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,810
We do is fight else.

170
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,900
If that is false,

171
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,910
where's dot partner is file?

172
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,600
Maybe.

173
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,050
Peter,

174
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,940
that your file?

175
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,350
You know,

176
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,900
if you know exactly you can say that there is a file other ways.

177
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,620
That is a directory,

178
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:45,850
right?

179
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:56,840
That I can see you're free to is a direct Let me save it on Goto Common line.

180
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,230
And then really were script ones.

181
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,520
Let me when you're stupid.

182
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,220
No,

183
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,980
I'm providing some.

184
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,730
But c x wagered dot as such is a day three or getting.

185
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,750
But that is not correct.

186
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,050
The reason is why you are getting peace.

187
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,010
Actually,

188
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,520
Peter means X with your daughter.

189
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
Such your python skip,

190
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,200
you're running from different location on your files are there in a different location.

191
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,620
That's right.

192
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,800
Whenever if you're running any part three little operation,

193
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,240
you should get in your hand complete.

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,700
But as of now,

195
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,110
you don't know complete part X ray.

196
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,950
It is there somewhere in different location.

197
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,150
But I don't know how complete part for that,

198
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,250
right?

199
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,350
What is a complete part?

200
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,170
Complete but is nothing but in the given location.

201
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,690
In this given location,

202
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,350
your file is there then,

203
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,930
for this location at the end.

204
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,740
At the end,

205
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,550
if you are x rayed your daughter such then that is the complete part for this file,

206
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,240
right?

207
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,650
So that's your to create first how you can create it,

208
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:09,990
see if you remember who is dot path dot Join You were given part comma.

209
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,300
You were filed so that you're going to create a complete part.

210
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,810
Your file.

211
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,630
See,

212
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,800
let me print your part.

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,550
Only part.

214
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,670
I'm bringing on the paedophile.

215
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,190
Let me come and they will remain in court Now See,

216
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,450
that would put what you're going to get.

217
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,190
I'm running.

218
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,920
You're getting complete part for your file?

219
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,190
No,

220
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,310
once if we get complete part guys,

221
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,270
complete party nothing.

222
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,940
But you were given a part in that part you're having explained your daughter such That's

223
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,450
what you heard These two things.

224
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,540
You can get comfort but your X rays your daughter such only given.

225
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:48,030
But if we are those two things you will get complete part for your file so that you can

226
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,000
directly respect you off your operating system who are two parts you can use directly waste

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,170
are part or join.

228
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,870
That's what I did not only for Peter O.

229
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,220
P.

230
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,410
One.

231
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,160
Also you have to do not only for that pile if how multiple things for all things you ought

232
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,810
to do in this way only faster fall you have to create complete part.

233
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,850
For they were fighting.

234
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,430
That's why I am big near part.

235
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,880
Only because there is a part.

236
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,050
You're profiting as input.

237
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,740
In their part,

238
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,890
only you file your file,

239
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,230
is there.

240
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,900
That's what you heard.

241
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,850
Those two things you can get complete part.

242
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,450
Fine.

243
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,650
Now run your script.

244
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,120
Now I'm going to come.

245
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,990
And they were two files.

246
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,250
Life?

247
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,630
No.

248
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,790
See that as off?

249
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,150
No.

250
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,510
I have a felt condition only for Peter Park.

251
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,150
Let me very fat that whether Peter is working perfectly or not,

252
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,940
this is the part.

253
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,510
Yes.

254
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,320
Easy a file.

255
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,850
You are getting same.

256
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,380
Lousy.

257
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,660
I need to play for pure notes.

258
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,030
Right.

259
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,380
Then what?

260
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,950
I ought to go.

261
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,750
Let me copy this logic once again and try to play for people.

262
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:56,050
See that I'm trying to play for people.

263
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,870
So what will happen if this is the file?

264
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,250
This will become crew else Falls Falls means you're going to split this one.

265
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,800
Guys,

266
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,880
in your previous script,

267
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,790
we also used ways dot path,

268
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,950
dot exist.

269
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,530
But here known it off that because if given parties vital part,

270
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,740
that only are going to get list off files list off calories into this DF underscore.

271
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,100
Riel,

272
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,700
variable.

273
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,380
If you provide a valid parts then Only right that only we're going to get it if you want.

274
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:35,380
But I defer to severely gonna play If ways dot part dot exists If you in part is a valid

275
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:35,950
apart,

276
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,710
then only I can find a list off their descent fires in the given thing.

277
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:53,890
Otherwise I can buy else it's bring please provide a valid but right And one more thing

278
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,160
Anyway,

279
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,050
it's timeto give that as well.

280
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,040
If parties invalid,

281
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,050
you're not going to get this list.

282
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,350
If you're not going to get displaced,

283
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,230
how can How can you create the one we do?

284
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,250
You can create that,

285
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:06,750
Troy.

286
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,350
If this part is not existing,

287
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,520
you are to print this information on.

288
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,950
You should not exclude the score.

289
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,520
If you're excluding this quarter means you got your DF underscore.

290
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:16,750
Riel,

291
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,220
variable.

292
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,960
No,

293
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,240
you're not getting if parties invalid.

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,060
You can't get this because this is a false right we don't have in your list.

295
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,540
How can you use in your core?

296
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,130
That's why you ought to stop your script to stop your script.

297
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,510
You have a syntax courses,

298
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,110
not exit.

299
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,620
Now we are using six module.

300
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,190
So you are the important that So we thought This is not exit.

301
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,780
If I run my court sit output how you're going to get you'll get another?

302
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,550
See that in general I'm giving invalid apart.

303
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:56,260
See if it is involved Part you are not getting the FL If you're not getting DFL,

304
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,770
how can you get from that index?

305
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,250
Jiro,

306
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,630
you can't create people right apart on your counter create by taking next judo from your

307
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,030
variable if given parties,

308
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,450
please probable party are getting that means given parties invalid If it is invalid,

309
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,250
you can't get this one.

310
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,850
The reason is if it is invalid part,

311
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,390
this will become fault if it is false.

312
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,850
There is no way to create your dear from the school.

313
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,320
If there is no dear friend,

314
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,520
ask Auriol How can you can't take people?

315
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,880
Pito,

316
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,550
How can you create pure and Peter from these dear friend of school?

317
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,760
You run out there.

318
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,250
That's why I need to stop my script.

319
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:38,950
If it is valued part then only any to run my scrip.

320
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,020
So if it is valued your if condition will become to this valley will exclude on anyway.

321
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,420
If this is true,

322
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,750
you know that else is going toe skip by your pipe.

323
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,970
No,

324
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,330
see,

325
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,110
same court.

326
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,250
I'm running and I'm providing involved part.

327
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,910
Now,

328
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,370
we're not getting an error in job that you're getting simply.

329
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,050
Please provide valid part.

330
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,340
Okay,

331
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,940
It's good,

332
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,630
because here we got one more concept.

333
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,850
How to use is not exit.

334
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,250
That's fine.

335
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,890
Now let me run this court and I'm going to probably valued part.

336
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,890
No.

337
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,930
See that in that part?

338
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,740
This is a territory.

339
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:14,980
Yes,

340
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,610
you're getting through.

341
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,650
Python is a territory on this you're getting is a fight.

342
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,750
All right,

343
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,850
fine.

344
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,470
So we're creating people and Peter aren't.

345
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,150
We are taking one Ifill's condition for people,

346
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,350
but the one on second defense condition for part two.

347
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,300
And here there is a very big desert foundation.

348
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,900
What is that means as off?

349
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,380
No.

350
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,780
In the given location,

351
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,960
you have only two files.

352
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,850
That's why I'm taking part one part two.

353
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,830
But as you know,

354
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,350
you don't know how many files under trees are there in the given directly part.

355
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,450
Let me do one thing.

356
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm I'm building this fight.

357
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,130
No,

358
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,250
I'm going to run your script,

359
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,950
right?

360
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,450
See the result?

361
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,710
You're getting another listing.

362
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,690
Next order off range.

363
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,750
The reason is.

364
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,520
Let me bring the first you are because,

365
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,360
as I have No,

366
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,250
You're having only one item in a given location.

367
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:19,930
See?

368
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,470
That are put right.

369
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,630
One of the data trees there.

370
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,670
That's where the next June.

371
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,680
Next one is not there,

372
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,710
but for Peter You're using in next one.

373
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,240
Then your step is wrong,

374
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,550
right?

375
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,050
Ordell's I will do one more thing.

376
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,050
Ah,

377
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,550
I was cleared some random files.

378
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:39,880
Here,

379
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,150
let me create some files here.

380
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,260
Ah,

381
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,780
that ex door Txt.

382
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,740
Why not be way some dead guard message right now.

383
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,190
I get it.

384
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,050
Three files here.

385
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,910
I created three files.

386
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,430
No,

387
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,460
for the same part.

388
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,570
One second I'm running your pie,

389
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,130
conscript.

390
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,130
Try to understand days now you how,

391
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,360
actually four items in the park.

392
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,500
But your script is giving about only two parts actually having four values,

393
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,850
right?

394
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,460
But it's kept.

395
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,440
Your script is saying only about two information to items,

396
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,750
too.

397
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,110
Parts from your given location.

398
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,800
Then what about remaining yet?

399
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,070
Why it is giving only two means as off No,

400
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,740
in ERP items could be how taken care only for pure and we do so now You have a problem with

401
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,250
the script.

402
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,520
If you're given location is not having two parts.

403
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,650
Then you're skip is going to give another are if it is having more number off files and

404
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,860
that it isn't a given location.

405
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,150
Then you're skipping is not able to identify all it is going to add If I identify only two

406
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:55,480
That means based on how many files Underdressed are there in a given location based on

407
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,450
their dynamically or skipped has to work.

408
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,250
That is not happening with this cream.

409
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,670
Then how you can be then how you can do it?

410
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,430
That's important thing right now Let me come in this court as off No,

411
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,260
Whatever you have,

412
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,310
I will come in the entire court first.

413
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,010
Be clear,

414
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,280
guys.

415
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,870
It's very,

416
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,150
very useful in your real time concept.

417
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:24,730
I'm reading something Text Gays don't worry of order.

418
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,250
Just try to understand output.

419
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:33,830
I'm writing for each in 234 Then I'm writing.

420
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,300
Drink.

421
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,250
Okay then drink.

422
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,150
Hi.

423
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,520
First of all,

424
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,170
assume that this is like if condition you know,

425
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,040
intensive reserve condition.

426
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
If your condition is true,

427
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
then you're going to execute these two lines.

428
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,850
If it is ive condition on what are the conditions you here If that is true.

429
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,500
Then you're going to feel these two lines ones.

430
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,880
But this is not condition.

431
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,850
This is called a loop this year for for his collar loop.

432
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,900
What is the use off loop means big.

433
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,280
Clear,

434
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,350
Because off this look,

435
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,060
what are the values are sorry.

436
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,260
Whatever the lines you have under your loop,

437
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,260
those lines will repeat some separate number off times are getting like in immediately.

438
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,590
But how many number of times you're going toe your loop is going to repeat these two lines

439
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,410
means how many values you have here,

440
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,160
that the number of times these two lines will execute.

441
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,210
Right?

442
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,810
See that first let me on this score and sit output here.

443
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,430
I hear itself.

444
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,490
I am running because I'm not drawing an input.

445
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,160
I can run it from sublime takes itself.

446
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,800
You have 2343 values in your list,

447
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,130
right?

448
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,850
That's why.

449
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,540
Okay,

450
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,910
High that is one output,

451
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,160
second time or port?

452
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,050
Third time or put.

453
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:59,040
So you have dourness and fasting for is some look Luke means you know,

454
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,700
starting point.

455
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,420
An important same,

456
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,660
right?

457
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,160
So you are You are reporting here and here and here only.

458
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,850
That's right.

459
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,760
That is called simply look.

460
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,300
Okay,

461
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,060
then whatever the lines are there under your Luke,

462
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,800
those lines are repeating certain number of times immediately.

463
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,700
First time,

464
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,730
second time,

465
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,270
Third time immediately.

466
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,950
It is repeating these two lines but a home a number of times based on here,

467
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,480
whatever you're providing in that harmony,

468
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,850
number of values are there.

469
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,910
If it is a list in trouble,

470
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,180
how many rallies are there?

471
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,550
You can also write some string.

472
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,960
Let me do it.

473
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,450
String here I'm writing simply not end up.

474
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,070
See the airport.

475
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,030
How many characters are then?

476
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,600
A given string that many number of times These two lines will repeat.

477
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,760
I get in again immediately.

478
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,160
Right?

479
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,840
That actually was in practice for this is any variable each each is there?

480
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,050
No,

481
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,790
that is any variable you can take like X ray Jay Peak you are or you're required.

482
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,710
Variable are your name also You can take it that is simply a variable.

483
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,470
Then in the standard t worry hard writing asdis.

484
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:16,500
So here you can write a list are couple or lest string also right.

485
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,410
For time being,

486
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,270
what I'm reading is I'm going to write a list off values.

487
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,720
Four.

488
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:21,890
Well,

489
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,530
is I'm writing.

490
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,160
Then these two lines will repeat four times.

491
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,330
No,

492
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:26,680
it right,

493
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,160
two lanes.

494
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,330
You're gonna 100 lane so I can write simply one lane.

495
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:30,550
Also,

496
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,100
no problem.

497
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,070
Just for our understanding.

498
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,620
But was no I'm writing Hello.

499
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,760
Only one letter I'm writing.

500
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,460
Now.

501
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,570
This line this line will repeat again and again immediately.

502
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,230
Four times.

503
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,550
Because your four values here,

504
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,660
I'm sure that would put first.

505
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,590
Yes,

506
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,850
you are getting no.

507
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,050
You defined somewhere Variable called each right.

508
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,830
Then what did they use off this?

509
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,390
Actually,

510
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,140
that is the very,

511
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,010
very important you.

512
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,080
Whether you're going to use that inside off your for loop or not.

513
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,840
That is your wish.

514
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,450
You can also use that in guess if you have a requirement.

515
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,380
And one more thing,

516
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,790
guys,

517
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,600
you are repeating this lines,

518
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,880
right?

519
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,550
The lines which are there in your loop.

520
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,200
If you repeat once,

521
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,220
then that is called one liberation.

522
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,100
One iteration.

523
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,220
So no,

524
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,030
you can say here we have four values.

525
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,530
That's why you're loop.

526
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,560
Is it rating?

527
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,280
Four times are Your loop is repeating four times the lines which are there.

528
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,550
And they were for Luke.

529
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,760
As I know you have only one.

530
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,290
Bring the straight man un in case if you want to you this variable inside off your loop,

531
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,940
you can use it.

532
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,730
See that what I'm doing is hello,

533
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,250
comma variable,

534
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:41,460
right?

535
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,850
You can print the variable value by using in this way.

536
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,290
No.

537
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,260
If I run this how it is going to execute,

538
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,090
we know four times it is going to exclude because four values are there immediately to like

539
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,930
school four times.

540
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,970
Do that support.

541
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,160
I'm reading here before.

542
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,450
Look,

543
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,350
I'm reading here brain after Luke.

544
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,830
So between this before,

545
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,450
loop after loop printed statements this line will repeat it four times,

546
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,920
like first of the output home.

547
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,660
And And it is going to repeat before loop after loop.

548
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,780
Between that,

549
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,750
you're getting four times you're print.

550
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,160
Hello.

551
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,410
What you are getting each value is different whenever it is repeating first time first

552
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,160
generation,

553
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:37,160
it is value to second generation 3 30 duration four 50 40 Duration 50.

554
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:45,890
Right Then how your loop is working with your variable called each Nothing.

555
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,360
Is there guys how your python is going to explode as of no.

556
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,200
In you escape,

557
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,540
you have only four lights are three lines.

558
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,160
Main lines are three main lines are three.

559
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,050
They are.

560
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,550
Let me take it one by one.

561
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,770
This is first line,

562
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,780
second line,

563
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,470
Charlie.

564
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,560
But this line is under your loop under the order.

565
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,160
Like look this print line,

566
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
right,

567
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,090
Fine.

568
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,450
Then how it is going to exclude means anybody whenever if it only was capable.

569
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,660
Like you're from top down.

570
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,850
So this land legs good first because I've got here getting this output.

571
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,410
Then whenever there is a cure called for,

572
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,450
then your python will assume that this is a loop.

573
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,120
Another python will decide that I need to repeat some lines.

574
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,400
Some number off times so as off No,

575
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,290
under your loopy how only one line Now you're fighting will decide that this line of how

576
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,340
could repeat some number of times.

577
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,950
That number of times are how many values you're having here,

578
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,800
like but how it is going to execute.

579
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,050
So whenever there is a for loop for keyword imminently,

580
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,550
or Peyton will look here,

581
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,970
how many values are how many characters if it is a string?

582
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,610
As of now,

583
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,260
we have a list,

584
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,200
right?

585
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,690
Okay.

586
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,790
Four valleys are there.

587
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,540
Then you're fighting.

588
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,850
It will take for us to value first and this valley will assigned to this variable.

589
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,780
Then after assigning whatever the lines you have under,

590
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,520
they were loop.

591
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,350
Those lines will execute ones.

592
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,810
No.

593
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,020
Well,

594
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,260
excluding what I'm doing,

595
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm printing each wearable also.

596
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,520
Then currently what is each were able to value?

597
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:20,980
That's it.

598
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,660
That's where getting this one so fun situation is war were then you are fight on will

599
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,410
immediately after completion of first generation Who is going to store each?

600
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,450
Then you are repeating this time in your python is excluding this.

601
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,310
Then after completion off this line,

602
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:43,240
your python will go on check immediately the next value What are the next values?

603
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,990
There again,

604
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,890
your pattern will assigned to your each.

605
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,620
Only now you're each wearable is three.

606
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,220
After assigning next to value to your each variable again your pattern leg scored the lines

607
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,760
which are there under it would loop.

608
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,970
But while excluding your printing each No.

609
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,270
Currently,

610
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,450
what is the each one second?

611
00:23:59,450 --> 00:23:59,700
Well,

612
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,910
that's where getting this one.

613
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,650
Okay,

614
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,180
second generation is also over.

615
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,760
Then your fight ultimately will go for third value.

616
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,430
Chervil is formal.

617
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,800
Now this four will assigned to each variable after signing Third World to each then this

618
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,920
logic will repeat third time.

619
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
But while debuting third time,

620
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,620
what is their value for?

621
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,760
That's where getting this one.

622
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,410
Then you'll by then we'll look for fourth value.

623
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:28,870
Yes,

624
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,100
for then four will assigned to each.

625
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,260
Then we'll exclude ones.

626
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,250
My legs good in your printing each also,

627
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,210
that's where getting fight.

628
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,590
Then again,

629
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,300
your pattern will try to look for next value in the given list,

630
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,660
but you don't have next value or already for values are over.

631
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,400
That's why your partner will come out from your loop on.

632
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,860
Let's go.

633
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,790
The next line,

634
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,350
which is the main line in your pipe on court before well is over.

635
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,660
Then the execution part off this line is over.

636
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,470
Then you're biting logo index.

637
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,970
Could this one,

638
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,110
that's we're getting this line,

639
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,950
right?

640
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,610
So,

641
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,290
no,

642
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:10,160
if you have a list off values from the automatically,

643
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,030
you can take one by one value one.

644
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,850
You can print it using your loop.

645
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,150
Now,

646
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:22,280
this concept I'm going to use for our task how means home means into a fighting this logic

647
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,740
Say,

648
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,240
First of all,

649
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,350
let me Corbett this court So previously you're taking only people in Pito.

650
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,880
Only two parts your taking,

651
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,250
but,

652
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,610
you know,

653
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,130
in a given.

654
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,200
But you may have any number off parts.

655
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,550
I'm in files and directories.

656
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,120
That's why don't fix.

657
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
You don't know about that.

658
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,220
But in the part you don't know how many files are there.

659
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,480
How many doctors are there?

660
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,440
How can you say only two parts people?

661
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,750
And Peter that way?

662
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,270
What I'm doing is right.

663
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,230
Let me come in.

664
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,130
This laws Gasol,

665
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,760
this is simple for Lucas.

666
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,470
Okay?

667
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,470
We have different ways.

668
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,000
We will see all those loops in the next section.

669
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,720
I'm importing ways.

670
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,050
Then I'm reading some part after reading part right.

671
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:11,090
I'm getting a list off file Sunday territories every day.

672
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,130
Plenty available ways dot list Barrick,

673
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:15,660
please.

674
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,350
You were given part?

675
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,060
No.

676
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,550
You know,

677
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,450
the result off this operation is always a list That means this variable is the list.

678
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,830
If it is a list,

679
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,110
I can take one by one from they're using for loop.

680
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,260
See that what I'm doing for each fine I'm breaking.

681
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,440
See?

682
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,180
Previously out I can only each while explaining about your look.

683
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,460
But now I'm taking each file based on situation.

684
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,550
You can take any variable.

685
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,220
No,

686
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,790
from this variable list off things.

687
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,090
I'm going to take one by one.

688
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,540
So in that you may have filed similarities,

689
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,190
but I'm taking each file injured.

690
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,020
That each file or directory I can contact.

691
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,790
But don't take this Lenti.

692
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,990
This type of for Lindy variable.

693
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,310
Okay,

694
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,990
for understanding.

695
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,270
But what?

696
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,710
I'm drinking each filer directly from this,

697
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,750
right?

698
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,660
No,

699
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:09,650
you have to go understand that how many times this loop is going to execute the supreme?

700
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,450
The straight man.

701
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,760
You don't know how many times it is going to score.

702
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,990
It is when they exclude based on how many values you are fetching into this variable this

703
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,100
variable deserve you're getting from where is doubtless territory.

704
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,620
That means you're getting this values very was there is er is a war.

705
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,760
Yeah,

706
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,370
this values So in their living a germ,

707
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,230
A list off values in place.

708
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,660
Off this list off files and territories.

709
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,910
So what?

710
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:44,400
Your point on every take retake foster value from this undersigned two days and then to

711
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,440
like school the lines we thought there and they would look for how only one print statement

712
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,050
leg school.

713
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,440
Then your partner will try to take next item from this file laboratory and it will start to

714
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,160
this variable.

715
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,170
And we're printing that.

716
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,570
That's why dynamically automatically,

717
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:05,160
you are going to print all over files or directories from your given location.

718
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,810
No,

719
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,000
you don't need to bother you.

720
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,470
No need to worry about how many files are there.

721
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,180
How many dangers are there automatically or Peyton is going to take care with help off your

722
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,060
loop right now.

723
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,770
Let me go on.

724
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,000
Run your core before that,

725
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,290
Let me weapon your core.

726
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,090
So this is your court?

727
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,290
Simply I'm going to provide some part.

728
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,850
Let me do one thing.

729
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,130
I'm going toe removed.

730
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,710
All empty lines.

731
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:37,470
Let me clearer screen once again.

732
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:37,850
Yeah,

733
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,750
This is your script,

734
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,160
right?

735
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,810
No.

736
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:44,470
I'm going to run your script and I'm going to probably part called New.

737
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:52,530
I don't see the output you're able to display one by one file from your list off values.

738
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,230
If you want to see the list off values,

739
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,430
you can print that as well.

740
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,770
Print all files on direct.

741
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,020
Chris,

742
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,320
you don't know how many files are there on merit is on there,

743
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,090
but that value automatically you're getting with ways dauntless territory into a variable

744
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,660
called list Underscore.

745
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,850
Wave underscore files underscored battery.

746
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,450
Now see the result.

747
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,890
First of all,

748
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,390
you're getting this one from this list automatically.

749
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,180
Your apartment is going to take with help off for Luke one by one.

750
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,040
Value on.

751
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,600
We're printing that one by one value.

752
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,050
But my intention is not displaying simply or one by one value.

753
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,560
If it is a directory I want to display here,

754
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,480
this is a territory.

755
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,130
This is your file.

756
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,730
This is your file.

757
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,350
This is your file.

758
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:43,280
But before going to display before going to check whether that is a file or dietary always

759
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,450
not only here wherever you are using,

760
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,660
you should able to fetch complete part first.

761
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,760
So that's why what I'm doing is before printing,

762
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,850
I'm going to create the one variable called What?

763
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,140
That would dig file or directory part file?

764
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,850
Or that I don't know where there is a filer part.

765
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,450
Right?

766
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,760
See,

767
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,430
you were given.

768
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,130
If you are,

769
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,370
you are given part.

770
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,120
So this each file or directory.

771
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,500
So what?

772
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,030
You're going to get complete part right so that we can printed.

773
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,410
But I'm storing into one variable.

774
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,010
Then I will print Way is not part.

775
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,800
Don't join You were given father in that location.

776
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,290
One by one file I'm taking on.

777
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,760
I'm marrying that one by one file for your park.

778
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,850
Then I'm going to print.

779
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,810
Okay.

780
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,020
So,

781
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,230
guys,

782
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,570
For what?

783
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,510
Our understanding purpose.

784
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,580
What I'm taking is this where Lou?

785
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,810
I'm taking okay.

786
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,050
And I'm copping their little indie work script.

787
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,310
So injured off this list off files and directories actually are getting that output us in

788
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,160
this way just for her.

789
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,350
Just to give the clarity,

790
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,260
right.

791
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,760
No gym that you're providing part as something called this one you are providing.

792
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,820
All right,

793
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,260
let me take directly that.

794
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,330
I was so in your script again.

795
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,090
I will remove this.

796
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,660
Any finally will run our script.

797
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,730
No.

798
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,480
Forget about your previous Ah,

799
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,930
logic not.

800
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,540
See here.

801
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,740
This is a part on in this part.

802
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,650
We know Jim,

803
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,260
that we know these are the list off values or items.

804
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,690
Know what I'm doing is I'm going to take one by one from this for each file.

805
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,540
A territory What?

806
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,600
Do your part and we'll go.

807
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,530
This foster valuable ascended this variable on the lines which are there under your look.

808
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,540
Those lines will exclude ones while excluding what we are doing?

809
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,040
I'm taking one variable under the dell pathways that partner join.

810
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,550
I'm adding this part.

811
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,170
See that I'm adding this spot.

812
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,650
Then first time your file is my territory then,

813
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,100
my daughter.

814
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,370
Damn adding here so that I'm going to get for these complete part.

815
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,110
Then you're going to print that second time You're going to take this one.

816
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,080
But I can You are adding for your part only your party's you're given.

817
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,650
But so this part.

818
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,720
Then this file is going to get complete part like waste.

819
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,990
You're going to get part for all the files,

820
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,610
right?

821
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,280
So actually,

822
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,340
what is the variable here?

823
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,780
We heartache and let me dynamically hard work it.

824
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,400
That's why.

825
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,850
Don't fix any values here but internally hydrogen that this well is a realist.

826
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,660
Then remove this one.

827
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,780
That is your logic,

828
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,120
right?

829
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,620
If you want to check your script,

830
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,450
just this is your script from here to here.

831
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:43,370
Now I'm running and I'm providing it part no seed output for each and every file under

832
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:50,920
three are getting complete part like but simply introduced printing In this way.

833
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,820
If it is a territory,

834
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,210
I want to print that This is a territory if it is a file I want to burn.

835
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,950
This is the file.

836
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,040
No,

837
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,580
inside off your loop itself.

838
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:06,850
Like I'm going to add if condition If ways dot part dot is file ever file under a tree?

839
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:13,210
If it is a file I can say here for the or P.

840
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,010
Is it fine else?

841
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,140
If there is not correct,

842
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,590
that means that is not the file.

843
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,330
That is not the filings.

844
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,930
Then you can say that there is a directory.

845
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,430
No easy directory.

846
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:26,950
That's it.

847
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,300
Save it unfunny.

848
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,940
But before going to run,

849
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,350
you have to understand once again your entire core,

850
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:38,620
this entire part you're repeating for each and every value,

851
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,470
which is there in a list list.

852
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,950
Is this one?

853
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,150
No,

854
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,480
this is a list you're taking one by one on for that one by one,

855
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
you are finding complete part better That accompanied part.

856
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,050
You're executing this defense block.

857
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,020
If where's that part that is filed for your comfort part?

858
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,900
If it is a file,

859
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,370
this will execute them.

860
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,950
Your first generation is over for foster value.

861
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,160
Then you will take second value for second.

862
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,360
Well,

863
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,120
you're going to get complete part again.

864
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,480
You're checking defense condition.

865
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,640
In case if we seize fighters of false than your printing,

866
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,480
this one then second iteration,

867
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,150
is also over.

868
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,860
Likewise,

869
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,940
you're far rupees doing this action for each and every file.

870
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,050
So they're finally you're going to get dynamically for any number of files and directories

871
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,050
.

872
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,020
You were able to identify the list off filed Sunday.

873
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,460
Please see the output.

874
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,130
He's a territory are getting easier for you.

875
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,180
Not only this path.

876
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,850
Now you can provide any part.

877
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,840
Let me take some other part.

878
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm going to takes about this as my part.

879
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,490
Then probably your pot.

880
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,730
Yes,

881
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,320
this is a very loose That's what I'm providing.

882
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,090
Two slashes,

883
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:46,870
same script.

884
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,910
You can run on your next like systems as well.

885
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,460
It will work without any error in case if you're getting any better.

886
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,490
Anyway,

887
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,100
you won't get it.

888
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,960
If you have any challenges,

889
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,830
just let me know so that I will give the comfort script to work with your innings as well.

890
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,750
But with out there in the little work,

891
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,960
see the results in the given location.

892
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,190
First of all,

893
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,400
you're having this man number off files.

894
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Maybe that restore files you don't know which is a file in which is that a tree by June

895
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,540
That then your python is able to form a complete part.

896
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,040
The part?

897
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,030
What are we are giving from that?

898
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:26,710
Your partner is ableto are this part then is giving is a fight is a fight is a fight is a

899
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,640
fight Liza Felisa,

900
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,720
That's what it is working,

901
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,160
right?

902
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,850
That's it.

903
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,270
So,

904
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,680
guys,

905
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,250
this entire explanation is just to understand your Luke concert.

906
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,950
Okay?

907
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,840
See are taken this example.

908
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,200
But my intention is not total of this script Tokyo It will loop concepts.

909
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,120
So here how Given Worrell idea in later sections I will use the best up again.

910
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,290
You're completely look how to use that.

911
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,280
What is the complete syntax in which scenario you're going to use which you all those

912
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,480
things we will see We are two loops.

913
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,350
One is for Luke.

914
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,750
We have seen that next lobe is way low.

915
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,520
Along with that to control your loop actions,

916
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,160
you have some break and continue keywords break and continue.

917
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,560
So this also I'm going to explain with help off examples only I won't go directly on.

918
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,460
I want to give your syntax and I won't write your core directly by using your loops.

919
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,480
I will take this situation then so that you can easily understand how.

920
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,670
What is the purpose of that?

921
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,460
Why we need it.

922
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,410
Right?

923
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,780
Okay.

924
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,470
Okay.

925
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,970
Thank you for watching this with you.
