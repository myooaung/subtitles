1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,090
friends here.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,180
We're going to discuss aboard comments,

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,280
comments off,

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,750
fight on,

5
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,710
See before dealing aboard commands.

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,910
Let me weapon my terminal.

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,160
Right.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,750
So there's still I'm trying to work using via or via Morita's,

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,590
right from Cameron Line.

10
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,650
I'm using we I am Editors.

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,500
Let me that symbol by Dan Skip first.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,050
Suppose I'm going to write uses off comments,

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,950
Not the way any bite on programmers script.

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,950
So here I'm going to explain how to use comments.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,100
Right.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,950
So guys foster thing comment is nothing back?

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,200
Wr writing some pie Transcript Yes,

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,670
I do mean house,

19
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,550
um thousands off lines night.

20
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm to understand What is the purpose off your python price by done script or python

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,430
program,

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,340
you have to go with each and every line on the order,

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:01,780
understand?

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,610
I mean,

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,750
suppose some third person.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,870
So instead of dirt,

27
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,410
you can write somewhere some comments,

28
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,950
some lines representing that,

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,450
saying that what is the purpose of this school?

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,020
Suppose Let's say first off,

31
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,750
while I'm going to write some simple bite on program some year close to four on because to

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,590
fight and then I'm finding result equals a plus B.

33
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,170
Don't worry,

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,360
guys.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,390
How to write this program.

36
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,940
Okay,

37
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,910
While going forward,

38
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,950
we will learn how to write.

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,180
No,

40
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,350
I'm trying toe print.

41
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,950
Right.

42
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:44,150
The addition off you on the east.

43
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,050
This is the result.

44
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,250
Just I'm bringing this alertness sale this on.

45
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,160
Right it on.

46
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,150
Let me run this.

47
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,450
We'll take it whether you're able to get output or not.

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,960
Yes,

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,110
we're getting somewhat put,

50
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,710
right?

51
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,890
No see,

52
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,530
because this is very simple program.

53
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,990
By seeing that you can understand that,

54
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,250
Yes,

55
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,540
we are defining two variables on your finding the addition of those two where it was on

56
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,190
your printing.

57
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,000
But you should have dirt.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,050
I conveyed some comments somewhere.

59
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,700
So I am writing.

60
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:23,810
This is a simple at the medic calculator.

61
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:40,690
I'm implemented by suppose on one way it is implement their let's suppose some too late to

62
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,380
Jura 19 And what is the worst in off the score?

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,240
Ehlert.

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,390
Sir,

65
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,950
Disease.

66
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,090
We don't wonder deal if you are there.

67
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,380
Guys,

68
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,230
these lines are not your fight on programs,

69
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:54,660
lights,

70
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,000
but these are something like comments to give some information about your fight on Skipper

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,850
Python program.

72
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,260
That's why you fight.

73
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,450
Run this program,

74
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,350
right?

75
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,300
Let me do it.

76
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,850
They're lost Yeah,

77
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,580
No,

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,390
let me say V.

79
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,010
And if I try to run,

80
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,530
it was script.

81
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,450
You will get another.

82
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,700
This is a simple automatic carolers invalid syntax because there is not a valid syntax.

83
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:21,970
Actually,

84
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,150
this is not the point on program line.

85
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,810
So you are writing something to give you information about your script to the third person

86
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:29,810
,

87
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,010
right?

88
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,000
So those lines are cummings on while running your fight on program.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,850
If you want to skip this lines,

90
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,090
this lines,

91
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,400
you have to write each and every line you're to start with the hash symbol so that all

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,750
lines are coming out.

93
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,680
You're fightin while running your bite on.

94
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:48,960
No,

95
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,720
you're fightin won't cancer.

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,020
These lines size your Buyten's program lines.

97
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,110
And simply your pipeline will skip this lines even though it right this this type of lines

98
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,110
,

99
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,620
thousands off lines in your program.

100
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,370
Your python won't because that these lines as a python script lines and then simply it will

101
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,800
skip those lines on your fight on program starts from here a close to four because the fire

102
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,770
result on these four lines will execute right now.

103
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,140
Let me save it and burn it,

104
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,220
Coleman.

105
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,320
Let me say this?

106
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,410
No,

107
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,160
I'm going to run now.

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,340
Instead of getting another,

109
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,150
you will get output.

110
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,050
That's it like fine.

111
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,080
So there is no you have to understand that.

112
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,120
Toe comment A single line.

113
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,730
You can use hash symbol like even if you want to come in some 1000 lines for each and every

114
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,350
line before starting your line,

115
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,580
you hard to write harsh symbol.

116
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,550
Let us assume that you're having support some 100 comment lines under in sequence.

117
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,350
Right?

118
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,850
So to come in the 100 lines water how to do for each and every line.

119
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,150
How to start with the hash symbol.

120
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,150
But I am the lazy person.

121
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,950
But now I'm going toe you some shortcut.

122
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,760
Whatever the lines,

123
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,840
you want to come in all those lines you can write between tribal courts.

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,780
Those triple courts may be single or double.

125
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,650
I can use a this single court three times or double course three times.

126
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,320
Now this is exactly equals two you are placing if you want to come in.

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,430
All these four lines are your commenting by placing Hashim blunder starting off your each

128
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,260
and every life no in giraffe that you can simply place.

129
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,590
He were commenting lines.

130
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,520
Comment lines Between this quotations,

131
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
these are trouble coats A.

132
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,650
The single level courts are double quotation symbol three times.

133
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,820
Right now,

134
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,350
Let me sell this onder under and see the output before going to run.

135
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,650
Let me do one thing I'm going to see you are script.

136
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,800
This is your script,

137
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,910
and I'm going to run that perfectly.

138
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,850
Working means your fighter now keeping these lines on these lines are coming too low.

139
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,360
Okay,

140
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,110
so they comments or two types single and comments and multiple line comments.

141
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,820
So singling comments you can come into with the hash symbol on multiple line comments in

142
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,900
case you feel sometimes,

143
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,350
you know,

144
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,600
or some sequence off lines,

145
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,700
some hundreds or tens or some 50 lines right on maybe two lines.

146
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,040
Also,

147
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,100
you can come in with the tribal courts as well.

148
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,140
So multiple line comments is tribal courts.

149
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,480
So and remember that it may be single condition.

150
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,870
Three times are you have to start with Three double conditions are already underway to

151
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,050
three double conditions.

152
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,550
That's it.

153
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,590
Okay.

154
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,770
Okay.

155
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,680
I hope it's clear.

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,890
Okay,

157
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,170
guys,

158
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,550
thank you for watching this with you.
