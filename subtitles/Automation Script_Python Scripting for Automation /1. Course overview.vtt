ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
my friends.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.330
Welcome toe fight on skipping for automation Course friends fight on is very popular in

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.040
different areas on one of the areas.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.650
Automation.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.990
Let me insure you the different areas in which your fight on its popular.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
So you bite on his popular in application development site.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.860
I mean,

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.400
like Web application development.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.550
AP a dollop man on some geo application development for your desktops,

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.540
right?

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.670
And then they die.

12
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.210
Analysis that Donald DEETs.

13
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.650
Artificial intelligence,

14
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.160
you know?

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.770
Yeah,

16
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.210
he's very,

17
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.150
very popular.

18
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.200
Right on.

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.950
Bite on is extensively using in your eyesight,

20
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.550
then for Web scraping and textile processing,

21
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.450
selenium testing and then automation.

22
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.200
Not only these areas,

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.630
there are many more other areas as well,

24
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.650
but these are the major areas in which your fight on his popular see if bite on his popular

25
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.650
.

26
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.830
Then definitely it has some unique features.

27
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.550
Comfort toe,

28
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.900
other programming languages or stripping languages like so because of that only or fight on

29
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.490
is popular.

30
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.580
Then one of those white bite on is popular right.

31
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.750
Let me go through that.

32
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.250
The very 1st 1 is python is easy to learn because off its simple sin taxes.

33
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.510
See if you compare your fight on with other programming or scripting languages.

34
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.810
It is having very simple sin taxes,

35
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.930
you know,

36
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.650
if l very simple sin taxes,

37
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.820
then you can easily Lunder once.

38
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.470
If you learn it,

39
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950
you can easily a play that for your real time scenarios,

40
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.920
right?

41
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.950
So that is one of the point to become your python as popular language,

42
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.250
then many models pre defined on third party models.

43
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.430
You guys,

44
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.610
in case if you know if you have some basic soft fight on,

45
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.240
then it's OK.

46
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.650
Otherwise,

47
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.420
just assume that model is nothing but pre defined Python programmer pie.

48
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.050
Transcript.

49
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.140
Right?

50
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.480
Just agenda.

51
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.500
Working with the database is a common scenario at your application development side.

52
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.450
No Suppose if you're going to develop some application on in there,

53
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.190
you need to write some court to connect with your database to run some queries with the

54
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.850
ordered abyss.

55
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.180
Right?

56
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.550
There is a common task.

57
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.410
That's why father task You don't need to write a court.

58
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.740
It's even know.

59
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.770
But if it is a common or replicate your task for that type off tasks.

60
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.850
Already someone has returned a python scripts,

61
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.150
and that is called.

62
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.430
Actually,

63
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.250
we are calling that as a model.

64
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.290
No,

65
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.460
you can use that model.

66
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.210
And Barrett Lee,

67
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.250
you can use that in your Application Development Corp.

68
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.090
Right?

69
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.600
So that you need to write your core from scratch to work with database.

70
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.750
Right?

71
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.390
So that means you're saving time sometime and you are going to reduce the number off lines

72
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.150
in your court.

73
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.250
Right?

74
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.970
So because off many models your part on its popular not only working with database there

75
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.610
are so many models for different areas I'm not sure whether you know or not as off no,

76
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.590
with your python,

77
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.200
they are our own one leg.

78
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.150
47,000 models are there.

79
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.960
But don't worry.

80
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.180
You don't need to learn all one like 47,000 models base run in which area you are

81
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.610
interested or in which area you're going to usurp.

82
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.960
Eitan.

83
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.800
Based on that,

84
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.580
we are you know,

85
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.550
some of the models.

86
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.150
That's it.

87
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.250
Right then.

88
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.220
Corland is very short because of third party models.

89
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.320
Just know we discussed that to work with data vase.

90
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.840
If there is no pretty pre defined by transcript,

91
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.780
what we have to do,

92
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.550
we are the right court from scratch.

93
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.830
But luckily,

94
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.650
if you have 1/3 party model for your requirement.

95
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.860
Then you don't write a court,

96
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.100
right?

97
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.250
You can use that badly so that you're going to reduce your colon.

98
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.440
Right?

99
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
Then platform in the Berlin Just a June dirt.

100
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.600
You're going to work as a suppose middleweight.

101
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.950
I mean,

102
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.310
right,

103
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.350
let's say in real where you're going to work as a Tomcat application admin.

104
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.590
Right.

105
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.110
And,

106
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.500
you know,

107
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.810
you can install your time,

108
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.050
get Oregon,

109
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.790
install and run and manage your time Get on Windows operating system as well as some UNIX

110
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.430
like systems.

111
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.650
Right.

112
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.620
You can install your time,

113
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.350
get on both orbiting systems.

114
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.730
I mean,

115
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.730
in different orbiting systems.

116
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.990
You can run you a tomcat.

117
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.900
Now,

118
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.450
assume that.

119
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.350
Yeah.

120
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.360
I want to automate some task on my tom get I don't know,

121
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.800
python.

122
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.050
Right?

123
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.150
So first observed window site.

124
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.600
If you're working at window side to want,

125
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.480
omit your task by the fold.

126
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.310
With your windows,

127
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.150
you have either batter skip on power shell.

128
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.850
You can use anyone off the scrip on.

129
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.150
You can automate your task.

130
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.150
But Sam Skip will not work at your UNIX like systems.

131
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.650
Then if you come to UNIX side again,

132
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.120
you're right.

133
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.850
Some separate shell script to automate your task.

134
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.920
See,

135
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.640
for the same task because off different platforms you're separating separate the scripts to

136
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.750
automate your task.

137
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.790
But if you know,

138
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.450
bite on,

139
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.960
you can write only one pipe landscape,

140
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.620
such that that script will work with your Windows operating system as well as your UNIX

141
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.350
like systems.

142
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.500
So this is the reason,

143
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.560
because off this,

144
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.850
we are calling Fight on East Platform independent.

145
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.980
No,

146
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.770
you don't need to write two different scripts to work with the different operating systems

147
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.770
,

148
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.150
right?

149
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.450
You can use only one script by transcript.

150
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.250
By then,

151
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.300
we'll work actually with the different operating systems.

152
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.010
Whatever their skipper,

153
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.720
you're going to run on one numbering system.

154
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.280
Same skip.

155
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.150
You can write with other offering systems as well,

156
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.250
right?

157
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.490
So because off this also pipeline is very,

158
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.250
very popular.

159
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.920
Fine,

160
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.440
then finally fight on is support.

161
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.050
I don't supports functional as well as oops concepts,

162
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.340
right?

163
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.730
That means not only by done guys,

164
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.440
if you go with any programming,

165
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.430
are skipping language.

166
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.330
If it supports functional as well as groups concert,

167
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.150
then definitely it is a good language.

168
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.350
Fight on is also one of that,

169
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.850
right?

170
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.750
Fine,

171
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.360
no coming to our courts structure I mean,

172
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.270
this entire course,

173
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.450
What we're going to learn on What is the sequence we're going toe learn python.

174
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.940
So you first,

175
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.750
we're going to cover core pipe on,

176
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.140
incorporate on.

177
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.700
I'm going to cover basic soap,

178
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.730
fight on models,

179
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.270
libraries,

180
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.850
packages and functions.

181
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.390
And then I will go on work with your hopes concert and while working with you or Corp Eitan

182
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.110
as well as I do want to fight on,

183
00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:02.890
I'm going to explain this concert right with the real time practice so that you can apply

184
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.350
your concerts in your real them very easily.

185
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.100
Right?

186
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.950
So this is my course structure days.

187
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.450
So finally,

188
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.000
just I want toe you.

189
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.420
The information about you are a python.

190
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.200
Simply What is python fight on is a powerful multipurpose or general purpose programming

191
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.210
language and created by guru wondrous um,

192
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.970
multi purpose our general purpose programming.

193
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.650
That means,

194
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.520
But I thought you can use it in anywhere in your real time.

195
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.240
Simply,

196
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.950
you can use your python anywhere in your real time.

197
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.550
That's a and not only with your fight on,

198
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.710
if you go with any software.

199
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.210
Generally there are different questions,

200
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.220
even in part.

201
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.050
And also we have two types off worsens there.

202
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.370
Neurotics on critics again in cortex.

203
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.020
On third X,

204
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.450
we have some sub questions.

205
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:52.750
What,

206
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.360
you don't bother awards abortions,

207
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.650
right?

208
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.950
It's very simple to understand.

209
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.710
Fine.

210
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:05.610
Come back to neurotics on three or six night in three Codex.

211
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.050
Most of the outputs are like object,

212
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.650
but in critics that it will get your output.

213
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.760
Actually,

214
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.580
enhancer technique is there with your $3 X.

215
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.690
Anyway,

216
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.990
one more thing you got to remember after 2020 there will be no any further.

217
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.330
A noodle of men devoted $3 extra.

218
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:34.150
Two x After 2020 there will be no any further dollar print with the neurotics.

219
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.780
So that's why I definitely after 2020 right?

220
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.530
All of the organization's they're going to move with three R Tex on a gain in Theoretically

221
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:49.860
halted at 456 and seven Now the latest abortion with your creed or exercise to lord seven

222
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.550
dot exe.

223
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.860
Now it's better to learn 3.7 dot it's It may be any wash in two years,

224
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.920
so not one or three yards under two or three or four.

225
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.750
Something like that,

226
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.670
right?

227
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.510
So here,

228
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.270
as if no I'm going to take the stable washing in three headaches.

229
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.060
That is street art.

230
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.750
Sound art zero.

231
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.200
Right.

232
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.380
So this entire course,

233
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.840
I'm going to explain with the trade or 70 But what are this in Texas we're using while

234
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.610
explaining your played out $7.0 same syntax even use with your theory X questions,

235
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.680
right?

236
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.600
And also,

237
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.510
I'm goingto provide at the end of this course.

238
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:32.220
What are the major differences between neurotics and critics so that once if you good with

239
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.150
anyone of the scripting,

240
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.860
it may be too right xrt rid X After that,

241
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.150
if you learn what other differences between heretics and tear it takes,

242
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.380
then once you come to know that,

243
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.650
then you can easily work with a the heretics orthotics.

244
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.290
But my intention is it's better to learn three dot Exe,

245
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.300
because we are very near toe 2020.

246
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.330
So after they're definitely right,

247
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.360
major development major third body models will come with potatoes,

248
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.250
eggs only.

249
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.110
Right?

250
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.050
So that's the reason I'm starting the Rolex Washington fight on training.

251
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.700
Right?

252
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.680
Okay.

253
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.150
Thank you for watching this with you.
