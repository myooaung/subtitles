00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
parents here.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.680
We're going to see how to create a CS refile using python.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.880
Right.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.250
So let me make this simple by transcript just to create a CSP.

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.650
Fine.

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.350
So whenever if you want to create a CSC fight first ofall unity imports es remodel into

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.450
your by landscape Let me try the skip numbers.

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:32.920
Create CSP if I got so I want to create a CS before insanity imports es we first like so

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.900
let me create any CS We file in any location.

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.450
Let me create a file in this location,

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.590
right?

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.120
Yeah.

13
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.760
See that?

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.990
That it weaken take.

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.520
You are required.

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Suppose required file are recorded states before I look awesome.

17
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.350
X rayed your dot c a sweet,

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650
but very want to start this.

19
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.990
That's why it's better to provide complete,

20
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.550
but for your file.

21
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.350
So suppose I want to create my CSP file somewhere in this box.

22
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.190
So this is the part where I want to store my CSP file.

23
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.140
And then what is the name you want to create here?

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.840
I mean,

25
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.250
40 or so years before let's say the more Darcy s weak.

26
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.150
That's a right.

27
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.280
See you guys.

28
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190
If you have a CSP file.

29
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.800
If you want to read the content off your CSB will waterboarding First,

30
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.350
you're opening your file.

31
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.750
Read more.

32
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.580
But here we want to write a content into your CSS file than what we have to do is you need

33
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.090
to weapon this in right more.

34
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.650
That's it,

35
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.970
then finally,

36
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.750
we had to close it.

37
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.540
Between this,

38
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.430
you'd write a content into your CS.

39
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.850
We fight,

40
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.800
right?

41
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.560
Fine.

42
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.450
See?

43
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.560
Yeah,

44
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.280
I really One thing.

45
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.050
First of all,

46
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.250
I'm going toe leave the convent,

47
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.100
then.

48
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.710
Based on that,

49
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.250
I will try to convert that escape.

50
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.950
I think you have a file Cornu in four.

51
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.210
Right.

52
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.040
Let me read the file Country.

53
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.630
So we are going to create an object it called reader object.

54
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.570
So you are seeing a sweet really seem like simply content,

55
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.350
whatever it may be,

56
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.940
So simply see us.

57
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.920
We thought,

58
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.650
reader.

59
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.350
So you are passing your object,

60
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.700
then delimited because toe Come on,

61
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.400
then,

62
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.280
for each roll,

63
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.880
right in your CIA.

64
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.290
Sweet.

65
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.450
Read that.

66
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.750
Then you are able to print each room.

67
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.550
Yes.

68
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.450
I'm goingto get something.

69
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.890
What is that?

70
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.670
What happened?

71
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.390
Required for Yeah.

72
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.840
Sorry.

73
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.740
That is available.

74
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.630
Like I mentioned as it string.

75
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750
That's not good inside available.

76
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.640
You have a file name?

77
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.050
Yeah.

78
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.750
Now it's good right here.

79
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.720
The limiter for this file.

80
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.810
This pipeline like,

81
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.370
let me take biplane as my day limiter.

82
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.650
So if you have the each row is like a one list Like,

83
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.290
See,

84
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.600
now what I'm doing is based on these steps,

85
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.390
so reading issues to file is very easy the same way.

86
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.250
If we convert this into to write the controversy is we fight,

87
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.210
then it's very simple.

88
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.850
Let me take now,

89
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.050
create.

90
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.830
Even.

91
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.450
I'm going to come in this file as well.

92
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:40.110
Not just a comfort those steps and tell me so I want to create a file called the more dot

93
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.020
CS We so previously you open your fight for read.

94
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.900
Now I want to open this file toe right.

95
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.900
The content so required file right more.

96
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.550
That's it.

97
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.710
So previously you created object called CSP leader to read the content from your file

98
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.350
object.

99
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.450
But now I want to create a writer.

100
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.660
Nothing.

101
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.620
Is that instead off reader,

102
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.040
right?

103
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.450
See that I want to create their CIA sweetie.

104
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.110
Right?

105
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.690
You don't need to take this variable.

106
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.110
Exactly.

107
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.090
Can take any variable,

108
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.220
right?

109
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.610
So I'm taking CS three daughters,

110
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.340
right for your file.

111
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.930
Object.

112
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.690
Then let me take deli meat up as of no,

113
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.350
I'm going to take it as a comma.

114
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.350
Qamar Biplane.

115
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.870
Women see for different symbols.

116
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.980
I'm in different millimeters,

117
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.250
right?

118
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.250
Fine.

119
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.490
No Finally unit to close your file.

120
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.900
No,

121
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.100
you need to write some content.

122
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.890
Do you will see a street fight night.

123
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.090
See whenever.

124
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.150
If you're reading the content from your sees before what you're getting,

125
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.980
you're getting a list the same way.

126
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.390
But nobody.

127
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.310
If you want to store the content into your CSE file,

128
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.820
each line must be like a rule.

129
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.920
That room must be like a list.

130
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.150
That list consist off your columns.

131
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.150
Nothing is that Let's say I want those store my head up.

132
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.420
Right?

133
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.070
Let me clear.

134
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.800
Sahara Suppose so.

135
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.060
CSP right that dot Right.

136
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.230
Throw your toe right.

137
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.760
You rule.

138
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.560
So what is our role?

139
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.620
Our room must be a list As of now on that list consists off different values.

140
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.650
Each value is like a one column in the worse es with a tick serial number.

141
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.780
Let me take name on.

142
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:38.600
Let me take is not so as of know what I did I created only Heather Part.

143
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.950
I created only Heather Park.

144
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.150
Let me save it on Run it!

145
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.850
It's done.

146
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.910
Let me go to my dad.

147
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.120
A tree where I'm creating on there is a file called them or let me we open it are enough

148
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.970
for text.

149
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.700
If I deliberately,

150
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.250
I'm going to warm it using your exit.

151
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.650
Let me open it and see the data.

152
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.280
Yes,

153
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.610
You're able to get your data in your CSP file.

154
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.870
Whatever you have that you are able to a weapon with Your Excellency serial number,

155
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.750
name and age.

156
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.370
Not only with that,

157
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.350
you can also weapon this file using some not back.

158
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.640
Yes,

159
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.360
You are getting by default.

160
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.430
But is somebody you're getting,

161
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.040
comma,

162
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.360
You're not mentioning comma to create your sister filed by default.

163
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.550
If you don't mention any day limiter,

164
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.900
then by default he will see us free money.

165
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.500
Retake Delamuraz Comma guys,

166
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.970
this is not your delimit er this is the separator.

167
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.580
Anyone list this.

168
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.370
Come on on this comma,

169
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.450
they're not equal,

170
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.020
right?

171
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.570
See that?

172
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.780
What I'm doing is now in Turn off this one.

173
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.210
Let me close this file.

174
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.880
No,

175
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.830
I'm going to take Dilemma.

176
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.750
Dress pipeline.

177
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.990
No,

178
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.050
save it on money and see the result.

179
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.390
Open your file.

180
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.950
I'm going to open it using first of all with your place.

181
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.890
See,

182
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.050
now you're separately are getting automatically You are delimited or separator between

183
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.870
columns.

184
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.190
You're getting as pipeline symbol that no,

185
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.240
we know that in case it have a pipeline symbol to separate your columns,

186
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.220
then your extensive gone to open directly.

187
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.550
Const separated over columns.

188
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.750
You know you have to separate it by selecting your column than data text to columns.

189
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.610
Right then the limiter,

190
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.390
then injured or for tab or colon or semicolon or comma.

191
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.020
He had to provide Babb Saudi by plants in Well,

192
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.520
I mean,

193
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.170
whatever the delivery are using to create,

194
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.580
that's it.

195
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.850
So that we will separate.

196
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.550
That's fine.

197
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.350
No,

198
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.200
as I know how many of those you already only 100 body or you had it in here right now at

199
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.400
MIT,

200
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.750
a comma as the separate that you can take anything.

201
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.450
No,

202
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.050
I want to write some foster rule as well.

203
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.720
So just to take this object dark right rule.

204
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.530
Then again provide a list which consists off suppose serial number one name.

205
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.030
Let's say some John is let's say 23.

206
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.450
Say we don't burn it.

207
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.430
Go and open your file.

208
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.670
See the output?

209
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.350
You have a small confusion here.

210
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.970
Yes,

211
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.820
your data is there.

212
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.170
Here.

213
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.930
But the thing is,

214
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.850
you are also getting an empty line here,

215
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.750
right?

216
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:37.340
So they if you are working with fight on three then let me show you that.

217
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.020
Let me close this file in your script.

218
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.920
While opening your file,

219
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.950
you have to write new lying equals toe MP.

220
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.550
There isn't fight on to just write the injured off the snow.

221
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.170
Just like w me.

222
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.050
WB more.

223
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.400
That's it.

224
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.850
This is for fight on two in python three.

225
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.970
You heard right in this room?

226
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.520
No.

227
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.430
Let me save it on.

228
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.680
Really?

229
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.950
On What happened?

230
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.770
Sorry.

231
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.880
Yeah,

232
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.390
new line.

233
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.250
That's a single word.

234
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.200
Not underscore right now.

235
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.450
Open your file here.

236
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.960
Now see the result.

237
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.800
Now you don't know any empty lines in your CSB file?

238
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.720
It's working perfectly.

239
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.250
So there is a small difference.

240
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.550
We didn't fight on three and two in by country.

241
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.560
You had to write New Line E cosi.

242
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.190
MTV hasn't bite onto a hard right.

243
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.350
Simply WB right in binary.

244
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.950
Right.

245
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:39.950
That's fine.

246
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.750
In case if you want to ride one more line.

247
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.600
I mean,

248
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.360
one more rule.

249
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.430
I again want a heart.

250
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:54.840
Today you're to take Righter than right through then property list That least consist off

251
00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.700
your number off columns like Let's say so.

252
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.390
That is the date I want to store.

253
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.950
Save it and run it.

254
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.590
Open your file and see the result.

255
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:13.460
No,

256
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.160
in case So,

257
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.460
actually,

258
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.990
this operation I'm in,

259
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.410
right,

260
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:17.780
bro,

261
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.350
is helpful while writing you are really time scripts.

262
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.700
So But,

263
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:23.950
you know,

264
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.390
you're going to work with some multiple servers and to get the content off each and every

265
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.250
server like,

266
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.600
let's say my CSP file should be in this way.

267
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.550
Serial number.

268
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.320
Sorry.

269
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.970
Our name on what is a waste name for that?

270
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.650
On what is up time for that,

271
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.720
right?

272
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.600
Suppose what is the what share of that.

273
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.150
So one serial number 234 server name.

274
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.280
Well,

275
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.820
his name.

276
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.590
What is the question?

277
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.380
What is the time?

278
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.450
What about pretty in surrounding What is the Joe version?

279
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.120
By finding tool right?

280
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.830
One by one.

281
00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.510
Server information docs refined.

282
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.600
We will see this type of skit while going forward.

283
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.590
Like so as off.

284
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.890
No,

285
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.120
in case if you have big data off it through.

286
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.670
If you want to write that rule,

287
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.550
you can write by using.

288
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.820
Right?

289
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.020
Right?

290
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.510
Right.

291
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.310
Pro operation.

292
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.330
Instead of that,

293
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.400
I suppose I want to write.

294
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.850
I get I'm all Ruth.

295
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.130
I want right at a time all rose into my C s.

296
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.750
We in a single shot,

297
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.350
then?

298
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.410
Yeah.

299
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.970
You have a one more operation car,

300
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.850
right,

301
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.390
Rose.

302
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.350
Then provide your rose as a list off list values.

303
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:47.700
If you remember while printing list off your reader Absurd what you're getting You're

304
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:53.190
getting a list which consists off some number off values on each value is again a list off

305
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.780
values right now,

306
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.260
the same way in a reversal,

307
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.750
we are going toe right.

308
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.080
See,

309
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.270
Nothing is they're very simple.

310
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:09.300
Let me take first my data as I'm taking you can also take any variable.

311
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:19.050
Also my data A list which consists off foster value as a list off your header 100 as a list

312
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.730
as a foster value.

313
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:25.150
Second value this information again as a list.

314
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.230
Second values also one row row is nothing.

315
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.590
But at least you need to remember that.

316
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:38.150
Then that's it.

317
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.070
Now let me save it on before that late model it our file.

318
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.530
Even if it is there,

319
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.050
no bottom.

320
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:44.520
You know,

321
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.470
if it is in right more,

322
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.430
your previous content will be deliver and new data will be Rita.

323
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.450
Yeah.

324
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:53.990
No,

325
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.530
I'm going to save it and run it.

326
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.650
What happened?

327
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.000
Oh,

328
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.270
sorry.

329
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.700
CSC,

330
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:03.880
right?

331
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.280
That right,

332
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.710
Rose.

333
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.750
So what is the your data?

334
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:14.860
So I have to provide that I mr that my data A list which consist off values.

335
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.550
Each of olive is like a one row is nothing but a list in your series before and that's it.

336
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.400
So we're done money.

337
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.240
Open your location and see the data.

338
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.510
Yes,

339
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.210
Demo is there.

340
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.630
Open it on.

341
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.450
See the condiments,

342
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.220
right.

343
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.750
See on dramatically are able to get your data here.

344
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.710
Nothing.

345
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.420
So if you want to store at the time you are all rules.

346
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:36.730
Yes,

347
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.750
you can do it using in this way also.

348
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.850
Right,

349
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:47.850
So engine off this if you want to write one by one rule But nobody for getting information

350
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:47.850
.

351
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.150
I would suppose party instead of work.

352
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.520
Then you can also use this operation,

353
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.060
right?

354
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:59.300
So most of the times I will use this operation are you can also use this one also just too

355
00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.660
right there.

356
00:13:59.660 --> 00:13:59.800
What?

357
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.550
They taught their time.

358
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.530
All they were Rose.

359
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.170
Right?

360
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.450
So based on situation will use anyone off that.

361
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.090
Okay,

362
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.900
we'll see that.

363
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.440
Ah,

364
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.600
one real time scenario to use effectively this CSP file.

365
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.350
We're going forward,

366
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.550
Right?

367
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.030
Okay.

368
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.070
These away.

369
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.140
How to write a CS we file using your fight on or how to create a C C five years in your

370
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.550
fight on.

371
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.350
Okay.

372
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.160
Okay.

373
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.450
Thank you for watching this video.
