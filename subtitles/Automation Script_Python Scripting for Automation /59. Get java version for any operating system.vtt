00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
friends here.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.940
We're going to see one more practice with yourself.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.740
Process model.

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.680
That is simply I'm going toe.

5
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.950
Find Java washing off my server using your cell process Money,

6
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.750
right?

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.680
Fine.

8
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.260
See guys before going toe right there by transcript for days,

9
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.650
you know.

10
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.570
So find Java on your hosted.

11
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.920
Maybe windows or Lennox.

12
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.950
The commander's simply java hyphen wash in like,

13
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.950
Fine.

14
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.590
Then we're going to use this command to find the Java through our piper.

15
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.270
And we are going toe Get on.

16
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630
Li Jiao Washington Suppose $11 Girardot,

17
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.810
four night.

18
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.450
Fine.

19
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.450
Same way.

20
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.350
Let me weapon my UNIX like system.

21
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.950
So he had also I'm going to run Java taipan washing comer.

22
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.350
Now you're getting some washing job,

23
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.520
Which,

24
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.000
and wondered.

25
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.900
Sandra Jiro,

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.650
Underscore 211 Right here.

27
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.830
We're getting levonorgestrel.

28
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.450
Not four.

29
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.330
Now I need here.

30
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.710
This one,

31
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.550
not $7 0 underscore to double one on UNIX.

32
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.150
Maybe any watching you How?

33
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.130
But yet if you object,

34
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.190
you have two different fortunes in UNIX.

35
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.820
You how one worsen on my windows.

36
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.180
How different washing.

37
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.520
But whatever it may be,

38
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.250
I need to find out that Washington.

39
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.470
Right?

40
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.340
So we're going to write a single script such that it has to work for any Java on any

41
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.210
operating system like Fine.

42
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.180
First,

43
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.380
I'm going to write a script on your windows.

44
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.070
So that's here.

45
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.670
I'm going to use here to America.

46
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.810
You can use any other,

47
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.250
like the A R V am.

48
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.590
Some blamed expired charm.

49
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.650
Whatever it may be right.

50
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.420
So if you open atrium,

51
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.790
just goto file and select new file.

52
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.090
Right,

53
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.650
Fine.

54
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.850
So before going to that,

55
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.150
I want to great one dirty and my distraught for practice through atrium.

56
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.470
So I'm going to create a directory.

57
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.550
40 were 8 p.m. On this desktop.

58
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.680
Let's say you don't mean brought peace.

59
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.590
Now I'm going to select that folder here,

60
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.750
So let's stop.

61
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.450
You don't need practice?

62
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.560
No.

63
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.020
In this their territory.

64
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.490
Or for that,

65
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.850
I want to create a fights.

66
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.010
Right.

67
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.780
Fine.

68
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.350
Anyway,

69
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.830
I only weapon a file.

70
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.260
Right now,

71
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.850
I'm going to first to give the name for our strip,

72
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.600
find Joe abortion.

73
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.000
So this is very,

74
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.750
very important.

75
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.450
Please be careful.

76
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.290
Okay.

77
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.970
First of all,

78
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.910
to run our commands right?

79
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.010
We know that we can use a the ways door system or so process more duel with help off your

80
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.550
fight on.

81
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.360
But whenever if you need the modifications or something Operations on the output.

82
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.530
See,

83
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.580
I need I'm going to get this under airport.

84
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.100
But I don't want to get this entire output from this command.

85
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.770
I only this one That means on output you need some modification.

86
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.760
That's why you're going to use a process model,

87
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.050
right?

88
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.860
Let me import.

89
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.550
So process right on command is simply Java high fund abortion.

90
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.880
Now I want to run this command three or so process to run that right.

91
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.650
We know we have already standard Sendak's if you want,

92
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.770
uh,

93
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.120
from or previous classes.

94
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.000
I'm going to directly copy and pictured.

95
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.930
But you just take the cool.

96
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.270
I mean,

97
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.290
from a previous classes,

98
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.850
please try.

99
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.950
Could type manually.

100
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.450
So there you will get a practice on this night.

101
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.650
That's it.

102
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.860
No offer these I need to find out.

103
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.020
Return court means why I am finding SP.

104
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.110
Don't wait me just to run your comer.

105
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.590
So as authorities simply jab iPhone washing common,

106
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.880
you don't bother aboard that it wouldn't take much time.

107
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.950
But in case sometimes some commands might take some execution time.

108
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.020
That's why are going toe Wait out to the completion off your command through python On this

109
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.350
weight,

110
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.360
syntax will also do the return status off.

111
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.030
You were previously excluded.

112
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.250
Command Andi.

113
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.210
Right?

114
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.210
And that is touring RC variable.

115
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.090
Let me do one thing I'm going to find after this output and editor so simply sp not

116
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.500
communicate,

117
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.150
right?

118
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.510
No IFRC close to Geo Then we know that the commander was success and we can see only we can

119
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.150
print out.

120
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.800
Tells after is not in Costa Jiro Then there was another right.

121
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.990
Let me save it.

122
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.720
Right,

123
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.380
So that's through a M.

124
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.490
If you want to run your core units to press control shift and then be no See the output

125
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.700
What?

126
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.090
You're getting so here.

127
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.540
What is the open you're going to get that were important?

128
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.740
Here.

129
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.920
See,

130
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.690
that will be maybes.

131
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:04.010
Sorry I didn't Prue are so unit,

132
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.180
right?

133
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.930
Only to it.

134
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.340
It's my mistake we have taken.

135
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.660
Come on,

136
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.590
our string Whenever you for taking my little spring.

137
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.270
Shelly Coastal.

138
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.780
Right.

139
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.350
We know that.

140
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.010
So I forgot to remove.

141
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.360
Come on,

142
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.730
Senator.

143
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.250
No.

144
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.210
Okay,

145
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.490
fine.

146
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.110
Not see the output.

147
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.650
You're not getting an output here.

148
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.820
Finish it in 1.391 seconds and there is no output here.

149
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.320
See that?

150
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.440
Let me bring separately.

151
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.390
First written gold.

152
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.640
Then after that,

153
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.650
I want to print.

154
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.050
Let me bring out.

155
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.550
So what I'm printing.

156
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.250
Then let me print Error.

157
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:55.750
Let me say a word and let me run it and see the output.

158
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.050
A two quotations.

159
00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.450
Here,

160
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.450
See the output.

161
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.660
You're getting your job.

162
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.770
Our information in the error place.

163
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.540
Not in your or put place,

164
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.290
but written grit and gore is Jiro.

165
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.950
That means your commander or success.

166
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.180
But you are.

167
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.670
Shell is throwing.

168
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.920
You were error.

169
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.550
You are output into error place.

170
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.930
So this is not the problem with your python,

171
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.650
right?

172
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.510
See whenever If you run your job wife in Washington,

173
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.680
man,

174
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.540
you're getting output.

175
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.860
Actually,

176
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.360
this is not output.

177
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.430
This is a one output.

178
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.850
If you want to get clarity,

179
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.790
I want to store my out,

180
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.150
put into some outdoor txt file,

181
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.750
see that it is not throwing your output into older txt file.

182
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.050
Still,

183
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.350
it is displaying on your terminal that mean that is another.

184
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.630
You know there are some stuff.

185
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.370
Course right.

186
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.590
One is for Senator or put to use for error.

187
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.650
Now I want to store my out put into ever file.

188
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.910
I mean the eterindo into this air in order.

189
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.020
Txt If it is success,

190
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.350
right,

191
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.860
success core won't store.

192
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.600
I mean the success.

193
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.850
I'll put one story and do this file only the other Corriero put is going to store into this

194
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.850
.

195
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.120
See,

196
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.340
now you're not getting any or put on your common land.

197
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.510
That means whatever the common you're running that come and output is a road put under that

198
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.850
restoring into this if you want to check it,

199
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.850
see there.

200
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.400
So it is not the problem with your fight on.

201
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.150
It is compatible with your job on your operating systems,

202
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.480
right?

203
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.070
Not only here,

204
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.350
guys.

205
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.260
Even if you go with your UNIX like systems.

206
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.630
See that job wife in Washington?

207
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.020
Suppose I'm going to nullify my output?

208
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.790
I don't want this play output I still displaying.

209
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.090
That means that is a ever or put Norte your commanders excluding successfully.

210
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.330
But you're all pretty storing in our place.

211
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.480
He now finally for error.

212
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.600
That's why I'm not getting anything.

213
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.300
The support different ls on If I run cougar than Donald Still,

214
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.210
you're getting output winds.

215
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.870
That is a success.

216
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.790
Output good put it storing in the success place.

217
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.280
I mean,

218
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.450
stand out place.

219
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.120
But if I do one greater than Donald no,

220
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.750
you are not going to display or part.

221
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.120
So for all commands,

222
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.750
it's common.

223
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.050
One is for you are ah,

224
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.780
I would put to his for better on by default.

225
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.850
All commands will give Max Max.

226
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.010
Come.

227
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.540
Commands will do your output in standard output place only.

228
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.390
But Joe is giving its output in other place.

229
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.750
So you have to take care.

230
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.840
We're working with Joe abortions,

231
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.350
right?

232
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:36.950
So that fight on what I'm doing is see that Let me remove all those things.

233
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:42.730
If written code is zero.

234
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.050
What I wanted to check is like,

235
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.400
let me print.

236
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.750
Simply suppose bullying off your own.

237
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.530
See the output,

238
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.760
what you're getting they're getting false meant there is no foot and let me bring bullion

239
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.250
off and as well what is your ever e right?

240
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.240
Save it under you're getting proved.

241
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.870
That means if if your output seasonal aren't,

242
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.160
if some error is there,

243
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.690
then find your output from error for your job.

244
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.130
That's why what I'm doing is I'm writing a simple if condition.

245
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.650
If,

246
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.360
well,

247
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.570
you know,

248
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.110
if your output is it?

249
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.170
Closed Toe falls on on Why?

250
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.940
I'm taking on no club.

251
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.980
Two conditions You can club to conditions with help off a the end or or operative when you

252
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.810
have to take on.

253
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:45.120
If both requirements are required for you If brother conditions reels are you are expecting

254
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.220
as a these right then only had to club them with help off Aren't suppose here?

255
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.950
I'm clubbing.

256
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.060
My requirement is actually output should be no on then that should be some other.

257
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.650
There should be some era then only how to take your output.

258
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:07.340
So I'm clubbing here to conditions with help off under Better if somebody for take our if I

259
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.510
take our and that this is true Our this is true that will exclude No What is our intention

260
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:13.510
?

261
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.140
It should be false.

262
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.400
Yes,

263
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.970
we know that for that we're taking a condition on whenever it If is it true If both to we

264
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.240
are expecting then only you need to run some logic.

265
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.910
That's why are included Harto club Those two conditions with help off under operator,

266
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.460
Right.

267
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:30.970
Fine.

268
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.000
Know what I'm doing is now.

269
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.530
First of all,

270
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:43.120
I'm printing you are better earned before that.

271
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.700
See if bullion off out anyway,

272
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.950
You are not expecting output your memory for running Java washing command.

273
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.200
Right?

274
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.000
So bullion off equals toe group when it can print simply or pretty,

275
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.950
it also right.

276
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.920
The anywhere this is false.

277
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.950
That's why you're not going toe.

278
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.940
Exclude this output I started this.

279
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.350
Is that output?

280
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.710
The only thing You're getting your output from here.

281
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.230
That's it.

282
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.770
No.

283
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.050
Let me run it and see the airport.

284
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.290
Yes,

285
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.760
you are getting but I don't want to get all these lines right.

286
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.450
What I need Let me split lines.

287
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.970
I need only in the first line.

288
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.740
I need dough awash in right.

289
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.200
If you're out there,

290
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.710
they're getting some spirit lines.

291
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.980
So always guys wherever.

292
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.050
If you go on with your on your java Washington,

293
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.670
you're always going to get their output in this way.

294
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.540
Three lines on first are put.

295
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.570
First line consist off.

296
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:39.820
Java,

297
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.850
abortion information.

298
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:47.730
That's what I'm taking judo on in there.

299
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.580
If you have there always in all irreverent,

300
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.120
maybe even know.

301
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.490
Sorry.

302
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.950
Knicks,

303
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.590
right,

304
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.170
You're going toe.

305
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.930
How job?

306
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.630
Our space.

307
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.950
Washington space number.

308
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.350
So what I'm doing is simply I'm spitting.

309
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.680
You are port and then I'm taking second index value.

310
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.420
Let me save it and panic and sit output you're getting.

311
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.350
But I don't want to get that quotations to let me strip them.

312
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:22.950
See that you're getting on 11 or direct for.

313
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.550
Right?

314
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.340
So you guys same court.

315
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.790
Just I'm going to copy it.

316
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.420
I'm not.

317
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.870
I'm going to place it on your next,

318
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.630
like systems.

319
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.690
Get job.

320
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.350
Abortion,

321
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.290
Nazi.

322
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.240
Let me run this with your fight on three.

323
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.920
See,

324
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.450
You're getting exactly or Joe Washam.

325
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.150
So know what I would just give the we return?

326
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.350
That is a platform Independent script,

327
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.330
right.

328
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.350
This will work for your windows as the last UNIX like systems.

329
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.740
Yes,

330
00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:57.950
Here.

331
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:04.850
You need to understand that very important point is See if you return courted Jiro.

332
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.130
Right?

333
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.320
Then definitely.

334
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.460
You are expecting your output.

335
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.410
Generally generally are expecting or put from your this variable out variable.

336
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.250
That's common,

337
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.060
but very their case.

338
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.440
Sometimes during this type of situations,

339
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.800
right,

340
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.780
you're going toe,

341
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.630
get your or put from error.

342
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.990
That's why what I'm checking is even in order to write this for your job,

343
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.550
if it is only for Java monitoring these two lines also right,

344
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.800
but just I'm reading them for your clarity.

345
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.970
If your output these faults on d.

346
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:36.530
C,

347
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.480
why am writing on that's important thing?

348
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.890
If you are put these falls on good enough early coastal.

349
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.250
True,

350
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.020
If you're getting confusion,

351
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.770
you can also write this score in this way.

352
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.770
But clubbing with the logical operators is a good practice.

353
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.950
So you can also write in this tree that is let me write it.

354
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.300
First out,

355
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.710
I'm thinking,

356
00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:03.140
is if your output output is it closed toe false.

357
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.940
Then again,

358
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.160
I'm going to take it bullion off era.

359
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.190
If it is a question,

360
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:16.190
so then only when we are going to get output from ever right then from the odds that legal

361
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.850
aid this line now already we house in tax to get exactly George Washington.

362
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:20.650
That's it.

363
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:26.550
Let me say a word on granite and see the output you're getting.

364
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:32.300
See if this condition is true And if this condition is also true,

365
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.650
then only are excluding this line right trying to combat this too.

366
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.610
If these two are true,

367
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.520
the result off this one on the result off this one if both are true,

368
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.850
then only are excluding this line.

369
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:50.010
So this type of conditions because you are expecting both are true simply you can write in

370
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.670
one line on the gun club with them under operator such that first your point,

371
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.660
then we check this condition.

372
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.370
If it is true,

373
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.540
then it will check this condition.

374
00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.310
If it is true,

375
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.950
because this undock return because this under operator,

376
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:06.680
whenever deputies under better when or if it club conditions with under operators we're

377
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.090
fighting will check first condition.

378
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.250
If it is true,

379
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.150
then only will go on check next condition and if this is also true dessert,

380
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.950
then it will exclude the line.

381
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.380
Suppose by mistake.

382
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.080
Assume that this is also visit.

383
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.010
The result off this one is false.

384
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.450
Then it won't take very many condition.

385
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.450
Your fight on simply will skip this block,

386
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.870
right?

387
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.720
That's why we're covering these two conditions with elbow fund operator.

388
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.250
Somebody for Diego are here.

389
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.150
Suppose fight and we'll check first this one.

390
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.800
If it is false again,

391
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.480
we'll check this one.

392
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.200
If it is true,

393
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.360
it will exclude this models.

394
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.220
But as one motivate your vitality,

395
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.000
check first this one.

396
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.950
If it is true,

397
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.130
without checking this condition.

398
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:46.890
Simply a question.

399
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.700
Let's do this But I know,

400
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.590
but I'm not like that.

401
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.850
It has to check book.

402
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.500
How many conditions you have?

403
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.750
All conditions must have been true Then only this land will execute.

404
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.450
Right?

405
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.010
Okay.

406
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.750
Thank you for watching this video.
