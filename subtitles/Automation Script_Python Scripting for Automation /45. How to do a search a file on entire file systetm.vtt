ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
friends here.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.350
We're going to do a small practice with your ways dot walk function.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.250
And that is how to re a system where search for a given fighting as you know it in her

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.820
handy how?

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.610
One file.

6
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.500
But you want to such that file part in our entire file system where it is located that But

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.190
I need to find out one more thing.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.520
Well,

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.550
developing this cape,

10
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.380
you had a little of this crypt.

11
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.350
Such a weather.

12
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.410
It should be like a platform independent.

13
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.600
That means same school,

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.690
Same skip.

15
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.720
Should be work with your windows and as well as your innings like systems for time being.

16
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.900
First I'm going toe dollop this script on your UNIX like systems and again will develop a

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.980
court on your windows has been first of all,

18
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.850
let me weapon my the next leg systems.

19
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.950
This is my next like system.

20
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.660
So I see if you know the file system about your next like system.

21
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.640
Suppose if I you simply a route this symbol slash Then this is nothing but your entire file

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.350
system on your UNIX like systems.

23
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.520
Now,

24
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.750
if you take this as a part by default,

25
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.450
the meaning for that is you are going to look for entire system in your UNIX like systems.

26
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.970
Let me take one simple example.

27
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.550
I want to know There may.

28
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.150
Hey.

29
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.910
Ah,

30
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.680
something like host not confined,

31
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.150
is there?

32
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.970
So you're getting some permission denied,

33
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.200
because who you are giving entire file system means you should out route religious.

34
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.570
So for time being,

35
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.850
just I'm showing with your UNIX command lines the next comments?

36
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.900
Yes,

37
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.970
if you have a problem.

38
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.670
Permission,

39
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.750
then you are getting exact location where your file is there,

40
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.180
right?

41
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.330
This thing we're going to perform with you are fight on and for time being right here just

42
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.500
to implement this gift.

43
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.270
For time being,

44
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.550
im enter into my route.

45
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.720
Now from here,

46
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.850
I'm going to develop in my python skin just to identify any fight based on your requirement

47
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.850
.

48
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.670
All right,

49
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.750
so what I'm doing is I'm implementing it by transcript,

50
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.550
right?

51
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.950
Such a fight in your entire it system.

52
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.940
Fine.

53
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.780
First of all,

54
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.360
I'm going to read the file name.

55
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.350
What is the file you want to such your entire system in entire five system night?

56
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.500
Let me Day required file equals two.

57
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.330
I want to read a file.

58
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.120
Name only.

59
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.830
File name,

60
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.410
right.

61
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.950
So anti war file Name no such.

62
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.150
Imagine that user is going to enter your fight.

63
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.450
Right?

64
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.250
So they see if you'll remember.

65
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.020
You know,

66
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.350
a promoter Previous radio.

67
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.250
If you have a pot,

68
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.870
then automatically you can able to find out all the file names which are there in your

69
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.650
operating system.

70
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.730
Right?

71
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.150
See that?

72
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.600
First of all,

73
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.050
what I will do is I would take for simplicity purpose.

74
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.850
I will do one thing.

75
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.750
So this But I will take for simplicity purpose first.

76
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.550
Then I would take root file system.

77
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.020
See,

78
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.150
using your ways dot work night.

79
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.230
That's why I'm importing our ways for each No,

80
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.450
no,

81
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.370
right in or ways that work you're going to get three things ruled territory Barrick.

82
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.020
This list files list in our ways dot Walk.

83
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.700
Whatever the part you're going to provide for time being badly,

84
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.540
I'm giving you this.

85
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.750
But then I'm going to print They were rude territory than files.

86
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.700
So because of this,

87
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.260
you're going to get your root directory and the files which are there in that location.

88
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.650
But I want to print.

89
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.350
I want to bring each and every file with complete part.

90
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.230
Right?

91
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.650
See that what I'm doing but each of file in your F.

92
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.230
Yes.

93
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.690
If you're not able to understand this stuff,

94
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.710
please go with your previous previous radio and watch that widow once again.

95
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.550
Then come back that I'm printing simply boys dot part lord join.

96
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.420
You were rude.

97
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.030
Then you're each file.

98
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:30.250
Suppose if I sell this and if I run this cedar script how it is going to work and very work

99
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.250
,

100
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.410
find them to such anyway.

101
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.280
For that we not implement an illogical Let me take simpler tests.

102
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.850
Not be white.

103
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.250
See,

104
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.920
from your home,

105
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.910
You see two user automatically as off.

106
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.180
No,

107
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.290
you're fightin is able to create all files.

108
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.250
All files with comfort parts.

109
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.410
Some very ho.

110
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.930
You're test,

111
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.490
not people.

112
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.440
Right?

113
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.350
Let me show you that.

114
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.790
Mm.

115
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.740
Right?

116
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.150
Yeah.

117
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.850
See,

118
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.770
you're getting somewhere.

119
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.910
I want to print only this fight because I'm giving my searchable filings test.

120
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.120
Not the way So what I will do is very simple days.

121
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.620
We I before printing.

122
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.230
If file is see that what I'm doing Eve each file.

123
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.680
If it is exactly cause,

124
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.150
too,

125
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.870
you are required filed then only I am bringing that but complete part time branding.

126
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.250
That's it.

127
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:34.220
There's not be white.

128
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.170
Yes.

129
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.150
You're getting complete part where it is located.

130
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.530
Not only that,

131
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.520
let me take some other files which are arming.

132
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:50.420
Let me first on display the files which are having in my dislocation late Monday Hideout

133
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.070
Txt And let me run out by Tom Skip on.

134
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.650
Let me provide the such Are you required filed to such?

135
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.430
You're getting complete part now as off?

136
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.740
No,

137
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.550
in your script Whatever you how ways that watch that is taking part as some user home.

138
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.180
But I want to such an entire system entire file system off your next like systems Then I

139
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.550
can take simply slash That's it.

140
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.080
No,

141
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.730
let me money on.

142
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.650
Let me run.

143
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.140
I'm probably file,

144
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.700
um called Test that people You can take anything So this many places your test Don't be

145
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.950
white.

146
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.200
No,

147
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.190
let me run on.

148
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.120
Let me provide host not con Let me run on.

149
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.420
Let me provide something called What?

150
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:45.460
I can see people this many places you hope Let me provide three Not only that,

151
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.450
anything you can get right now we implemented a simple pie transcript Do such you are filed

152
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.250
in your entire file system.

153
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.110
So this is for you.

154
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.290
What?

155
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.590
UNIX,

156
00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.350
like systems.

157
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.540
Let's come back with your windows.

158
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.350
Now here I'm going to implement for you were Windows.

159
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.890
Then finally,

160
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.520
I will club those two courts.

161
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.150
Okay,

162
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.650
let me open my sublime text first.

163
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.700
Guys,

164
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.950
if you Abdur in your Windows operating system,

165
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.350
you hold drives based on drives your different partitions.

166
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.400
So that means there is no single symbol toe.

167
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.850
Identify your entire file systems on your Windows operating system.

168
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.940
See if you go with ur UNIX.

169
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.980
Like systems you hold.

170
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.750
This is slashing.

171
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.130
But also,

172
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.550
that slash means your entire file system.

173
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.050
So this type off similar is not there with your windows orbiting systems.

174
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.280
Right then based on dry,

175
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:56.370
we need to such based on Dr we need to search our file in your Windows operating system.

176
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.050
But I don't know how many drives are there.

177
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.680
Right?

178
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.050
See,

179
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.250
First,

180
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.030
let me implement the court for one day.

181
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.990
Okay?

182
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.330
Let me important ways.

183
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:15.390
Let me stay with first such a file,

184
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.450
not be white,

185
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.750
right?

186
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.760
Okay.

187
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.250
Let me take required.

188
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.420
Finally closed toe something input.

189
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:30.250
Enter your file name to such That's it,

190
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.080
then spot to gaze.

191
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.250
What I'm saying is,

192
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.480
let me do it first route,

193
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.000
that is least fights.

194
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.550
List in your ways dot Walk here.

195
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.070
I can't do any symbol like route in the next,

196
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.260
like systems route means it is going to walk with your entire file system,

197
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.750
But whereas in windows based on drives,

198
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.650
we need to such our file systems.

199
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.450
So if you have a serial,

200
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.180
then you hard to provide zero name one,

201
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.100
then you notice such a right.

202
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:05.720
Let's say let's say I'm going to such from Sidra Know what I'm doing is let me take again

203
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.470
for each file in files,

204
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.600
right?

205
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.960
If you are each file if it is equals to require file,

206
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:22.650
then I can print the complete part for that right ways dot part the door join.

207
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:28.850
Then it would the route in their H file.

208
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.050
Let me go to my common line and let me run this script.

209
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.750
Let me weapon my come and like,

210
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.950
No wonder they stop.

211
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.240
He helped by transcript Definitely no.

212
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.180
Here he how Let me rate by tone such.

213
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.710
Yeah,

214
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.550
this is the script.

215
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.960
No,

216
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.350
I'm going to probably a file name called randomly.

217
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.150
I'm going to give it.

218
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.140
You can provide anything for time being.

219
00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:00.560
What I'm giving is let me take simply even underscore what did not.

220
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.970
People even underscoring,

221
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:09.080
got So it's going to such because you have a number of five systems in your window seat.

222
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.750
That's what is going to take some time.

223
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.690
But anyway,

224
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.250
finally,

225
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.180
you're going to such only in Syria,

226
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.260
see,

227
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.600
on my system I know supposed to drive is there.

228
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.730
But in your opening systems,

229
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.560
you may not have sued.

230
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.150
You may have some driving name as some other name like the e r a F night.

231
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.670
So grace,

232
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.150
because it's taken some time.

233
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.600
What I will do is I will probably apart,

234
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.450
like at least they stop,

235
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.650
but so that it will be easy for a while.

236
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.150
Skip went very quickly.

237
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.120
Let me,

238
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.420
boy.

239
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.680
But as they stop,

240
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.650
but at least actually stop.

241
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.610
You know whenever If you're providing about manually on your nose orbiting systems,

242
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.950
you are too probably to slashes.

243
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.250
That's what I'm property.

244
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.450
No,

245
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.650
let me read on your script.

246
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.630
Unproved.

247
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:04.010
The name see you're getting That's fine days.

248
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.690
But what is the problem with your Windows operating systems?

249
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.170
Is manual your providing?

250
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.050
Cidre parts.

251
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.640
If you go with any UNIX like systems complete find system is slash.

252
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.050
No,

253
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.530
I want to.

254
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.550
Such an anti file system in your windows.

255
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.670
There is no any single symbol to identify that.

256
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.250
Then how you can identify all the word drives on your operating system,

257
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.250
right?

258
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.090
Nothing.

259
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.620
Is there guys before running before searching any file on your Windows operating system

260
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.560
logically,

261
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.120
if you want to.

262
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.150
I didn't identify all that.

263
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.790
I was in your Windows operating systems.

264
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.150
You need to write some extra logic.

265
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.300
But now what?

266
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.550
If you're working with your windows,

267
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.680
let me take possible rice.

268
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.160
Generally,

269
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.920
if you go with the possible rivals there from suppose some you does it small letters and

270
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.680
get little side.

271
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.450
Yes,

272
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.590
let me take it in this way.

273
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.850
Right.

274
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.970
But I don't want right.

275
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.660
I'm the lazy person I don't want right.

276
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.840
Gaby Syria poser.

277
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.440
It's Moreland capitals than what I'm doing is I'm entering into my pipe on Technol Just up

278
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:06.550
there.

279
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.910
Here there is a default model called String,

280
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.050
and if you have there the operations with your string,

281
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.660
there is something called a skill.

282
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.090
A tous like nothing is that simply prayed.

283
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.850
You were string That is the model dot asking underscore.

284
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:31.950
Let us study See the result.

285
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.250
Small letters and capital is directly or getting.

286
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.050
I don't want to take this one.

287
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.470
So nothing is there.

288
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.530
Just import a string module.

289
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.550
You have so many things here just after them.

290
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.850
Now what I'm doing is I'm also importing string module,

291
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.520
then possible drives names.

292
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.430
I'm taking possible rice names.

293
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.020
Equals to simply I can write in this way.

294
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.200
No,

295
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.350
let me print first.

296
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.000
That's just after that.

297
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.660
Finally can understand What is the use is off this thing Now what I will lose.

298
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.750
I will take one by one letter from your possible rows names.

299
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.170
I mean,

300
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:20.850
I'm taking one by one possible Dr name They see ah one thing.

301
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:30.130
Let me take each of each of royal name anywhere possible Drives names.

302
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.940
That is a string.

303
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.250
So if it is a string,

304
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.690
I can take one by one character separately with the help off Your for Luke?

305
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.800
Yes,

306
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.450
You're getting one day one day.

307
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.690
But no,

308
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.280
what I am doing is see,

309
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.730
I don't have all these drives on my operating system,

310
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.170
right?

311
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.870
How only some of them.

312
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.760
But I ain't identified we should drive you How You know what operating system are from your

313
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.150
dessert,

314
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.120
Right.

315
00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:06.000
So that's why what I'm writing is I'm taking See if if lawyers dot pot dot exists,

316
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.400
you're each drive before that.

317
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.760
I want to Yeah,

318
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.500
let me print.

319
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.930
Because if it is a seed,

320
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:12.110
right?

321
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.360
Right.

322
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.320
If he said if it is a seadrill how your part would be c colon slash.

323
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.680
Right,

324
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.240
So no,

325
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.000
any perform that first of all,

326
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.700
if it is a part than how it would be Where is your Kolya?

327
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.710
Each ADR?

328
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.980
Oh,

329
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.450
bless Colon.

330
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.070
Some animal you are writing,

331
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.750
it's better to write to slashes.

332
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.500
No.

333
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.170
See the output you're getting in this way.

334
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:37.950
Your part.

335
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.910
But about that,

336
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.330
this is a valued right on.

337
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.830
Your hosts are not your ticket.

338
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.150
This is like a path,

339
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.880
right?

340
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.350
So what I'm doing is Justin Blame a plaintiff condition if way is not part,

341
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.450
not exist.

342
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.150
If this is a valid apart on your horse,

343
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.050
this condition will become Prue then only I want to print the bridal name.

344
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:03.680
Then only I want to print a drive name now.

345
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.080
See?

346
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.390
As off No Euro police.

347
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.980
All the letters you're getting I mean,

348
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.550
all the drives names you're getting.

349
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.630
But I'm checking the condition if that drive is there and my whole so then only printed

350
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:12.850
that.

351
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.860
No.

352
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.170
See that you're having only see a friend CEO.

353
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.180
That means Captain on small drives,

354
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.880
names or same.

355
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.120
There is no problem with that.

356
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.970
That's why Now if you have during output I mean in the string model you how only a

357
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.790
drastically lower are Ask your party,

358
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.450
convict only anyone off this monitor Take ask you let us know.

359
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.890
So I'm going to take asking lower case.

360
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:40.770
If you want to take,

361
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.020
you can take uppercase.

362
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.250
You have upper case as well if you have very here.

363
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.850
Like anyone off that party is fine.

364
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:58.150
They now see the output CEO now you five open might drive my windows.

365
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.960
See?

366
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.220
Valid does our c,

367
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.690
e and F This is empty.

368
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.090
That that's what it is not their as off.

369
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.220
No,

370
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.630
that's why it is not able to find out.

371
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.050
Deidre.

372
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:14.120
See you Not through logically I can able to find all my valued grows on my windows

373
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.810
operating system.

374
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.200
Now,

375
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.260
if you run this part annually operating system I mean on your windows If you run despite

376
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:20.740
transcript,

377
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.940
you will get based on your Windows offering system.

378
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.850
What are all you were drives that drives names it will display like No,

379
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.480
I am taking a valued Briles names.

380
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.450
Weapon X simply really names valid driver's names as an MP list.

381
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.400
If it is a valued one,

382
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.350
then what I'm doing is I'm collecting that into one variable.

383
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.020
I mean,

384
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.010
as a list a plane.

385
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.890
You were each trail.

386
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.460
I'm going to create a complete part for each and every drill.

387
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.890
Right after completion.

388
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:54.840
Off your for Luke.

389
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.350
Finally.

390
00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:00.520
Just I'm printing three value drought names.

391
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.720
Let me take simply in names injured often name.

392
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.610
That's better.

393
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.070
No,

394
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:05.220
see,

395
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.950
the output finally are getting a list.

396
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.410
Woman names.

397
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.160
Yeah,

398
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.850
no seed output.

399
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:14.560
These are all valued droughts.

400
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.830
Names on my operating system.

401
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:16.200
No,

402
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.470
actually,

403
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:22.350
my intention is I want to such about my file in entire file system on windows,

404
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.520
right.

405
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.230
That's why first of all,

406
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.930
I need to interfere.

407
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.280
All of the value drives on your windows operating system now.

408
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.940
I got them now.

409
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.570
I don't want to print separately or each and every day I collected all your water does as a

410
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.080
list.

411
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.590
Yes,

412
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.760
I hope in my hand.

413
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.760
No,

414
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.550
What I will do is let's be clear,

415
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.280
your immigrant confuse.

416
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.290
What I'm doing is anyway,

417
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.830
I need to read required file,

418
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.050
Right?

419
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:46.950
Okay.

420
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.020
Let me do it somewhere.

421
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.080
I want to read.

422
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.830
Require file.

423
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.080
Yes,

424
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.550
I will read now instead of this logic.

425
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.350
First of all,

426
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.080
I need to search in each and every day.

427
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.500
All right,

428
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.140
First of all,

429
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.170
I'm collecting each of Dr each driving.

430
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.550
You are valued royal names on.

431
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:04.810
Then.

432
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.950
Suppose I'm printing your each drive.

433
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.550
See the output?

434
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.240
Okay.

435
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:10.850
Ah,

436
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.110
let me come in.

437
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.490
Does off.

438
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:12.710
No.

439
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.760
This providing required part.

440
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.150
Yes,

441
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.760
night.

442
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.840
Now let me come in this lane as well.

443
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.330
So using your for you.

444
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:22.950
First of all,

445
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.900
you're able to get your drives one by one.

446
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.050
Rather drives names.

447
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.640
No,

448
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.050
he needed really hard to such so that you can complete,

449
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.700
but all drives on your entire file system.

450
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.170
You're going to such I mean,

451
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.510
now you have to apply your ways that work for each and every drive,

452
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.320
I think is that.

453
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.850
See there.

454
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.700
Four route that leads list file list anywhere.

455
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.550
Where is not worked with each day.

456
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.190
So now faster for loopy.

457
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.850
Just just to collect your one by one value drop names than this loopy is just too.

458
00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.040
Excuse your ways that walk on each and every day.

459
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.380
That's it.

460
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:02.820
No,

461
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.450
Let me do it.

462
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.720
Bring Yeah,

463
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.610
You have a list of fights,

464
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:06.840
right?

465
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:14.180
So for each file in your Richard rail and I cream to simply where's dot part not join.

466
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:14.910
You were rude.

467
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.630
Come on file.

468
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.140
Right now you fight.

469
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.720
Run these just up the road Because off this,

470
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.190
you're going to get all your valued browse names under,

471
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.830
then in each and every day.

472
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.610
I Barrett,

473
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.950
we are going toe print your all fights.

474
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.360
If I run these seed output,

475
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.160
it's keep on displaying woman not least What happened?

476
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.980
Ah,

477
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.350
argument must be string or by not a list.

478
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.440
Is that part of the genius is not a each file.

479
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.350
Your do our it right?

480
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.730
Yeah,

481
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.260
it's fine.

482
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.110
See,

483
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:58.520
your operating system is able to display all they were file systems from your entire

484
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.200
operating system.

485
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.490
Now it is working on Seadrill.

486
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.770
I will wait sometimes so that you can see it will enter into some year.

487
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.850
Now it is still it is working with really only.

488
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.080
Yeah.

489
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.760
You ought to wait some time so that your operating system is going to get from each and

490
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.790
every corner,

491
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.550
all the violence.

492
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.660
You confront the same court on your Windows operating system.

493
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.160
I mean your windows opening system,

494
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.350
then So that your python script is going to do all the file names with your complete part.

495
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.710
Still,

496
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.850
it is working with Seadrill.

497
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.660
Yes.

498
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:46.440
Just wait each day.

499
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.150
Dr.

500
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.900
Names?

501
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.360
Yes,

502
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:48.690
Fine.

503
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.940
Let me go and enable this violent drives names I like.

504
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.010
I will run from here.

505
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.510
Dance will.

506
00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:04.160
It will be clear bite on such fight.

507
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.660
Yeah,

508
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.290
Just give me some time.

509
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.450
Let's just updated output.

510
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:13.000
It is going to form automatically.

511
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.550
All parts for each and every file.

512
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.380
Only for file were writing a logic.

513
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:19.830
Actually,

514
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.990
our intention is just to such a file the same way you can such for some fuller.

515
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.380
Also,

516
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.720
I'm informed our territory,

517
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.300
right.

518
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.550
Just wait and observe the output.

519
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.730
It's working now with the serial for some time to lend under data.

520
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.110
I mean,

521
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.140
you drive under then year because I don't know Deidre.

522
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.950
Okay.

523
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.070
Yes.

524
00:21:40.070 --> 00:22:02.780
Updated output failure by Don is working with You are said Dr only you know,

525
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.160
in windows under your offering system already how lot off?

526
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.420
I mean the violin.

527
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.900
Which you how your operating system in that.

528
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.760
A whole lot of files so as to display all the fights.

529
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.000
Yes,

530
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.760
it is displaying,

531
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.660
right.

532
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.870
Just write some time finally to enter into other drives as well.

533
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.310
So one cities under another drive.

534
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:28.470
Then I will stop when I will write to the remaining logic still with,

535
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.690
see,

536
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:38.340
only you're not my number of files.

537
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.450
That's why it's taking time.

538
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:47.730
Okay?

539
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:55.410
Still with pseudo Because actually,

540
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.890
I insulted so minutes after it's on my Swiss on anyway.

541
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.690
But ive already with your opening system,

542
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.090
our tree house,

543
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.630
so many files in your windows.

544
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.760
So it is going to display all off them.

545
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:14.340
So same logic you can also use to print.

546
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.550
Only suppose some fight on files or some text file something like that.

547
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.350
Okay,

548
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.480
Okay.

549
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.450
At least we had toe rate upfield.

550
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.760
The next level directory.

551
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:53.020
Okay,

552
00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.240
so do one thing.

553
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.500
I just run your escape in your,

554
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.450
uh I'm in annual operating system.

555
00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.670
If you get any challenges,

556
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.440
just let me know.

557
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.660
I will do it,

558
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.870
so I don't want to waste your time by up during this whole put.

559
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:10.680
Let me stop this court right now.

560
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.190
What I want to do is I don't want to print each and every file,

561
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.550
right?

562
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.480
If the file which is your required file,

563
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:17.940
right,

564
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.230
if you will each file.

565
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.770
If it is,

566
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:26.350
it was to your required file then only I want to print that.

567
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.140
Let's see now.

568
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.850
This is what you are in those opening system,

569
00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.560
right?

570
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.270
Fine.

571
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.990
I will do one thing from your C drive itself.

572
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.420
I will take some file name then.

573
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:37.910
That's good,

574
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.160
right?

575
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.450
What I will do is any final aim,

576
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:45.640
right?

577
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.700
You can take any filing.

578
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:46.970
No,

579
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.460
I'm going to run before going to run.

580
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.050
Let me enable which file you want to such?

581
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.400
No,

582
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.710
I'm running your pie Transcript.

583
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.510
It is asking under your required file.

584
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.180
I'm wondering.

585
00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.340
Right?

586
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.720
So it is going to look anywhere,

587
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.400
etc.

588
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.290
And the F trials.

589
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.260
So it's touching.

590
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.950
Definitely will get off sometime.

591
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:05.770
You required files?

592
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.190
Yes.

593
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.150
The files which are ending with your file names.

594
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.850
You're getting them.

595
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.690
You have same file name in a different locations.

596
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.050
They're going to get all off them.

597
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.350
That's it.

598
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:21.200
So there's this is the way how you can such ever file in our entire file system on your

599
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.030
system where if you observe dry you saw there only with your Windows operating system.

600
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.670
You don't have this type off drives on your UNIX like systems.

601
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.810
Now use your script.

602
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.550
Should be platform independent.

603
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.760
How you can make it Your system your script as a platform independent.

604
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.850
See,

605
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:43.290
if you observe this is the court in the world UNIX like systems,

606
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.850
right Where A simple core.

607
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:51.020
But you're even though suffering this time you have this court so this court won't work on

608
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.870
your UNIX like systems on That's just core.

609
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:54.580
Whatever the quarry,

610
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.790
how are never in excess UNIX like systems that won't work on your windows then nothing is

611
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.620
that It's very simple.

612
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.450
If you remember,

613
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:05.880
we have a black for model,

614
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.160
right?

615
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.610
Let me show you it.

616
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.710
And on your common line,

617
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.950
if we import platform on if you print simply platform,

618
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.160
not system.

619
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.660
What is the output?

620
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.490
You're opening system name?

621
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:20.720
No.

622
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.440
Based on this,

623
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.400
what I'm doing is right.

624
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.550
So these parties for the world with those right,

625
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:31.660
if if you are platform dot system,

626
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.510
if it is equals to windows,

627
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:41.350
then bung descript run this logic.

628
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.300
So under if condition you had to write this thing.

629
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.050
That's why I'm providing some inundations,

630
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.450
right?

631
00:26:51.450 --> 00:27:01.000
Let me modify or impaired because for each and every line your toe problem now inundation

632
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.860
so that your cold would be there inside off your if condition then this is just what

633
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.830
identify were all value drives then second thing,

634
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:18.110
you're taking one by one drive and then from we are one by one drive with the help of your

635
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.040
wizard walk,

636
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.850
you are creating all your files.

637
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.380
They're not forgetting your one by one file.

638
00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:29.610
Then you are checking whether that given file is matching with anyone off your phone file

639
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.080
with the help of ways that work.

640
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.450
If it is exactly match,

641
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.040
then you are printing that.

642
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.700
That's it else.

643
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.520
If it is not Windows,

644
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.550
then then why do you want to go?

645
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:48.660
Just around you are UNIX like system logic.

646
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:55.460
This one anywhere reading required such filings common very simple Cold.

647
00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.170
They were UNIX.

648
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:02.630
Let me take one by one.

649
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:14.660
That's it once I can.

650
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:22.090
So under this,

651
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.240
if for loop you have a condition.

652
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.930
So under that,

653
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:31.240
I wonder if that's what I'm providing some space right again under this year.

654
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.870
Open straight,

655
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:32.170
man.

656
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.050
Then you should have some space.

657
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:42.180
That's it.

658
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.440
No.

659
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.240
What are the core you're having here?

660
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.940
This will work on your windows.

661
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.860
The same court will work on a what?

662
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.220
In it like systems as well.

663
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.230
Let me show you first.

664
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.500
Annual UNIX like systems.

665
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.480
No,

666
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.740
I greeted a bite landscape on.

667
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.620
It is like a flat form independent skip.

668
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.550
So such a required file in your entire operating system.

669
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.160
Let me copy,

670
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.800
right?

671
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.390
That would run it.

672
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:13.830
Let me a provide.

673
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.900
Ah,

674
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.400
host,

675
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.450
not con file.

676
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.430
Yes,

677
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.890
you're getting Let me run it.

678
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.770
Employed some thus Hoech,

679
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.550
a sinister knee Underscore conflict file.

680
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.750
Yes,

681
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.050
you are talking right?

682
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.400
Same core.

683
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.620
Now it is also going to work with your windows as well.

684
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.200
Now your script is finally platform.

685
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.450
Independent script,

686
00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.900
right?

687
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.630
So let me provide some file name,

688
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.160
which is their very first.

689
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.670
Okay,

690
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.160
Something that is a text file.

691
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.660
Let me copy this name,

692
00:29:49.660 --> 00:30:02.750
not txt right now you're who knows?

693
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:09.440
He's going to such on your we know suffering system for your fine It is that I mean inside

694
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.930
off some I little battery,

695
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.950
so it will take some.

696
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.660
I am to such for that to just wait.

697
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.760
So finally will find all that.

698
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.940
Otherwise I will go One thing.

699
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.070
Very first build on All four bridges going toe are reconciliate,

700
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.300
right?

701
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.640
Yeah.

702
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.810
You have to take some time.

703
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.550
Hey,

704
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:30.090
what happened?

705
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.170
It Stop here.

706
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:44.780
Let me take exactly the file name I will take simply by the under Dxy maybe by tone dot e x

707
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:44.950
u.

708
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.360
Yes.

709
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:53.050
It's finding maybe I have given some dot extension maybe not exactly dot txt for that.

710
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.650
So after getting your files from Seadrill,

711
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.280
it is also looking for your other drives.

712
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.130
That's why it is waiting.

713
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.020
It will take some time because it knows right.

714
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.850
It will take some time.

715
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:09.470
But finally we implemented a script simply who identify to such a file in your entire file

716
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:11.080
system off your operating system.

717
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.650
I mean,

718
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.950
on your system on that Skippy is no platform independent.

719
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:23.840
Nothing is there with help off your If one else condition we how I didn't escape this part

720
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.450
will exclude on your windows.

721
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.950
And if it is not the Windows discovery leg score,

722
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:28.350
that's it.

723
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.770
Like so that this type of logics are very,

724
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.360
very important in your real time.

725
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.330
And you can say this is best example from your Western work.

726
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.760
For you are real time situations.

727
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.160
Okay,

728
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.520
Okay.

729
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:42.880
Yes.

730
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.240
Thank you for watching this radio.

731
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.980
If you have any challenges with this script,

732
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.080
just let me know so that I will explain it to some other examples as well.

733
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.190
Anyway,

734
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.930
we're going forward.

735
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.650
Will get a lot of examples with your ways,

736
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.160
