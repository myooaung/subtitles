1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
friends here.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,980
We're discussing a boat encapsulation off.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,550
Oops,

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,410
she let me already a simple by transport first.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,110
Then we'll discuss about in population.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,680
So let me open my sublime texture that So here I am,

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,570
defending a class called person.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,210
So only are given script Name called some encapsulation.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,900
Don't be way.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,840
Let me read the first method.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,540
Call a sign name on ish,

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,150
self name.

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:42,540
Then let me write a variable cord self dot name because two named and cellphone are 80

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,520
calls to age.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,750
Then let me write Return with the none.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,900
They let me defend one more method to display word information about your object.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,620
Like your name on a Jawf.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,500
Your object name.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,750
Come up self or not.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,250
Goof,

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,050
then return None.

22
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,510
That's fine.

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,420
No,

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,370
let me create a person.

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,880
Object.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,270
I mean,

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,650
any object from your person class.

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:22,950
Let's supports on one equals to simply person object and let me a sign name on the age.

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,690
So if you want us a name on a judge in her to call,

30
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:37,250
you are assigned name on age Metter by bossing Let's say some name on is That's it.

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,010
No,

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,850
let me run this.

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,520
It's fine No,

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,440
I want to display the details off your person.

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,040
One object,

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,190
then I can call display matter off your object.

37
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,710
I can get your information instead of that promoted off your class.

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,480
If you remember,

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,950
we can also get your person one door name,

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,400
right,

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,990
or you can also get your purse.

42
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:15,720
And one dot is so let me bring so I can use display matter to displace your name and age

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,920
off your object or directly from the trade off.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
A class I can call person,

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,550
wondered name or person?

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,440
Wondered ish.

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,160
But here's what I'm doing is internal affairs.

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm taking two under schools.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,340
Underscore Underscored ish.

50
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,710
Then first,

51
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,760
let me call you were display mentored for your object.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,150
For that,

53
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,960
we'll see whether you are able to get your information or not.

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,380
Yes,

55
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,230
we can able to get self your name on self dot Underscore.

56
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,570
Underscore is arguments.

57
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,010
Ah were able.

58
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,350
It's funny.

59
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,850
What opposite?

60
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,650
That's fine.

61
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,350
And let me try to destroy the name from the trade off your class.

62
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,120
Person.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,790
One dark name.

64
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,020
Yes,

65
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,650
it's working.

66
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,050
That's fine.

67
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,830
No,

68
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,250
I'm trying to display person one daughter.

69
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,200
I mean your objective dot is you're getting another called Know it reboot called

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,550
underscoring the school age.

71
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,780
Actually,

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,940
we have that variable here,

73
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,550
right that I tremble we're having here.

74
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,350
But why?

75
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,950
We are not able to access from motor off your class.

76
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,550
So this is because when nobody if we define any variable with two underscores not only

77
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:21,990
variable,

78
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,650
even method,

79
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,620
then that matter or dark variable.

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,850
You cannot access from motel off a class,

81
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,980
but he can access from inside off a class from anyone off your method,

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,850
right?

83
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,060
That's it.

84
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:44,250
That is the way how you can hide variable from your class on this is called encapsulation.

85
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,390
So if you use encapsulation concert for your variables are matter so that he can restrict

86
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,070
the access off your variable or matter from or traffic class.

87
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,450
Let's say I'm using I'm just going underscore display for matter.

88
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,850
I used underscore underscore display.

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,000
Say we thought under schools,

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,630
we are able to access.

91
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,890
You were display matter from your person.

92
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,100
One object that it's called person wonder display that was working.

93
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,850
Now our matter name has been modified toe underscore underscore display Now if I run the

94
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,550
see the result,

95
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,200
there is no attribute called displayed underscore underscore display.

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,810
So not only for variable.

97
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,570
Even if you are defining method with the pu underscores then that method you cannot access

98
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,350
for more trade off a class then how you can access inside off You were inside off your

99
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,180
anyone off the meta You can call that self lord display.

100
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,650
That's it.

101
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,380
No,

102
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,250
Let me come and this and see the result.

103
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,060
Yes,

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,650
it's working.

105
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,400
Right.

106
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:57,650
So the ice using Oops In Piketon we can restrict access to methods and variables And this

107
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,850
is nothing but simply encapsulation off your bite on hopes concert.

108
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,850
Okay,

109
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,960
so it is also somewhat useful whenever If you want a restrictive,

110
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,350
our data are to excellent word,

111
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,750
Right?

112
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,280
Okay,

113
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,630
Friends,

114
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,320
by this week,

115
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,450
a word core concepts off your pipe on.

116
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,110
And we know that by Tony's popular because off lot off third party models and some default

117
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,110
models right now from no one works.

118
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,570
What I will do is I will update are some important bi fold on third party models on.

119
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,150
After that,

120
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,270
I will do real time practice as well so that it will be good with your piper.

121
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,480
Okay.

122
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,970
Okay,

123
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,220
guys.

124
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,650
Thank you
