1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
friends.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,340
In our previous videos,

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,020
we have seen some off the string operations know based done that sting operations.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:15,750
I'm going to write one simple python script the Huskies display given string at right side

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,850
or left side or center off the line in title for Mark.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,750
Right?

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,260
Let me weapon on either.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,970
So here,

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,650
I'm going to use some blame text as my editor.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,050
Okay,

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,770
So,

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,000
guys,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,330
our tasking display given string on your terminal in a line,

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,970
maybe at right side or left side.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,900
Ordered center indictee.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,350
Former.

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,930
So before going to display.

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,430
First of all,

19
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,150
you should reads some input.

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,650
You should read some string as your input.

21
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,010
You know,

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,210
in bite onto Really?

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,280
Oh,

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,770
string.

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,450
We have a syntax called input.

26
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,140
Right.

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,100
That's what I'm taking given string.

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,730
Whatever.

29
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,150
This thing you're going to provide,

30
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm going to read.

31
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,020
So you have a syntax call in port?

32
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,110
Entry was string.

33
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,550
That's it.

34
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,670
No,

35
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,450
I'm going to print your given string first.

36
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,750
Let me save it.

37
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,300
10 days.

38
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,250
I'm going to run this by transcript from common line because I want to provide input.

39
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,370
So whenever if you want to provide in Portage but had to run your script from Common Line.

40
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,520
Always so.

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,080
The script name which are taken here is a line text R P by now.

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,910
Let me open your skip the first.

43
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,490
Now I'm going to run your script.

44
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,730
It is asking Antonio String.

45
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,060
Yes,

46
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm going to under suppose bite on scripting it is displaying.

47
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,150
This is unpaid language.

48
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,890
This is one line right on that line.

49
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,760
By default,

50
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,590
your python is displaying your string That left side not anywhere.

51
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,650
That is the default format for the whale displaying your data through python.

52
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:03,090
But my requirement is along with dark in the next lane I won't display in a center after

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,270
that,

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,250
I won't display at the right side in a line night.

55
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,880
See if you want to display your string ID right side.

56
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,090
First you have to know how many columns are there in a given line or what is the will it

57
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,710
off that line are someone's If I one display in the middle of a line or center a feline.

58
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,220
First of all,

59
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,540
if I know total number off columns in the line are ripped off your line,

60
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:35,740
then I can divide that into two parts in the middle like in display my string right See for

61
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,760
my windows operating system to know number off columns There is a command called more so

62
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,360
true which there are 1 22 columns are there.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:52,140
That means in each and every line you can write 1 22 characters find if you remember there

64
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,450
is a center operation on a string.

65
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,100
We are discussing this about your strings.

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:08,000
So print my string at center by conserving terminal line with as 1 22 that let me run this

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,470
from command line that authorities displaying in the center off the line Same way I want to

68
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:27,110
display my string Let me bleed given string dot left The just so that is the operation to

69
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:33,830
adjust your string Two words left the site So in a really tough 1 22 right Just are just

70
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,050
your string towards left side Same way If I want to display my string towards right side

71
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:51,200
then on just that's a no Let me go on Come online Let me run it So I'm wondering Fight on

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,050
stripping See the result Because off one prince treatment you're displaying in the middle

73
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,450
or centre on left side and then exactly right side.

74
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,750
Right.

75
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,690
Fine.

76
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,350
We know that by Tony's platform Independent.

77
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,550
All right.

78
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,320
No.

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Let me copy this court and open my Lennox box.

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,370
This is my Lennox books race.

81
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,150
Okay?

82
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,150
No,

83
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:26,820
let me open a script to call and text.

84
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:33,210
R p Y I'm going to copy and paste whatever the cored V ran on the windows operating system

85
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:33,210
.

86
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,580
Let me save it and let me run it.

87
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,160
See the output?

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
Yesterday's asking.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Antonio String.

90
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,250
I'm wondering quite on stripping.

91
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,400
It's it's walking somewhere.

92
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,680
I mean,

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
it's displaying somewhere middle,

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,000
but not exactly in the middle.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,850
But right side left side is working perfectly.

96
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,990
Left aside,

97
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,890
if you see it is displaying your string at left aside,

98
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,290
only some part on the remaining part it is displaying in the next lane.

99
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,650
It's not working properly.

100
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,610
The reason is,

101
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,530
see only what we know.

102
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,110
So operating system for my terminal as off No,

103
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,550
right.

104
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,750
The number of columns are wanting to do,

105
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,250
but on UNIX operating system for this terminal,

106
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,500
the columns may be different.

107
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,960
See that 112 not 1 22 That's why it is not working.

108
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,550
Probably.

109
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:33,650
But you fix of the column values number off columns inside off the script.

110
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,370
Colonel,

111
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,630
will you fix it as 1 22?

112
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,380
That's not correct,

113
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,720
right?

114
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,790
Even maybe on Windows offering system.

115
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,650
Also based on your screen size.

116
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,740
The call number of columns may be very based on my screen size.

117
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,630
It is 1 22 same scoop.

118
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,680
If you run on your windows,

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,280
offering some,

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,010
there is no guarantees that it is going toe off perfectly.

121
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,750
The reason is the columns may be differently.

122
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,630
No up any.

123
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,750
What are US terminal Based on your wonder size?

124
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:11,610
That's why injury fixing the column number off columns in a line or a tougher line as 1 22

125
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,690
If there is any logic to identify automatically,

126
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,150
then it will work properly.

127
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,950
Right City Let me woman quite on terminal.

128
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,330
Yes,

129
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,710
there is a default model or fight on skeptic Always to find out your ways.

130
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:39,690
Information your system information with ways dot get terminal sighs.

131
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,000
So it is going to give both the column stern lines,

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,390
but I need only columns.

133
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,690
Then do one more thing.

134
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,080
DOT Columns right State is giving 1 22 same command.

135
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,190
If you go on the run on my line.

136
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,850
X box.

137
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,450
Let me enter into my part on three.

138
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,650
Right?

139
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,930
I'm gonna bring first.

140
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,150
I'm importing ways.

141
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,290
Then see the result 11 tau.

142
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,650
So python is now automatically identifying the number off columns off your terminal.

143
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,730
So now,

144
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,840
if you use this lousy,

145
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,600
then you're skipping.

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,450
Look perfectly on Eun eternal size.

147
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,440
Right?

148
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,780
So this here don't worry about ways.

149
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,350
Ways is the default model.

150
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,980
So which is useful,

151
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,390
Toto?

152
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,850
Some required operations for that.

153
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,270
You need to write a quality.

154
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,320
Pretty different court is that we're trying to use them.

155
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,720
So we have a separate section for that There.

156
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,330
You can understand very easily what I'm being.

157
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,840
What I'm doing is very first,

158
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,350
I'm going to import waste model.

159
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,380
Then I'm taking a variable called terminal with you can take any variable,

160
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,600
right?

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,850
So get terminal size,

162
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:56,960
then columns the engine of 1 22 right?

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
Simply right,

164
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,570
Colonel,

165
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,750
with that is the variable in their fight on will automatically identify the number off

166
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,720
columns in your line based on your terminal.

167
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Now you can copy this court and exclude on your operating system so that it will look

168
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,900
perfectly right.

169
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,570
Fine.

170
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:17,950
No.

171
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,880
Let me run the score.

172
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,750
and see the result.

173
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,490
Let me under.

174
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,150
Bite on scripting Now it's working perfectly,

175
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,450
right?

176
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,840
Same core.

177
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,140
Let me copy to your Windows operating system on there.

178
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,000
I will run so that he is the editor.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,970
Save it on.

180
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,790
Go to your terminal exit from your potential,

181
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,190
then ran.

182
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,650
You are Olympics.

183
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,380
Yes,

184
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,580
it's working perfectly.

185
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,930
Okay.

186
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,810
But actually our requirement is along with the left,

187
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,390
right and center.

188
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,450
I need to print your string in the title.

189
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:01,900
Former.

190
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,820
You know,

191
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,050
that is the operation called dot Ideal,

192
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,910
not ideal annual string.

193
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,350
So simply a play.

194
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,660
One more operation dot center dot BiDil.

195
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,090
So this will print.

196
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:24,320
They were result in the title for my right for title.

197
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,980
Former is nothing.

198
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,080
Bird in each and every word.

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,850
Starting letter is kept a little.

200
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,120
Let me check it.

201
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,050
I'm providing all our small letters.

202
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,700
No,

203
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:32,840
see,

204
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,020
that is our in each and every word.

205
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,800
Starting lotteries,

206
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,340
Capital,

207
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,450
that's what title former.

208
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,950
Right.

209
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,950
Okay.

210
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,390
Okay,

211
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:42,720
