ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
friends here.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.210
We're going to do simple practice with your platform on ways Models,

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.920
house keys,

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.830
Right.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.960
A single bite transcript to clear colonel off any operating system?

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.700
Oh,

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.520
I can say right.

8
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.150
A black forming new penance.

9
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.160
Crypto clear,

10
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.650
Colonel.

11
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.550
So year.

12
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.960
My intention is I want to write one pie transcript and that by transcript has to run on any

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.390
off your operating system on wild running their escape on your in your anyone off.

14
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.360
You're opening system.

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.570
It has to clear terminal.

16
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.540
That means first let me weapon my windows already System.

17
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.990
Suppose I'm running in this race?

18
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.790
No clear skin means Suppose if I run here by them.

19
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.150
Skip,

20
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.740
it has to No.

21
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.320
In this way,

22
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.850
it has to clear my tunnel.

23
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.050
Same way.

24
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.490
Suppose,

25
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.300
um,

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.490
this is my UNIX are lining system,

27
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.840
right?

28
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.760
If I run your fight unscripted here,

29
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.210
it has toe clear a screen.

30
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.350
It has to do in this way.

31
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.870
So in that way,

32
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.350
anything,

33
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.150
even my script CJ's by default to clear your eternal suppose as off?

34
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.360
No.

35
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.970
Based on our previous concept,

36
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.790
Suppose we don't have any Wouldn't see any common in Piketon directly.

37
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.640
But we know one thing from ways model weekend.

38
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.700
Run any or burning system command,

39
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.520
right?

40
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.150
That's why what I'm doing is I'm writing a simple bite on school,

41
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.210
right?

42
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.750
The least clear screen.

43
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.580
Let's directly you can clear command on your UNIX like systems are in the sea.

44
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.160
Let's come in on your Windows operating system but to provide some idea to use your

45
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.100
different models to work with your different models.

46
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.650
I'm taking this simple example,

47
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.950
right clear screen dot Be white.

48
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.310
See,

49
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.300
I can import.

50
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.450
I can import wears model.

51
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.550
Right?

52
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.490
See you produce UNIX like systems I had to run.

53
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.710
Where's your system?

54
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.110
Seal year common and every day's windows.

55
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.440
I hope.

56
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.950
Run,

57
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.350
See a list comer.

58
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.120
See,

59
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.370
my intention is I want to write one pipe landscape on it has to work with all operating

60
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.050
systems.

61
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:23.290
Suppose if I take only with our system and then clear right then it will work with only

62
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.330
were UNIX like systems.

63
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.850
Let me run this bite on three.

64
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.490
Our first ofall randomly.

65
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.060
Right now I'm going to run your script.

66
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Fight on three,

67
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.280
then clear screen.

68
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.900
Yes,

69
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.950
it's clearing your screen,

70
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.300
but same skip.

71
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.450
I want to copy.

72
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.990
Do your windows offering system.

73
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.900
There I want to run.

74
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.040
Let me do it.

75
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.850
One thing we am Juliette screen dot Be way.

76
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.370
So here.

77
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.810
I'm going to copy whatever the core you're having here,

78
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.950
let me copy that chord.

79
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.310
So this court I'm copying and I'm going to paste it on your windows,

80
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.850
right?

81
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.450
No,

82
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.670
See,

83
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.130
the let me say we on Let me run it by done on windows,

84
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.520
you know,

85
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.450
bite on his death.

86
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.420
Clear sting.

87
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.050
So you're getting another clear is not recognized on internal or external common because

88
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.710
you are command is for UNIX,

89
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.210
like systems.

90
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.250
Not for the news.

91
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.900
No,

92
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.750
What I would do.

93
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.450
You know what If you're running from windows,

94
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.370
right?

95
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.750
An ignorant See,

96
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.230
listen,

97
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.850
giraffe C l e a r right.

98
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.190
But because of this modification,

99
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.780
you have two different scripts.

100
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.450
So this is where door system see,

101
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.920
Ellis.

102
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.450
But the way the system seal year,

103
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.020
But what I hope,

104
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.650
please.

105
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.410
I hope to run this same skipped on windows as well as your other UNIX like systems so that

106
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.250
it has to work,

107
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.550
then see their first of all,

108
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.940
I am writing Saudi.

109
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.890
I'm writing both the common CIA.

110
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.520
Where's dot system See,

111
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.450
A year or clear and then wears our system CLS.

112
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.820
But I want to run this command.

113
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.080
If it is in expect systems,

114
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.750
I want to run this command.

115
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.520
If it is Windows operating system,

116
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.180
right.

117
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.890
Suppose first I will take CLS,

118
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.590
then second,

119
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.980
I will do it.

120
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.250
Clear.

121
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.820
So you guys,

122
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.750
if you remember,

123
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.550
you can identify your operating system name from this model platform model.

124
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.660
Right?

125
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.950
See,

126
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.550
what I'm doing is if platform doors windows Sorry system.

127
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.300
If it is equals to Windows,

128
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.940
then I'm going to run ways,

129
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.330
door system,

130
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.200
fearless else.

131
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.030
I'm running with your system,

132
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.690
Celia.

133
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.970
I see how it is going to work.

134
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.480
You know,

135
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.390
platform that system is going to do.

136
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.690
You're operating system name on which you are running your python scripts.

137
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.310
Suppose if I run this kept on my windows offering system,

138
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.560
then this value becomes windows.

139
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.850
If it is true,

140
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.250
you know your python.

141
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.810
If condition is Allah,

142
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.920
be,

143
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.850
exclude this line and you know,

144
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.460
in NFL's if if condition is true,

145
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.350
then by default,

146
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.430
else is going to skip same skip.

147
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.210
Just assume that you're going to run on your UNIX like systems.

148
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.740
Whenever.

149
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.450
If you're running this clip on your next like systems this world live is your Lennox,

150
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.860
then this is false,

151
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.150
right?

152
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.600
If it is false,

153
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.150
then if doesn't hollow to exclude this line on If this is false biting fold without

154
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.910
checking any condition else block will excuse.

155
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.700
Right now I'm copying this court.

156
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.190
First of all,

157
00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:02.050
let me run this on your We knows operating system s something.

158
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.830
Yes.

159
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.940
Well,

160
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.310
yes,

161
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.500
yes.

162
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.030
Spelling mistake.

163
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.410
Grace,

164
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.750
It's my back.

165
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.270
Yes way.

166
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.570
Yes.

167
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.250
Diem.

168
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.800
Yeah,

169
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.270
it's got it.

170
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.650
Here,

171
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.850
let me run you a script,

172
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.860
right?

173
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.890
This clearing your screen,

174
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.740
same court,

175
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.200
whatever.

176
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.230
You how here,

177
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.970
That court.

178
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.150
I'm going to copy it and paste it on your UNIX like systems.

179
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.810
Right?

180
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.300
See,

181
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.170
let me weapon before that,

182
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.800
let me nullify your previous data and I'm going toe open your clear screen Skip and I'm

183
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.140
simply copying and paste.

184
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.900
You are score from your Windows operating system.

185
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.350
Now I'm going to run these.

186
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.210
It's clearing,

187
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.970
right Cigarettes.

188
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:48.640
Be clear.

189
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.850
So here I used the concept off your voice and flat for models along with your if else

190
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.350
concept.

191
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.690
So now this is a platform independent script this cape you can use on any operating system

192
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.950
such that it is going to clear your eternal.

193
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.290
So one skip,

194
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.350
it is going to work with all operating systems.

195
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.750
Right?

196
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.200
So there is the simple script toe Clearly what,

197
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.720
Colonel?

198
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.960
And it is a platform in the peninsula.

199
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.500
So that is important days here.

200
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.150
So anybody for writing by landscape,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.110
right on in your real time.

You have multiple operating systems,

203
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.280
then.

204
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.900
You're right.

205
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.650
You're by towns.

206
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.850
Keep such a way that it has to work with your all operating systems.

207
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.750
Right.

208
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.080
Okay.
