1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
friends here.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:01,790
Our concept,

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,980
these class and object attributes See Ali,

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,070
we know simply what is a class So class is a template or blueprint to create an object.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,860
So once if you have a template from there we can create any number of objects on classes,

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,210
the combination off attributes and metres.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,440
So basically our tributes are like variables and we can define attributes for class on

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,200
objects.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,820
I mean,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,850
for class level,

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,340
we can define some variables and for object level,

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,650
we can defend some variables.

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,750
Let me explain this concert with help off a symbol by transcript.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,250
So I'm saving my script name as working on at Labour's Don't be white.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,390
So they suppose I'm writing a simple by Tom skipped our program to maintain the data for

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,860
implies supple agenda.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,680
For time being,

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,750
we're having some two implies,

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,550
right?

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,250
Then I won't do maintain the later for these two employees.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,710
Then before going to maintain the data first,

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,190
I will assume I'm going to create one template.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,580
So I want to store so on.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,890
So things for employees,

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,920
right?

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,610
So then what?

27
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm doing this glass simply employed that's a cooler than enter.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,290
So I'm refining one meter to store the employees Name is on salary.

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,280
Suppose so.

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:41,900
Let me define as I get Name is salary Not so actually this is a function.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,880
But if anybody if you want to write a function inside off a class you have to write bitey

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,210
for itself as the key.

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,020
And you don't need to worry aboard the value for self automatically Self will be replaced

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,340
by the particular object from which object you're calling.

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,450
That object will come in the place off self.

36
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,600
That's fine.

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,980
Now you're expecting for this function?

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,260
Name is and salary.

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,270
Let me take variables as I mean.

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,460
I will pass arguments for this method.

41
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,950
Will calling are like name is on salary.

42
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,850
Nothing.

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:19,220
Then I want to store this name is and Salvi in the memory location.

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,600
So for that you had to write self door name equals to name So guys don't get confused.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,950
Self dot name is different and name is different.

46
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,750
It is like X y equals to white.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,050
Completed their different variables.

48
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,650
Right then,

49
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,250
Self lord,

50
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,630
is it closed?

51
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,070
Toe is so if you're getting confusion,

52
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,820
just take hear arguments as different variables.

53
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm in different names like Yes,

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,600
yes,

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,150
yes.

56
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,020
But if you take name,

57
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,050
age and Sally just from what meaningful that I'm taking arguments as a name is and salary

58
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,550
then self Lord salary Not.

59
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,650
Then I'm going to define one motor of function just to display the implied the dates.

60
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:15,510
Then what I can do Display employees de days are simply display details Self so actually to

61
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,070
display employee details What we need name is and soundly so if you're using normal

62
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,020
function like a display details if it is a normal function toe,

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,060
get your details.

64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,330
You need to pass arguments,

65
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,120
toe dysfunction.

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,290
But this is a matter.

67
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,840
And if you did,

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,050
these two metres are in the same class.

69
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,950
That's why whatever the variables you are having,

70
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,510
you define any word.

71
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,800
First matter,

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,200
those variables you can access in other methods.

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,720
That's why I'm not passing any arguments to display details matter that attack and access

74
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,950
from my previous mentor.

75
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,470
So that fidelity,

76
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,980
what I'm doing is simply print.

77
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:03,010
The name is so simply here I will write name name is nothing but self lord name but not

78
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,440
this name.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,280
Grace this your passing toe this matter while calling okay,

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,950
but actually variables are our tributes for your objects Are these things?

81
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:22,580
Then let me right slash n that is these we can write anything.

82
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,170
No bowling.

83
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,350
Just for out.

84
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,180
For your understanding.

85
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,250
I'm writing simple script.

86
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:34,770
Then they salary is that's it Looks great.

87
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,220
Salary,

88
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,110
self A lot salary right then,

89
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,340
right.

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,850
Simply return none.

91
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,750
So I'm not expecting any return value from this matter.

92
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,630
So he had also I'm not expecting any Britain value.

93
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,240
That's why I'm writing.

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,090
Simply return none.

95
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,450
That's fine.

96
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,730
So if you run,

97
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,530
your court has off.

98
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:56,830
No,

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,270
you're not getting any output and you're not going to get any better because there's just

100
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,040
template number won't eggs good whenever.

101
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,620
If you run,

102
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,490
it will exclude whenever.

103
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,050
If you are signed this template to any object night.

104
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,050
That's fine.

105
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,820
No,

106
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,250
See that?

107
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,880
Yes,

108
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,850
I do know that we're having to implies Let's say employees one unemployed toe.

109
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,550
Okay.

110
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,850
No,

111
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,150
I want to store the details for employees.

112
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,540
One unemployed doom When I want to see you where nobody find need so to store we how this

113
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,450
method on toe display we have this matter second method,

114
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,450
right?

115
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,520
So So instead of get let me a sign our Yeah,

116
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,200
Noble.

117
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,020
You can take any metal,

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,250
right?

119
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,850
So imply you one.

120
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,180
So before going to store employees one day days what?

121
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,450
You have to go for stuff All you need to assign this template for this object,

122
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,990
right?

123
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,950
Then only this methods and this attributes are variables you can access from employees One

124
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,650
That's why what I'm doing first time doing employees then for employees one and employ to

125
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,550
That's it.

126
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,180
Right?

127
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,380
So,

128
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,600
guys,

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,300
as off No,

130
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,050
you how imply You won and employ two objects.

131
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,200
But there is no information for employees one unemployed toe Because if you exclude anyone

132
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,530
of them,

133
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,460
Attard then only are going toe store your data supposed to story or did I heartaches?

134
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,240
Could this matter?

135
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,110
But you need to call that method You know how to column matter off your class Now a gender

136
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,840
This entire class this template is touring the name off employees one on employee toe so

137
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,790
that nobody if you call from employ you one employees,

138
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,400
You one get name,

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
age and salary.

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,850
Let's say I'm giving us suppose name Anything like John.

141
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,960
Hey,

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,350
supposed 34 then I'm giving silently as something like,

143
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,050
Yes,

144
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,400
I know it may be 45,000 per month.

145
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,010
Just a union,

146
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,950
Right?

147
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,710
Fine,

148
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,250
No.

149
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,500
The same day.

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,300
I want to store my data.

151
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,520
My employ to data.

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,650
Then just right.

153
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:33,790
That's it.

154
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,150
Okay.

155
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,810
Now,

156
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,240
if I execute well running your program somewhere in memory,

157
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,610
location to memory blocks will be created.

158
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,820
One memory block for employees one on second memory is for employees Toe night on.

159
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,350
See before calling your display.

160
00:07:51,350 --> 00:08:00,250
If I write the a r off employees of one see the result what you're getting basically for

161
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,430
employees one.

162
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,350
What are the information's you're having name?

163
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:11,090
I mean this method on variables right on One more method here Now see that would put

164
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,150
anybody are These are the default values I have done that.

165
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,710
See,

166
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,290
that is there Name is there.

167
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,170
Sally's there.

168
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:25,500
So employees wonder is employees One darts name employee wondered salary The same way you

169
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,150
can use this is the method is to other metals.

170
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,450
We know that by during here we can understand that these two are matters So imply wonder

171
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:40,100
display details imply one don't get name is salary but we're calling if you need arguments

172
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,200
in it to pass the same,

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:51,730
we can also run this for employ to same information is there for employees to also.

174
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,950
But the values are different.

175
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,250
That's a no fine.

176
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,910
Just observe these guys.

177
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:06,730
Why are you calling from your 14th line or imply you one get name is salary Jon 34 45,000

178
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,120
values will be assigned to respectively.

179
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,250
Name is and salary than What about self self By default from which object you're calling

180
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,290
that object name will be stored in the self.

181
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,370
That's why in memory it is going to create,

182
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,750
like employees one dot name,

183
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,150
not self dot name.

184
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,820
Okay,

185
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,450
for our purpose for our enemy Corpus were writing self,

186
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,360
but while storing your values,

187
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,330
your variables in memory location,

188
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,940
they're going to store in the respect by using employees one in play,

189
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
one dot name in play,

190
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,110
one dot age and play one.

191
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,680
Not salary,

192
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,420
nothing and one more thing,

193
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,650
but never if you're accessing,

194
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,490
you're variables inside off a class.

195
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,690
Always you have to take self dot name.

196
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,650
Self got a self not Sally like that,

197
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,950
but for same imply you one.

198
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:59,240
If you want to access your variables and the roads outside off a class outside of a class,

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,240
then you have to access with imply,

200
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,030
you wondered,

201
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,530
not self.

202
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,320
Not be clear outside the hard to access with the employees.

203
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,500
One dot suppose I wonder.

204
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,370
Display age.

205
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,870
So that is what you're getting.

206
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,440
34

207
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,250
That's fine.

208
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,810
I left the Abdur even method.

209
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,930
We're also calling us employees Wonder.

210
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,100
Suppose if I want to call display method.

211
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,090
How can I call Imply you one dot display details.

212
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,530
That's it.

213
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,630
If you observe displayed details is not requiring any arguments.

214
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,300
It is not taking any arguments except self anywhere.

215
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,970
Self is going toe store with the help of employees.

216
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,250
One.

217
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,530
M play One name will store in yourself.

218
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,370
That's why we are Boston character arguments.

219
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,890
Where you calling display Minter Not just after the result.

220
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,750
And one more thing you are calling your method outside off a class.

221
00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:01,470
Suppose I want toe display My details offer Assigning the data to yourself dot name is,

222
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:01,950
and sadly,

223
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,440
then you have to call this matter inside of this foster matter.

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,280
So whenever if you want to call liver matter inside off a matter,

225
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:17,510
then you have the right cell for Lord met her name so self means outside a connection.

226
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,270
This is like employees one but inside off a class if you want to call,

227
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,800
and if you want,

228
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,600
exclude any matter you have to write self dot Now let me come in days and see the result.

229
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,370
You're going to get display details for two implies.

230
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,800
See that first you're assigning because of star 14 50 lines you're assigning your values

231
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,420
for your attributes are variables.

232
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,280
Then immediately,

233
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,710
you're calling the respect to objector display.

234
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,550
Details matter.

235
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,100
That's why you're going to get the same values in output.

236
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,750
Not there are signing on.

237
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,850
Then you are displaying.

238
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,190
That's it.

239
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,950
So be clear if you want to execute a matar inside off a class,

240
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,050
you had to write self door,

241
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,850
but outside off a class you had to write your object name dot that matter name.

242
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,390
That's fine.

243
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,410
And if you abduct this entire program,

244
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,570
you are having these or,

245
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:03,830
like,

246
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,140
attributes right on this attribute.

247
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,650
This attributes are specific for Butler object because we're writing self dot,

248
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,550
so it is nothing without that name.

249
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,930
So these are tributes.

250
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,550
Are the letter for your object?

251
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,350
That's fine?

252
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,750
No.

253
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,640
What?

254
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,930
I have a small requirement off the creation off after creation off your objects.

255
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,570
I need to find at last how many employee objects has been clear.

256
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:45,570
Did using this template how many employee objects has been created by using this template?

257
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,850
I hope to know that Count.

258
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,650
I need to find out.

259
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,150
Hey,

260
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:53,720
what I'm doing is I am writing comb count because initially,

261
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,110
Jiro.

262
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,150
So whenever if I create employees one at that time,

263
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,160
I need to increase this value and it increased this value.

264
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,350
This value is not related with your object.

265
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,790
This is ready with your template.

266
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,680
Your class this class variable.

267
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,180
See that?

268
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,440
If I want to access that variable from outside off your class,

269
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,500
I need to access with the employees dot com.

270
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
What is employees here?

271
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,850
Class Name?

272
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,600
Joe,

273
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,350
you're getting Let me come in tow biting for calling this president's right.

274
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,850
I was just just absurd output.

275
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,150
They're getting digital,

276
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,150
right?

277
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,200
I can increase this value at any time.

278
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,850
Maybe inside off a class inside off a method are outside off a classy I am going in

279
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:47,050
employees dot county cause to employ dot cone Blessed one.

280
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,960
So after that,

281
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,680
I am printing my employees Cone,

282
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,510
that's a not this variable.

283
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,880
If we defend any variable outside off your methods without self.

284
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,350
Then that is for you.

285
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:08,580
Template for your class rt built That is class rt vote now.

286
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,330
What I'm doing is I'm taking the help off this variable on whenever.

287
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,210
If I create an absurd at that time,

288
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,270
I will increase this value.

289
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,450
I can increase either inside off a class,

290
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,500
are inside off emitter or outside of him class.

291
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,250
See how I'm going to do that.

292
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,930
So you were never If I create this values right,

293
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,480
that means you're creating an object,

294
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:29,770
right?

295
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,350
So India's I'm I'm going to create one more method.

296
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,600
You can create any method.

297
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,030
I mean,

298
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:43,350
like increased count Increase combed for employ not for your object,

299
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,130
but memories were writing inside off your class.

300
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,650
Right?

301
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,780
See,

302
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,550
what I'm doing is simply amazing.

303
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,200
Employee,

304
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,300
this is the class name.

305
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,950
Then count equals toe employed or cone plus one.

306
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,900
Of course,

307
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,550
you can also read your shortcut for your automatic operation.

308
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,080
Then simply return none.

309
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,650
That's it,

310
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:11,890
See?

311
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,660
But I need toe manually.

312
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,350
Run this.

313
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,860
I mean exclude this method whenever if I create an object.

314
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,220
So I mean after giving your name,

315
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,550
age and Sally for any employee offer that I need to call employees one door.

316
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,700
Increase cone for employees,

317
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,720
then implied,

318
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,090
too.

319
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,170
No increase.

320
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,960
Gone for M blade.

321
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,450
That's it.

322
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:37,680
No,

323
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:37,820
see,

324
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,270
that isn't.

325
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,280
Yeah,

326
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,900
let me bring.

327
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:48,210
So they're gonna just for So what is the variable employees dot com through the desert to

328
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,450
wearables has been started to object has been created by using this template.

329
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,650
I don't understand.

330
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,910
This variable normal variable rate like X equals to something County coast,

331
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,390
Ojito.

332
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,880
Not the if you defined.

333
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,190
Available immediately after writing your class class name.

334
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,590
If you defend any variable.

335
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,700
Right that available is written for the work class.

336
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,450
So this is called class attribute.

337
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,820
So why we way?

338
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,640
We need class.

339
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,220
Our tribute meets How many?

340
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,720
Suppose one of the example I'm giving.

341
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,850
But you can defend a number of variables based on your requirement.

342
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,990
The very simple thing I'm giving is from the template.

343
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,010
How many objects has been cleared to count that I'm defending one variable when I triple

344
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,650
called com.

345
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,450
That's it.

346
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,680
So if you don't want to call externally,

347
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,390
you are increased corn for employees just coming.

348
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,150
These two methods here.

349
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,400
So anybody if it created were variables immediately called Self Lord.

350
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,460
Increase count for employees.

351
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,720
That's it.

352
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,760
You can see that is a same old would write to your getting.

353
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,700
Okay,

354
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,630
So this this is Allah boat simply class and object.

355
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,310
Attributes Be clear.

356
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,970
These are class obsessed dirty boots and this is for your class.

357
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,590
Are people on?

358
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,890
Remember that class are too boots.

359
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:14,980
We hope to call our We have to save like self dot You are variable name Even when

360
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,260
displaying that we had to take selfies are that is only inside off a class.

361
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,630
But if it come outside,
