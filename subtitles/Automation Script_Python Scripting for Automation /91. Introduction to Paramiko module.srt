1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
friends here.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,980
Our concept is working with remote Lennox,

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,000
our work from Lennox or Windows as your local host by using para Mike off python.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,800
See,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,550
you're having one remote server and there is a line,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,300
except when you are having a local server and this local server,

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,150
maybe windows are maybe Lennox.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,120
And from here I need to walk with your remorse,

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,920
our world by using pattern Michael off python,

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,230
right?

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,740
This is our concept of year.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,470
But before going to work with that,

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,950
let me do some introduction to your partner Michael Model.

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,300
The first ofall para Michael is your fight on model or library,

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,580
which is useful to work with the world remote servers See working with your remote servers

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:43,580
.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,050
Meat.

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,620
Sometimes you need to excuse some comments on your reward server.

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,410
We thought logging into that from your local server or sometimes injured transferring file

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,190
from locals are over to a remote server.

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,220
Are are sometimes you don't know they filed from remorse over to locals.

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,450
So all these actions we can perform with help off bite on para Michael model.

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,650
But before going to use that,

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:13,070
you should have a Asus such or s a set you free to protocol on your local server are simply

25
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,210
from where you're running your fight on for their usual.

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,550
How?

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,190
Under the operating system issued out as a sexually do protocol.

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,950
That's it.

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,080
Sundays.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,550
We know that by default we have such a protocol on you are indexed like systems.

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,930
If your local salaries were knows unity,

32
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,550
check 40.

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,690
What?

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,150
Ssh!

35
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,900
If it is not very hard to install it,

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,360
right,

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,150
that's fine.

38
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,210
Then how it is going to work,

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,250
how you are quite right on Part of my committee is going to work.

40
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,020
See your pal bite on para Michael.

41
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,950
Model is going to create a static line first,

42
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,590
with all popular as a such A to protocol,

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,630
I'm in a century to protocol on by using that it is going toe connect with your the more

44
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,250
servers and it is going to work.

45
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,530
Working means excluding command.

46
00:01:59,530 --> 00:01:59,810
Son,

47
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,950
Transferring face.

48
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,350
That's fine.

49
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,070
No,

50
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,620
for authentication purpose.

51
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,950
Your partner Michael is using two ways one is using.

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,860
Use a name one passport earn 2nd 1 is using user name or we were keys.

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,360
I mean,

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,080
user name on the work ease on days.

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,750
Finally,

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,340
the last point for your indirection is we can connect from lie next to Lennox Orland,

57
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,850
Extra windows or windows to Lennox are windows to windows using your pattern Michael model

58
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:28,850
.

59
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,960
So we have four combinations,

60
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,300
right?

61
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,900
Let me write all combinations here.

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,380
Suppose local.

63
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,410
Let me right here.

64
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:37,950
In this way,

65
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,950
locals are were.

66
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,250
Then you were remorse or words.

67
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,010
So locals ever maybe Windows and you were remote.

68
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,580
Server left.

69
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,350
You let me do all the commission windows,

70
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,390
servers or local surgeries.

71
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,710
Windows on remote servers.

72
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,220
Maybe line.

73
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,900
Except for us.

74
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,970
No local server.

75
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,950
Maybe Lennox.

76
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,530
Windows server,

77
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,650
maybe Lennox.

78
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,210
Or it is line X on windows remorse over his windows.

79
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:18,110
So these four combination will works with your part of Michael model on here.

80
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,050
For time being,

81
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,020
we are going to work with by conserving your local Sarfaraz windows or land X on your

82
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,750
remorse Surgeries only Lennox.

83
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,380
Right?

84
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,130
So first I'm going toe cancer local server.

85
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,250
As Lennox,

86
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:41,450
the mortar also links.

87
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:50,380
Second will work by conserving local as windows and remorse are Islamics.

88
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,150
That's fine.

89
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,650
No,

90
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:52,840
guys,

91
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
before going to use your para Michael,

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,230
The first thing is you should have a sausage on your local host.

93
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,200
Let me check.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,450
Suppose this is my locals are were Ah,

95
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:13,920
from my remember like many more.

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,790
This fine.

97
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,950
I'll see yet?

98
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,760
Yes,

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
I have a message then.

100
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,750
No problem.

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,350
We have a message.

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,550
Then we can work with your pipes on Para Michael on one more thing.

103
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,550
Just check it whether we help out on my core north.

104
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,570
So,

105
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:30,840
you know,

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,690
help out of Michael.

107
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,070
Anyway,

108
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,090
this is not not the default model.

109
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,680
So if it is not there on your horse than unity installed say,

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,390
let me show you on my windows support.

111
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,610
See,

112
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,410
I tried to import para Michael here.

113
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,700
There is no name.

114
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,130
Calm bottom,

115
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,580
EKO.

116
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,750
I mean no model named Marimekko.

117
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,330
Then That's why what I did here is simply I installed with help off Pip Pip,

118
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,330
install paramedical.

119
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,520
Same thing you can follow on your landing system as well to install.

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,580
What better,

121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,980
Michael?

122
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,650
That's fine.

123
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,830
So offer in selling my importer,

124
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,960
then there is no era.

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,650
That's fine.

126
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,810
So if it is not there,

127
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,940
you had to install you.

128
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,150
What part of Michael model.

129
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,610
So I'm giving you simply hear steps,

130
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,210
Pip,

131
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,280
install para my cope to install your para Michael model.

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,950
That's fine.

133
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,100
then.

134
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,950
Second thing is how you are.

135
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,860
Yeah.

136
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,480
So let me start with the court to use your power,

137
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,980
Michael,

138
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,750
to work with your remorse hours.

139
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,170
Let me write a simple core here.

140
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,880
Sorry.

141
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,370
Not this is this is my local server.

142
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,350
Let me exit from here working with the more Lennox.

143
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,720
Maybe any server remorse that actually any so even work with any remorse or work?

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Of course.

145
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,380
More timing.

146
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,640
We are went to work with only remorse.

147
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,550
Auroras Lennox.

148
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,700
Yeah,

149
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,310
One more thing.

150
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,030
Let me take,

151
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,450
uh,

152
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,950
my bite on pot.

153
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:03,450
See that?

154
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,480
The very first thing unity,

155
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,200
important part of my co model.

156
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,180
That's fine.

157
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,250
So after that,

158
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,430
you're para Michael is going to work with the remorse,

159
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,740
or worse,

160
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,860
by creating a claim.

161
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,300
Actually,

162
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,530
we need to create that climb.

163
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,060
So to create your client,

164
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,750
this is the syntax.

165
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,150
So here.

166
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,200
Nice.

167
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,340
I will do all these steps on the bill off the serial.

168
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,350
Then you can go with that and you can practice.

169
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,330
So this is simply any variable,

170
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,930
but this is your client s a search plane.

171
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,160
Simply You can assume associates off your operating system now.

172
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,900
I creator from Baron my CO.

173
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,940
This s a static line.

174
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,550
Be clear.

175
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,450
This is a variable.

176
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,810
You can take any name,

177
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,010
but I'll get our take insurable name.

178
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,950
So after that,

179
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,850
let me try Toe carried with my remote server.

180
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,810
Soto can it with your remote,

181
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,000
sir,

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,500
where we have a syntax core.

183
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,140
I mean,

184
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,300
anywhere we have to procedures when he's using user name and password.

185
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,550
2nd 1 is using user name one kiss.

186
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,600
So for timing,

187
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,820
for time being,

188
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm going to use user name and password.

189
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,610
So let me take my remorse or host name first.

190
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:13,990
So good.

191
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,520
These are syntax simply as a sage.

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,250
Not connect.

193
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,410
You're remorse.

194
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,200
Our host name with what user And what is the password on?

195
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,010
By default,

196
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,060
it is going to use port only do only you no need to mention.

197
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,990
But if you want to mention you can mention it No,

198
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,550
Let me open my remote server.

199
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,000
So for this remorse or what?

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,100
This is a public I p no,

201
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,040
I mean host name.

202
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,680
You can also mention in your real time f Korean name off your server.

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,960
That's fine.

204
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,700
User name is this one and I have given already password us But I'm Michael 123 I think.

205
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,300
Let me check it.

206
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,550
Our Michael.

207
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,830
123 Let me save it underneath this.

208
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,920
So before going to run,

209
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,050
let me property execution permission Because we are online X.

210
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,190
See that you're getting another called para my code.

211
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,950
Or as a such exceptions,

212
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,640
Andi,

213
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,350
if you have very here not phone in known host,

214
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,680
see whenever If you try to connect with any remorse of what?

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,650
Using your restaurants that very first time.

216
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,620
So let me show you.

217
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,240
That is a such so.

218
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,110
But this is my course name.

219
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,080
See,

220
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,010
it is going to ask yes or no permission,

221
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,450
right so manually in New York and bring here but in pipelines could We are not entering

222
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,540
that Yes or no option.

223
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,200
If you say yes,

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,700
then only can,

225
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,000
can it?

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,510
If you say no,

227
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,060
you are Windows A No.

228
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,500
If you don't want to ask this right in your shur,

229
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,220
providing some stick to host to keep checking as no right.

230
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,330
But in spite on how we can aware that taking this whole sticky ticking right symbol you

231
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:52,400
know,

232
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,450
Darda on our policy tow away that I don't want to check yes or no confirmation by default.

233
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,930
I want to work with that given server.

234
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,230
So for that,

235
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,010
you need to ard this line before going toe current with your remote server.

236
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,550
That's it,

237
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,250
right?

238
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,090
No,

239
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,890
you fight one days.

240
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,140
No,

241
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,450
you're not going to get any better.

242
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,650
Just let me run this and see the reserved.

243
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,490
That's it.

244
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,250
You're not getting in error means.

245
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,220
And now you're Skip.

246
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,360
Has bean connected with you?

247
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,850
I mean,

248
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,300
true Skip,

249
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,360
You have been connected with your remote server,

250
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
this server.

251
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,630
So,

252
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,830
guys,

253
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,620
the connection.

254
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,090
Whatever the connection you established with your remorse,

255
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,270
sir,

256
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,010
Where will be there with this?

257
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:42,560
Ssh object only not to exclude any commands or to transfer a file for all those things.

258
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
You have to use this.

259
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,150
Ssh.

260
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,880
Now,

261
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,870
let me use this toe.

262
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,510
Exclude some comments so simply to exclude your commands.

263
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,630
He hard to write a society dot Yeah.

264
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,530
One more thing you can,

265
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:56,910
right?

266
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,270
I mean,

267
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,810
you can exclude any common here yet you see,

268
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,750
execute.

269
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
Come on.

270
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,100
But before that,

271
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,450
if you are running some commands on your remorse that were sometimes you may need some

272
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,650
input to provide that I'm in tow to provide input for that command.

273
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,010
are some.

274
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,960
Forget a body.

275
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,380
Ah,

276
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,050
board input.

277
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,040
Sometimes you're going to get such a southport.

278
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,190
Sometimes you're going to get better or put well running your common while excluding your

279
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:30,330
command only what remote server that for here we're having to exclude our command Is the

280
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,860
syntax you can take any?

281
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,070
Come,

282
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,650
I suppose I'm running to gaze.

283
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,550
I am using ssh to execute our commands on your remote server.

284
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,350
Right on.

285
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,450
If you have dirty here,

286
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,080
this command I mean,

287
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,430
after running this command,

288
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,050
you may get some success off if you got success that is going to store into this variable

289
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,280
If you get another by learning this command that are put with store into this If you get

290
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,910
output original empty if you get better.

291
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,770
Artisanal,

292
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,050
then what is the use off this STD in?

293
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,650
See why learning your commands on your remote server Sometimes that come and may need input

294
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:10,650
.

295
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,500
Let's say you're running some pseudo comer and so combined.

296
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,560
Sometimes you need pass.

297
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Were that possible?

298
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,450
We can provide with help off STD in.

299
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,650
Okay,

300
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,870
So working with the STD and we will see in the letter videos as off.

301
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,120
No,

302
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,450
I'm goingto take only s to the older near Syria,

303
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,150
I think is that I'm running my command in this way.

304
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,120
Then let me reinforce Very simple common.

305
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,480
Suppose I want to get who I'm my first.

306
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,630
Let me do invalid.

307
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:39,980
Come in.

308
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,250
Right.

309
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,710
So you actually,

310
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,650
my intention is I'm trying to cow find with water user reconnected We know that we can

311
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,390
agree with this user.

312
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,550
Only that are But actually we are expecting.

313
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,920
But these invalid command that's what you're going to get another that there will be there

314
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,340
in this on these two STD openess to the in,

315
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,720
they are like file objects.

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,760
So if you know if you remember how to read a content from file object by using dot read or

317
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,750
don't read lines,

318
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,950
let me write first.

319
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:23,090
The output is in case if you have it or put on let me bring the arteries.

320
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,790
No,

321
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm going to print a year.

322
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
The success or putting?

323
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,750
Guess if we if we how that out s to the old daughter three.

324
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:38,550
Then in case if you get an error error that we're going to print here STD error or not read

325
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,550
.

326
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,850
Let me save it and let me run this.

327
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,590
See the output?

328
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,710
What happened in better discern backs brained Astrid Arabia?

329
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,780
We have gone one extra parent assists.

330
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,450
I think.

331
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,110
No,

332
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,700
it's fine.

333
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,110
See output?

334
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,190
You're getting an empty.

335
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:08,250
But every are getting something because the common whatever we have given that is invalid.

336
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,560
Common.

337
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,230
That's what he's saying.

338
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,250
Come and not for what We're getting another.

339
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,950
And if you after you're also getting an empty empty line because this is the file content,

340
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,300
right?

341
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,650
If you really file content by the fall for each and every line at the end,

342
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,490
you have a slash in.

343
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,390
So for this line,

344
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:23,610
also,

345
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,690
you're having at the insulation that we're getting this.

346
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:31,750
Now you can do something not only really can also write read lines information,

347
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:37,870
but if you remember while working with files ah,

348
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,850
read lines is a list off values.

349
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,120
I mean simply,

350
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,770
you are filed.

351
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,050
Content will be converted into number off by losing your list.

352
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:58,130
Each lane is a one value in what list not see that slashing is there by any,

353
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,710
but that's fine.

354
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,870
Based on your requirement,

355
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,950
you can go with the read or read lines.

356
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,100
Now let me you a valued common Let's say who are my who?

357
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,070
I know this is a valid command,

358
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,350
right?

359
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,170
No.

360
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,850
See the result?

361
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,510
Yes,

362
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:15,700
you do,

363
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,040
User.

364
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,060
But our parties I'm in error but is empty because you got success or Bertoia.

365
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,750
Raise Mt.

366
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,070
Right.

367
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,710
Let's forget about input.

368
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,400
STD in.

369
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,760
But syntax is yard to use.

370
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,360
A steady income.

371
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,850
My sturdy old common yesterday era.

372
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,320
That's fine.

373
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,720
Now let me run one more common.

374
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,800
You condone any common?

375
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,300
Let me come in this Let me write same syntax.

376
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,850
Suppose I am running.

377
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,220
Let's say up time.

378
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,550
Say we don't money and see the result.

379
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,000
Not so right.

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,450
So not only that.

381
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:05,070
Let me exclude one more thing like free hyphen e Um see the result?

382
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,950
That's it,

383
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,250
right?

384
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,170
You know what you are getting here?

385
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,920
OK,

386
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,580
history out.

387
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,350
Read line,

388
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,450
not lines.

389
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,130
Right?

390
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,730
So that's why you gotta I mean,

391
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,670
you're not getting perfect output read lines.

392
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,650
He's going to do all the lines from your content.

393
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,900
So previously I use only read line,

394
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,060
No cedar tree lines.

395
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,690
You're going to get complete or put for You were free iPhone.

396
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:35,910
Yeah,

397
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,340
that's fine.

398
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,550
So there's There's a simple way to exclude your comments on your remote server on.

399
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,020
But here we are using user name and password on one more thing.

400
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,340
Our local salaries Lennox.

401
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,750
And the more stories also Lennox.

402
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,860
Now let me execute same thing with the help off Keys.

403
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,590
First let me coming.

404
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,250
This Ah,

405
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,610
working with the world user name and password.

406
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,100
So if you want to work with key is very simple fasting These the syntax,

407
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:17,890
right?

408
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,780
Simply your host name,

409
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,310
user name and password were going to use key file name then port.

410
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,200
That is your wish.

411
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,900
If you want to use,

412
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,780
you can use it other ways.

413
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,740
You can also skip that.

414
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,760
No problem on one more thing.

415
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,290
What is this?

416
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,290
T from where you can get this team right?

417
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:47,340
See there so you can create your keys using message are you can extend your key then the

418
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,590
private key party Hard to mention in this fight.

419
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,560
I mean in your court a private If I lay me how to mention here,

420
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,150
let me do one day I'm going to do door message.

421
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,940
Oh,

422
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,170
let me No no files here.

423
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:05,400
Right.

424
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,710
Let me create some keys.

425
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,160
Ssh!

426
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,100
Ivan Ke Jin!

427
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,460
So I'm going to create my a such key values.

428
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm in key pates.

429
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,070
See that we help Private key and public.

430
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,230
First we had to share this.

431
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,410
Give with your Suppose you are remote server.

432
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,850
Let me share that with my remote server.

433
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,370
Ah,

434
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,360
What is that?

435
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,760
A morsel?

436
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:27,940
Right?

437
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:37,630
Be that may get it on.

438
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,290
Be clear here.

439
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,590
I'm sharing with easy to user.

440
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:58,260
Easy to use that I'm getting my key now is your to hyphen user.

441
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,590
Sorry.

442
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,710

Now what is your private key?

445
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,910
This is your private key in this part.

446
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:32,580
We help your private key simply right now this file we have to use in our court that's it.

447
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,550
So in guest by the for it Anyway,

448
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,550
you are having now possible list authentication.

449
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,250
You can use it,

450
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:45,040
but if you want to use key not just for your key filing partier completely.

451
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,760
If your keys there in the current location directly going right there were only key name.

452
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,890
That's it.

453
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,510
No,

454
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,260
Let me see it on granite.

455
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,970
Be clear now we're using user name one.

456
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,950
You are cryptographic key.

457
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,900
It's a safe private key,

458
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,270
right?

459
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,550
Now let me run and see that reserve.

460
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,260
What happened?

461
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,160
Authentication fail.

462
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,180
Oh,

463
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,450

Mean user.

465
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,950
That's not correct.

466
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,760
Yeah,

467
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,710
he was.

468
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,780
Her name is easy to use with easy to use are we extended our key,

469
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,250
right?

470
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,660
So be clear about user and your keys.

471
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,760
Yeah.

472
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,710
Now let me run this and see there is a That's it.

473
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,890
So,

474
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,070
guys,

475
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,370
this is the way how we can work with user name and password on how we can work with your

476
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,790
ssh keys using your partner Michael.

477
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,870
Okay,

478
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,570
I will share this key in the bill off this video just to go through that and just know we

479
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,300
work with the Lennox with Lennox.

480
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,550
Now My requirement is I want to work from my local server from my locals are as windows.

481
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,810
Let's say this is my windows are all right.

482
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:12,760
Now let me write a new court on my Windows server.

483
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,050
Save it.

484
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,880
Ah,

485
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,750
some key.

486
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:25,980
Some script name is working with the more line X from windows.

487
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,190
Don't be white on.

488
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,580
Before going to work with that,

489
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,460
you had to check it.

490
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,440
Be how message?

491
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,810
Yes,

492
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,580
on my windows.

493
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,950
I already installed message.

494
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,270
If it is that.

495
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,720
Okay,

496
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,440
If it is not there,

497
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,660
please install them first.

498
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,190
Right,

499
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,260
Then offer that.

500
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Let me take step by step.

501
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,870
We know we are already having.

502
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,920
First we need to install.

503
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,950
We need to install Para Michael.

504
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,590
Then we are very important in our court.

505
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,510
Then when he tired,

506
00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:01,080
we need to create a society client then on toe our policy buddy,

507
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,340

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,010
That's are no confirmation like that.

510
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,780
Right?

511
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,990
Then after that you need to connect with your server.

512
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:25,280
Soto candid with your server These listen backs as a such cannot your host name.

513
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,610
Maybe this is host new.

514
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,350

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,070
So what we are using we're using simply password.

520
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,660
Right?

521
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,070

557
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,450
and I excluder some comer with the user name on password.

558
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,460
Now,

559
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,190
if you want to walk with some keys Yes,

560
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,270
You can also generate your keys on your local server the same way how we work around line X

561
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,400
server in Lenox.

562
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,850
Over.

563
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,860
I generally some keys and I shared with my remorse harbor on I then use this.

564
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,300
Is this very the same way on windows?

565
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,570
Also,

566
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,790
you can gender your keys and you can work with your remote server from your locals.

567
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,710
Our house windows.

568
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,120
That's it.

569
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,860
Nice.

570
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,760
Not only this.

571
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,240
This is just a basic a way to exclude your commands on your remote server.

572
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,260
But while working with your remorse or words,

573
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,850
you'll get different exceptions.

574
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,910
I need to handle all off them.

575
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,860
So how to?

576
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,570
Honey will discuss in later videos on how to transfer files from your local server to

577
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,270
Windows service.

578
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,010
All those things were going to discussing.

579
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,760
Let our use Okay.

580
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,660
Okay.

581
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,000
Yeah.

582
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,250
OK,

583
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,520

584
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,950
