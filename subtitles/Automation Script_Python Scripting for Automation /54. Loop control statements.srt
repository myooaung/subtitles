1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230
friends here.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,550
We're going to discuss about loop control statements.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,230
See,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,710
basically,

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,450
we hold two types off loops in your pipe on right there for Lupin.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,050
Well,

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,550
no,

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,500
we know that loops are going to repeat for a number of times based on your condition.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,730
Sometimes one time,

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,790
sometimes three times,

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,770
sometimes 100 times.

12
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,210
Sometimes even in different times,

13
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,270
You're going to repeat your la Z or you're going to eat.

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,930
Rate some n number of times.

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,940
Let's say very simple example.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,650
Suppose if I have a list,

17
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,610
uh,

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,550
consist off.

19
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,610
Let me take simply some four values.

20
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:47,450
Then it is going to repeat no four times and you're going to get numbers 01234 times.

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,420
So engine of these directly donate some list also.

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,750
Right?

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,150
That's it.

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,550
No large Madani.

25
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,330
Now you're going to repeat,

26
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,850
Are you're going to tolerate?

27
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,550
Are you are going to exclude this block?

28
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,380
How many?

29
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,250
Number of times?

30
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,560
12345 Because you have five.

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,230
I listen your list than your loop is going to repeat this block for five times are your

32
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,750
loop is going to treat this block for five times,

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,450
right?

34
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,450
That's fine.

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,850
But no,

36
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:31,640
we have some control statements for your loops means to control the nutrition part off your

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,150
lives.

38
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,940
They are like break Continue right.

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:44,800
Let me explain this year So what I'm doing is C let me go.

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,590
Simply one thing I'm reading very firstly itself.

41
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,940
Simply break no See the result?

42
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,250
You're not getting any old port.

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,000
The reason is faster.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,350
Fall break is useful to stop your impressions in your loop whenever break is in Kandahar,

45
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,280
right?

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,650
Simply or python will stop the loop apart.

47
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,440
So but this land is outside off your look Don't get confused.

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,320
Stopping the script is different.

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,820
Stopping the loop is different So we know if you remember somewhere we imported a model

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,620
cord ces And then if you remember,

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,420
sees dot Exit is going to stop your script study.

52
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,860
Let me say we don't only suppose I'm reading here.

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,150
Bring before exit,

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:40,150
then print after exit.

55
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,690
Then let me write one more line.

56
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,780
This is print off the luke.

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,670
No,

58
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,860
see,

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,130
that isn't you're getting before exit only That means you're Skippy is excluding only upto

60
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,390
this in total.

61
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,910
And we have sister exit because off that you're going to stop your entire python script be

62
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,350
clear.

63
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,150
Stopping script is different.

64
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,460
Stopping loop is different right now.

65
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,610
Let me comment.

66
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,560
Or anyway,

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,490
we don't want this right.

68
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:08,990
Let me.

69
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,350
They move all these lines,

70
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,860
not see the result.

71
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,880
Because off break what is happening?

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,680
Simply,

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,150
your loop is going to stop.

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,720
Actually,

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,450
where Loop has to repeat five times,

76
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,960
it has to treat four fighting's.

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,870
But because of break in the first situation itself,

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,450
your loop is going to stop.

79
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,120
But no loop is going to stop even your then.

80
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,660
At that time,

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,410
you're not going to exclude any number off lines in your Lou.

82
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,700
So because off this break you were flew off.

83
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,650
Exclusion part will come out from Luke thereafter.

84
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,470
Look what you have.

85
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,170
Apparently simply your printing.

86
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,820
Something offer.

87
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,000
Look,

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,310
that's what you are executing other ways.

89
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,650
Let me write the break off for Prince statement.

90
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,950
No,

91
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,410
See the result getting three.

92
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,560
Why?

93
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,650
Before break You help parentage.

94
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,110
So at least for festival your printing offer printing your first value are after excluding

95
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,290
your first situation.

96
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,650
You have immediately break.

97
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,470
We know you have a break.

98
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,440
Actually,

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,180
if you don't help break what will happen you're fighting will take this four value and then

100
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,090
we'll print that will decrepit six and it will print it will take 700 will print there were

101
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,350
decayed and we'll print.

102
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,100
That means dance.

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,850
You drink for certain number off times,

104
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,360
but because off break you are fluff control.

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,390
Instead of going for next value,

106
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,410
it is coming out from your loop.

107
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:36,850
That's it.

108
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,550
That is the uses off break.

109
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,820
Suppose my intention ease first,

110
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,590
let me print all your values.

111
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,370
Gotta get tingly whenever.

112
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,930
If I get 56 number,

113
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,110
then I don't want to print the remaining numbers,

114
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,630
but no.

115
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,350
But if I get a number called 56 while printing your values offer the numbers,

116
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,270
offer the numbers.

117
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,770
What do you have?

118
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,780
78 means it has to eat red for two more times,

119
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,950
but I don't want it rate,

120
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,310
but nobody for my number is equals to.

121
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,080
If my number is equals to 56 are that time after that?

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,930
I don't want to exclude my look.

123
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,990
Then simply use break.

124
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,170
No.

125
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,310
See,

126
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,160
there is a after getting 56.

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,090
You are not getting seven and eight because you are stopping your loop whenever if you get

128
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,850
number as 56 That's it,

129
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,250
right?

130
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes.

131
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,460
Ah,

132
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,950
June Day.

133
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,350
You're going to get some thousands off parts list list off parts you have in your hand

134
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,000
somewhere in some part somewhere in some part you have.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
You require part once.

136
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,320
If you are able to find your require part that I don't want to exclude the remaining it

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,350
rations for my No,

138
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:58,930
let me simply take in this way so that it will be very clear this Assume that I am writing

139
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,110
a simple fight on tiptoe.

140
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,820
Identify all the parts are now June.

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,450
But I gotta be all the parts on my host.

142
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,100
Right?

143
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:15,940
Let me day Suppose he was there being then user been hedged.

144
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,630
City beauty,

145
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:23,910
some something Some home users,

146
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,550
some X rated user somewhere blows IQ some conflict or XML Something like that,

147
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,650
right?

148
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,750
No,

149
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,370
I need to find out the part in which my head CD Pretty is there.

150
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,450
That is my intention.

151
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:46,650
Then suppose foster fall to take one by one part for each part in your parts.

152
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,800
Then I can print it simply in this way.

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,150
My each part I can print,

154
00:06:51,150 --> 00:07:01,670
but I want to bring the part which consist off extra dpt right.

155
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:08,430
See that if if Hexter DPS their heads to DPD,

156
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,050
if it is there in your part,

157
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,090
then I am printing it's brandy.

158
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,350
But your loop is not stopping.

159
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,110
It is taking somewhere second generation in the second inauguration.

160
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,790
Your condition is satisfied.

161
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,760
Then you're printing anyway because this is for Lou.

162
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,790
It is going to take next to Park on.

163
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,170
It is checking anyway.

164
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,520
In this,

165
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,920
it is not their extra deeply.

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,270
That's why you're not getting in on port.

167
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,020
But still,

168
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,250
your python is trying to take remaining integration values remaining values from your list

169
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,250
.

170
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,200
But my indention ease once.

171
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,450
If I get my path,

172
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm in the pot,

173
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,560
which consist off extra de pretty.

174
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,850
Then I don't want to you today remaining for remaining parts.

175
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,890
I don't want to exclude my look for remaining part simply,

176
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,150
I want to stop because I got my required part.

177
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,350
Why should a hatred for remaining parts?

178
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,580
Why should I waste?

179
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,000
And I said to my execution time.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,690
That's why what I'm doing is simply I'm stopping like,

181
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,530
see if I don't use break just for your understanding,

182
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,250
I'm writing Brink.

183
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,660
No working on.

184
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,650
I'm bringing each part.

185
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,920
See the result working on foster part Anyway.

186
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,290
Listen,

187
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,710
it's city,

188
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,470
but is not there.

189
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,010
That's why you are not printing your part now.

190
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,330
Working on user be next year.

191
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,680
But in this extra DPD is there.

192
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,750
That's why you're printing that.

193
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,080
So now you've got the require part.

194
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,940
Why should we go on?

195
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,000
Take next part I don't want to get.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,230
But your fighting is taking.

197
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,410
No,

198
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,230
because it is a loop.

199
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,850
It is going to take all the parts.

200
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,790
I mean,

201
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,250
whatever the list of Alice you hope.

202
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,480
But now my requirement is once.

203
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,970
If I get my required apart,

204
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,740
then I want to stop forcefully.

205
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,310
My loop.

206
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,840
Yes.

207
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,350
You can stop it in this way that you don't see that once.

208
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,750
If you print your each part,

209
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,380
then you're stopping right now.

210
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,070
Let me write something outside.

211
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,950
Off your Lou Old trade off for Luke.

212
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,760
No,

213
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,810
You're getting ordered off for Lou Plane offer printing.

214
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,320
You're actually,

215
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,450
but immediately it is stopping because break is there.

216
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,450
When are break ins and contour?

217
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,550
Simply Your look will stop.

218
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,170
Not only were for Luke,

219
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,220
even it will work even forever while loop as well.

220
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,550
Let me take simple example in my loop.

221
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:32,400
Suppose I'm going in this way while true.

222
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,750
You know this is the infinity,

223
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,050
Lou,

224
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,960
right?

225
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,850
So initially,

226
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,350
I'm taking some Cone County close to one.

227
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,550
Fine.

228
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm printing my count after count.

229
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,350
I'm increasing my co owned by complice one.

230
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,660
Yes,

231
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,850
You're going to get in vin numbers.

232
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:57,750
But my indigenous in guess if I get if I bring the number I mean up 200.

233
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,800
Once I reached 100 then I want to stop my way,

234
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,080
Luke.

235
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,550
Then what I'm doing is if your company's equals 200 stop your will.

236
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,580
That's it.

237
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,150
Break.

238
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,350
See that?

239
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,550
Once 100 is reach,

240
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,310
you're going to stop forcefully.

241
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,950
You're Luke.

242
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,850
Stopping loop is nothing but stopping the next year.

243
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,100
Relations you are stopping engine off going for next.

244
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,510
Recent?

245
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:23,840
Simply.

246
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,450
What's stopping you?

247
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:24,740
Allude.

248
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,110
That's it.

249
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,950
So that is the use case off your simply I mean about the break.

250
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,400
No,

251
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,590
let me go with Continue.

252
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,040
So try to understand,

253
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,450
Canoe.

254
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,730
It is somewhat confusion,

255
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,010
but in it understand it Anyway,

256
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,140
while going forward will use this continue on break in different scenarios so that it will

257
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,650
be good.

258
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,700
But at least for time being,

259
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,650
just try to understand What is the logic behind in your continue?

260
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,040
See,

261
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:02,950
Suppose what I'm doing is let me take arrange off 10 numbers,

262
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,250
then I'm bringing all the numbers.

263
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,590
First of one?

264
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,380
Yes.

265
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,250
You're getting from 1 to 9.

266
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,250
Right,

267
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,490
Joe?

268
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:12,820
Tonight.

269
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,400
But I want to get suppose 1 to 10 but nobody can take anything.

270
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,150
Let me take 1 to 11 so that you're going to get stop was 1 to 10.

271
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,000
No,

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,750
I want to print the numbers 1 to 10 except the seven number.

273
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,550
Then I can write in this your first awful If number is whatever the number.

274
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,190
If that is not equals to seven,

275
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,050
then I am printing.

276
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,550
That's fine.

277
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,450
This is one way,

278
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,550
right?

279
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,600
Your logic Right now you're not getting your number seven right?

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,330
One more ways,

281
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:53,810
Foster,

282
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,050
for simply am writing print printing your number,

283
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,650
then let's be clear.

284
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,750
I'm going toe.

285
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,420
Ah,

286
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,970
right.

287
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,650
Your print each outside off your if condition.

288
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,780
See that renting your number.

289
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,950
Printing your number.

290
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,990
Right?

291
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,470
First of all,

292
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,090
your printed statement these old side off your if condition now into off this line simply I

293
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,400
am writing Continue if number recourse to seven.

294
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,530
I'm reading.

295
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,640
Simply continue.

296
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,000
No see,

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
the results were not getting seven.

298
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,490
No off course.

299
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,180
Your previous logic is perfectly Garrett.

300
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,330
If number is I mean,

301
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,570
if each is not equal to sound,

302
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,750
that only printed that is correct.

303
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,850
But at the same time,

304
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,050
you can also write your logic in this way.

305
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,570
What will happen if you write?

306
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,600
Continue keyword,

307
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,170
See,

308
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,310
whenever continue is excluding by your python.

309
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,100
Then in that situation,

310
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:06,460
the remaining logic whatever you how in your block that is going to simply skip not only

311
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,000
this line,

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,410
even if you have some 100 lines here offer continue.

313
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,950
See here also here itself.

314
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,500
I have a continue African new.

315
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,450
Suppose this is the line inside off you were.

316
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,770
If condition off the continue keyword,

317
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:30,950
see the result know that you are not more where you're getting that line.

318
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,550
The reason is let me take this.

319
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,210
See after continue in your work.

320
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,740
If for Lupul Block even if you are some thousands off lines,

321
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,600
all are going to skip now You're fightin will go for next year.

322
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,350
Duration.

323
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,360
It's actually it is going to repeat for 10 times,

324
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,650
right?

325
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,350
1 to 11 means 10 numbers you're going to get once you are number is equals to seven.

326
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,700
If it is not ecosystem.

327
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,670
When you're not excluding,

328
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,650
continue then simply or printing.

329
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,000
But if it is equals to seven,

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,920
what'll happen continues exuding whenever continues excluding the remaining lines.

331
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,240
Ritchie,

332
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,900
how in your block they are going to simply mosque.

333
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,300
They're going to skip that for time being.

334
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,870
Guys don't worry much about your continue keyword simply as you in that when our can new

335
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,700
line is excluding by your python then that remain lanes which are their offer community

336
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,950
word they are going to skip.

337
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,210
So while writing some real time scripts,

338
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,440
you will get multiple situations there.

339
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,190
You will understand that why we need this Continue keyword upto that yard.

340
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,240
Oh,

341
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,750
wait.

342
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,450
But I'm being just a gym that can Who is going to skip the remaining lines in that

343
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,050
situation?

344
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:52,550
They okay this tour de you are Luke Contra statements.

345
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,120
I mean break and can you apart from that,

346
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,350
you are also having simply pass key words are pass a statement.

347
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,610
What is this?

348
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,070
Not only for your loops,

349
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,310
it is also helpful for your functions classes and then,

350
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,940
if condition first,

351
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,930
let me write something called If then print Okay,

352
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,050
Mostly the result.

353
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,680
That is fine.

354
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,950
Right?

355
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,120
But what I'm being is I'm going this line.

356
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,470
If true,

357
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,070
am rating.

358
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,330
Now you're getting another.

359
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,480
The reason is you know that whenever you feel have a condition,

360
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,510
you should have some block inside off.

361
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:31,950
That right,

362
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,350
at least one lane.

363
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,140
But for timing,

364
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,150
I don't want right anything.

365
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,270
Of course.

366
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,830
I don't know what how to write as off.

367
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,050
No,

368
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,110
but I don't want to get another then simply right.

369
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,650
Pass.

370
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,700
It won't do anything simply,

371
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,450
it will a wide aren't we simply make a one block,

372
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,410
but it won't do anything.

373
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:51,850
That's it.

374
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,750
The same day.

375
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,980
Let me take some.

376
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,050
Simply look for each in.

377
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,450
Simply range off anything you can take,

378
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,590
right?

379
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,850
No,

380
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm burning.

381
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,750
You're getting another.

382
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,160
Because for Lou,

383
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,750
right,

384
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,660
Blue means it has to treat certain number off Time's supper number off.

385
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,570
Times of some court R block are some set off statements.

386
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,560
But we don't know anything.

387
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,950
No,

388
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,710
that's why it is giving another so as off.

389
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,210
No,

390
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,550
I don't know what I have to write,

391
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,340
but I need a loop here just to await another.

392
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,150
You can use your vascular.

393
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,050
That's it.

394
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,700
I Oh,

395
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,100
yes.

396
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,450
Thank you for watching this for you.

397
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,310
These south mainly guys mainly need to understand about break and continue.

398
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,150
Right?

399
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,380
Anyway,

400
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,390
break is clear,

401
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,990
but maybe some people will.

402
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,650
How confusion on can you?

403
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,560
But you will get clarify while going forward.

404
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
Right?

405
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,060
Okay,

406
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,390
bye.
