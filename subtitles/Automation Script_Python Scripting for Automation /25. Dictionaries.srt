1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930
friends in this video we're going to discuss about big study data.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,510
Structure off.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,970
Fight on.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,080
Right.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,040
Let me weapon my editor.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,530
So yet I'm going to define your dictionary.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,380
Call for dick.

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,510
Stories are represented with curly braces.

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,050
Right.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,900
Are you?

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,150
Then,

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,190
let's say bring my big study.

13
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,170
And then I am also printing type off.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,250
You're given variable structure,

15
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,160
so you're going to see output,

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,660
either Deck study.

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,520
That means whatever you define with curly braces,

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,300
that is a big study.

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,150
That's fine.

20
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,810
Mexican.

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,150
Let me convert that into bullion.

22
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,900
You know,

23
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,450
it is a empty dictionary,

24
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,810
right?

25
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,830
I'm gonna putting that into bullion.

26
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,580
So you know any empty If you convert that into bullion,

27
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,490
it is always false.

28
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,880
That's what we're getting here already.

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
We know this rule as well.

30
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,150
Right?

31
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,600
Know what I'm doing is I'm going to come.

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,670
And this now I'm going to define addict study with some data.

33
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,330
So,

34
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,540
guys,

35
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,050
whenever it if you want to write a dictionary with some data,

36
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,950
you're to write like a key on its value paved.

37
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,990
I mean,

38
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,280
let's say I'm going to write.

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,550
This is as key on this as value.

40
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,370
Yeah,

41
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,950
anything.

42
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,730
This is a key on the value.

43
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,160
Suppose let's say bar I can take on one more thing is whenever.

44
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,240
If you're writing either Keilar value.

45
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,450
If that is a string,

46
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,250
you how to write in quotations?

47
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,810
Don't forget No.

48
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,200
Suppose I'm feeling that one is,

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,720
Mikey,

50
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,360
but I want to take that as a number.

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,050
Then I can write one badly on its value.

52
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,210
Let's say two is a key,

53
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,660
and its value is number two.

54
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,340
Yes,

55
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,750
all are valid ones.

56
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,590
So but the thing is,

57
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,990
I know.

58
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,540
But if you're defined your dictionary,

59
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,800
it should be like a key on its value paid representation.

60
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,160
That means So this is one item.

61
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,670
Actually,

62
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,500
in this item,

63
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,180
this is a key,

64
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,150
and it is a value.

65
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,590
So this is a key value,

66
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,150
Peter presentation say McKee and its value.

67
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,150
So keep a loopy representation.

68
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,260
Key and value.

69
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,610
Keep a representation key on its value.

70
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,250
Key value paid representation.

71
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,550
Right.

72
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,110
Fine.

73
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:28,850
Know how you can access how you gonna access the value from your dictionary.

74
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,460
So actually value start if you have there.

75
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,800
This is a value.

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,780
This is a value.

77
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,430
This is a value.

78
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,580
This is a value on.

79
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,350
This is a key that is a key.

80
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,690
This is a key.

81
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,810
There is also key.

82
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,220
So all these are keys on all these are values,

83
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,150
right?

84
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,810
So if you want to access any value from your dictionary,

85
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,400
it is always possible with your key only.

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,460
Let me print that.

87
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,150
My dictionary dot Let me do this food.

88
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,080
There is a key inside off your dictionary fruit.

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,470
Now I want to print the value for that fruit.

90
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,850
Tea?

91
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,540
Yes,

92
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:05,840
Apple.

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,210
You're getting right.

94
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,580
So you can also use one most intact that is called my dictionary dot Get Let's say I'm

95
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,600
going to take animal off course.

96
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,870
You can take anything now See,

97
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,950
that would put what you're getting.

98
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,740
Yes,

99
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,420
you are getting No,

100
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,230
let me come.

101
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,210
And all these things.

102
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:31,010
I'm going to bring my dictionary.

103
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,370
Something like dictionary called.

104
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm in key call.

105
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,050
Let's say three.

106
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,970
Do you have a key?

107
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,650
No dictionary?

108
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,110
No.

109
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,030
But if I try to access in this way,

110
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,530
see the output It is giving another key.

111
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,060
ETA three key three.

112
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,080
It is not there actually,

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,180
that we're getting this error.

114
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,420
But in June of this Intacs,

115
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,570
if I follow brain my dexterity dog,

116
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,890
get three.

117
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,450
I don't know what the trees there are not what I'm trying to get in this way.

118
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,780
See the difference?

119
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,480
We've been previous syntax on distant tax.

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,010
This index was giving now in giving none internal Giving another that way is the best one

121
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,570
to get.

122
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,850
Any time you are key.

123
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,150
But if you want to rise another of the time you can go and take this one.

124
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,850
So both of us are used to access.

125
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,450
You were values based on keys.

126
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,660
No,

127
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,250
Let me print your dictionary first.

128
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:44,330
I So if you want to see how many operations are in one of the different operations are

129
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,430
dated with your dictionary.

130
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,680
We have a sharp Kurt.

131
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,110
Let's say they find some dignity and see the air off.

132
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,580
Yet these all are the operations.

133
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,250
So already we have seen get operation,

134
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,280
right?

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,700
Let me do one thing.

136
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,030
My dictionary dot clear on offer this operation I'm trying to print my dictionary.

137
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,960
So before and after that operation I am printing see Clear Single.

138
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,260
It is removing all Kiva Lupe representation from your dictionary.

139
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,150
That's it.

140
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,950
Thank you.

141
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,150
That is OK.

142
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,810
Yeah.

143
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,050
Actually you are accessing a value based on keys right now.

144
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:35,220
What I'm doing is I want to I'll sign a new key value paid representation.

145
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,050
I want to add a new key value pair representation for my dictionary like,

146
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,750
let's say I want to take kiosks three right and its value as something like that.

147
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,480
Three.

148
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,650
No,

149
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,420
after these,

150
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,650
just observe your dictionary.

151
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,150
Now you're getting this one No.

152
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,950
Three key value three.

153
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:06,850
So this is the key value paid presentation on your adding with help off the syntax or

154
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,050
simply there is a way to add a new value based Don't key your dictionary.

155
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,430
But while doing in this way by mistake,

156
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,350
you are taking No,

157
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,690
I'm taking three.

158
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,540
But I don't know whether keys there on my desk study are not.

159
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,370
But I am trying to do in this way no,

160
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,860
see the output first inches off number three you're getting for physics.

161
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,740
The reason is,

162
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,610
while are signing a key value based on key in this way,

163
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,330
if he already there,

164
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,450
then value will be updated.

165
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,200
If that is not present in a given dick story,

166
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,980
the new key value paid representation will be creator not see before excluding 16th step.

167
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,930
You know there is no key value pair called three and number three that way,

168
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,480
because off 16th line,

169
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,030
you're ableto are on in 17th line.

170
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,020
We're seeing that new key value pair representation is added to your dictionary.

171
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,850
No,

172
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:12,250
What I'm doing is I'm trying to modify my existing key value.

173
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,480
So while doing in this way,

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,010
if he is not that it will do.

175
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,150
It will give a new key value pair representation.

176
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,600
He follow the keys there.

177
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,940
The old valley will be modified.

178
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,150
So be careful while doing while assigning a value to your key.

179
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,850
Right?

180
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,050
Fine.

181
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,350
No.

182
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,450
Let me commend all these things.

183
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,910
So this is your dictionary you're getting?

184
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,600
Know what I'm doing is bringing might be study,

185
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,030
not kiss,

186
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,710
not kiss it.

187
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,850
Will you list off kiss?

188
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:57,450
Ecstatic use You're getting No Samer.

189
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,380
You have one more operation called not values.

190
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,020
See that?

191
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,850
Put what you're getting.

192
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,620
You're getting only values right now.

193
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,660
You have something called items operation.

194
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:17,070
Let me take that brain.

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,400
You're dictionary door items.

196
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,570
See,

197
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:33,790
that would worry or getting You're getting a key and value as one item to that night.

198
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,840
So then already we have seen Yeah,

199
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,390
copy Will see.

200
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,200
Forced to copy then.

201
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,550
Yeah,

202
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,250
so nothing is there.

203
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,210
Why?

204
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,850
Because too my dick story not copy.

205
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,150
Let's it,

206
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,900
then print white,

207
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,450
right?

208
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,940
And you know what is the purpose?

209
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,110
Off?

210
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,800
Copyright.

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,340
Let me bring your I d off.

212
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,850
Why?

213
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,750
And then idea off my dick Study.

214
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,550
See the output.

215
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,830
So I These are different means whenever If you do copy right,

216
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,800
a new memory location will be assigned to your variable wife,

217
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,460
but directly,

218
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,880
if you are sign Why?

219
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,740
Because of my dick story The same memory address will be reference or even for way.

220
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,150
Also,

221
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,440
Oliver discussed this while working with your list.

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,750
Right?

223
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,470
So,

224
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,680
again,

225
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,300
this is a big story on this is my dig story a variable called my study on someone memory

226
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,420
addresses there on DC's representing with your my dictionary.

227
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,970
If I straightforward,

228
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,810
if I do what you cost to my dictionary,

229
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,150
what will happen Way is also going to reference referee Same memory,

230
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,710
others.

231
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,580
But I don't want to do in that.

232
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,630
I want to create a new memory location and I want to copy this data to here and I want to

233
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,620
ascend this memory location toe.

234
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,300
Why then at that time,

235
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,350
you had to be used dot copy operation?

236
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,550
Not so Okay,

237
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,590
so fine.

238
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,850
Now let me comment all these lines once again.

239
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:15,250
Then what is the next operation?

240
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Get?

241
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,050
He's done,

242
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,050
right?

243
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,170
Yeah.

244
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,130
We will go with form keys Clear than corporate on.

245
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,420
Get items done.

246
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,050
He's done.

247
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,920
Are you go with the first.

248
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,040
Ah pop in pop item.

249
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,600
I don't go with object.

250
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,760
Update is nothing back If you have already some external light let's say you have this dick

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,550
study and I'm having one more exotic called new Dick story.

252
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:52,800
It was too something called four value for Of course,

253
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,950
you can take number four.

254
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,460
Also string.

255
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,990
No problem,

256
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,250
right?

257
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,720
No.

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,660
What I want raise this key value paid.

259
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,060
I want to add into my old dictionary.

260
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,130
Then you're dodo,

261
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,250
Your old dictionary dot update with your new dictionary.

262
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,510
That's it.

263
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,750
So after this,

264
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,520
just try toe print your dictionary and see the result like nooky valley paid added to your

265
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,300
old dictionary.

266
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,930
So update is for that purpose.

267
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,560
If you want to go at one big story to other dictionary,

268
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,370
then you had to use update operation on your dictionaries.

269
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,560
Your world victory not update.

270
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,180
Then what is the data you want to upgrade your world history.

271
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,050
That dictionary.

272
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,950
Fine.

273
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,850
Then let me go with Pop.

274
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,310
See?

275
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,040
Ah,

276
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,780
OK.

277
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,840
So guys has have no What is the latest victory supposed?

278
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,370
This is the only distinction,

279
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:48,560
Ali.

280
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,230
I let me come and deal somewhere.

281
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,450
You are horrendous treatment.

282
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,310
No.

283
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,110
See your latest.

284
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,650
Traditionally,

285
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,150
is there something like this?

286
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,050
Right.

287
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:06,740
Know what I'm doing is I'm being simply dictionary dot pop operation on offer that I'm

288
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,550
trying to print.

289
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,650
What is my dictionary?

290
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,040
See,

291
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,750
that would put something wrong.

292
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,470
Oh,

293
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,750
sorry.

294
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,760
I didn't destroy the key,

295
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,000
right?

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,260
Yeah.

297
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,650
I had to provide a key.

298
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,350
Let's take e call four.

299
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:35,540
See that poppy is used to remove a key value paid representation based on key.

300
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,030
We're giving only key.

301
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,850
It is removing your Kiva Lupe representation from your dictionary.

302
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,480
There is one more thing called pop item,

303
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,250
right?

304
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,220
Let me run this thing.

305
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,250
Unseat output my dick.

306
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:51,750
Snotty,

307
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,850
dark Bob.

308
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,580
I don't on our after that.

309
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,050
I'm trying to print my dictionary.

310
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,320
See that?

311
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,660
But what you're getting right,

312
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,600
it is removing some diva loopy representation.

313
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,850
I said it will remove randomly.

314
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,790
Maybe lost value somewhere middle or something.

315
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,360
Whatever.

316
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,760
It may be right on you can assign this item What?

317
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:26,930
You are removing so removed re mode item and finally print the word you are removing with

318
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,580
help off.

319
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,050
They were pop item.

320
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,250
You can see that.

321
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,690
See,

322
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,480
this is what you are removing with help off pop item soap opera and actually the most

323
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,790
randomly That's it.

324
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,450
Okay,

325
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,960
now we didn't put Bytom Then we have form keys and,

326
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,300
uh,

327
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,510
Saturday Fort Let me go with the from keys,

328
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,250
okay?

329
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,470
Nothing is there.

330
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,900
Guys,

331
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,710
let me come and all those things.

332
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:05,720
Let's say ah,

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
how some key school?

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,050
Yeah,

335
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,700
he I Well,

336
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,110
you like I'm thinking as a list off kiss list off kiss.

337
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,990
Okay.

338
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,950
Now I want to create a dictionary which consists off this case,

339
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,950
right?

340
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,050
The new dictionary equals two victory door from keys.

341
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,050
Just do your kiss.

342
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:43,440
Now it is going to create a new dictionary with the key Sozzi a Were you under the output

343
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,240
value sermon?

344
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,330
Because we as if I don't have any values now you cannot date whatever that key believe you

345
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,480
on dot that you can update.

346
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,950
Let's say I want to update new dictionary with the key Corley A I want to assign letter

347
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,210
forced later.

348
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,270
First all for big.

349
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,350
Something like that.

350
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,780
So after that,

351
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,510
it just a print.

352
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,460
And see your dictionary.

353
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,770
So nothing is their gaze from keys are used to created big study.

354
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,620
Created the study with it required keys.

355
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,190
That right?

356
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,230
Fine,

357
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,470
No.

358
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,750
Let me go with the last one.

359
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,590
That is such a default.

360
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,610
Nothing.

361
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,890
Is there days as off?

362
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,250
No.

363
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,050
Let me take some dictionary called empty Dictionary.

364
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,260
Night.

365
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:48,710
Know what I'm doing is I'm trying to look for some key.

366
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,790
If the key is there,

367
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,250
okay?

368
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,350
And whatever the value I'm having that I will use that if that he is not there.

369
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,020
See,

370
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,420
some was I don't know whether keys there are not if keys,

371
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,180
they're used that value itself.

372
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,890
If it is not,

373
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,780
there are bread with the new value.

374
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,450
I mean,

375
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,650
first up during this output,

376
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,250
then you can understand.

377
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,990
So settle default.

378
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,690
I'm setting for number K value 45.

379
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,200
Sorry for key K value 45.

380
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,540
No,

381
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,350
After this,

382
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,140
let me create a dictionary with,

383
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,890
uh any any.

384
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,250
Okay.

385
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,100
Know what I'm doing is again I'm running my dictionary dot settled the fold.

386
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,460
If already keys there,

387
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,870
then it won't disturb.

388
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,440
If he is not there,

389
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,450
then it will update with suppose a new value.

390
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,460
No seed output.

391
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,300
No,

392
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,600
it won't.

393
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,590
Money for you are value apple because already fruit is their food keys.

394
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,710
There in your dictionary with the value call apple.

395
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,440
No,

396
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
the purpose Officer deformities.

397
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,730
If this key is already not there.

398
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,800
If it is not there in your dictionary,

399
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,550
then only will take a default value.

400
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,870
If it is already there,

401
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,200
whatever the value is there that will only it will consider just nothing.

402
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,760
But you know,

403
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,670
you're trying to add a new key.

404
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,810
You don't know the keys.

405
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,450
There are not.

406
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,110
If he is there,

407
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,970
don't disturb if he is not there.

408
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,760
Then said this value for that key.

409
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,550
That's it.

410
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,350
So that is the user separately for it.

411
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,050
Okay,

412
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,850
so this These are the operations on your dick stories.

413
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,160
The final important point these days.

414
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,970
Previously,

415
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,280
that dictionary is on order.

416
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,450
The collection off dictionary.

417
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,530
I mean,

418
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,030
before three,

419
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,540
not seven.

420
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,420
Washington now in 3.7 Western dictionaries ordered collection.

421
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,740
That means the way how you are defining same order.

422
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,870
You will get it right.

423
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,360
See?

Suppose.

425
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,510
Let's say this is your dictionary Let me go with your common line.

426
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:07,440
Let me copy that can pasted.

427
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,690
So if you print your dictionary you're getting in the same order the way how you define Let

428
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:25,010
me go with my fight onto So my pipe onto is there somewhere by Tuanku on Let me define my

429
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:32,870
dictionary here on Let me bring the or dictionary See,

430
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:39,620
Father has been changing No actually we have started starting keys fruit But you are

431
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,750
getting in output one So in previous Washington's before three or seven you were a big

432
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:53,710
story Waas on ordered the collection off later but in $3.7 You were dictionaries ordered

433
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,860
They don't Okay,

434
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,450
