00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
prince we know they're fighting is having a lot off models right on here.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.150
I'm goingto take one off the model as platform model.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.150
Then what is the use off this platform module?

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.000
See,

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.530
Platform model is useful to access under laying platforms data such as hardware or burning

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.870
system on integrated washing in four.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.360
And here.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.710
You No need to worry how to get this information.

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.190
I mean,

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.550
platform is a model,

11
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.150
right?

12
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.790
See,

13
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.200
by simply typing from your command line because you are initial stage,

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.620
right?

15
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.320
What you will do,

16
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.550
you'll go toe fight on,

17
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.030
then simply there.

18
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.970
You'll tape support.

19
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.400
Simply helped models on.

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.550
You're going to get list off models here?

21
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.190
Yes,

22
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.920
I June dirt from the list off models.

23
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.450
You're going to select anyone off there.

24
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.750
Then how you will come to know where is the uses of that model?

25
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.780
Right.

26
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.950
You will see in the documentation itself.

27
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.850
What is The use is off that model night.

28
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.230
You have a lot of models here.

29
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.480
Just as you know you're going to select one off the model called C a sweet or one of the

30
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.750
model called at medic.

31
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.450
Get bus,

32
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.970
then what is the uses of their It is there with your Piketon documentation itself.

33
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.950
I will show you that.

34
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.550
Just wait,

35
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.000
Right.

36
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.450
Fine.

37
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.680
No guys.

38
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.750
Already we have seen,

39
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.930
if you want to use any model in your current stripped right,

40
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.150
what we're doing simply we are importing that,

41
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.140
right?

42
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.920
So how to use anymore?

43
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.640
Doolin Escape.

44
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.470
So in our case platform,

45
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.050
right.

46
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.950
See,

47
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.940
you can use simply import platform.

48
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.780
This is one way.

49
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.430
And already we have seen you can also import import platform as pity.

50
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.200
That means you are Ali using your model or you are renaming your model in giraffe using

51
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.280
platform as platform.

52
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.950
Now you're using as pity,

53
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.690
right?

54
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.910
Yes.

55
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.180
It is possible you can modify their default model name in you in your current state,

56
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.650
not with your python bike.

57
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.230
Or they also one more way right from platform.

58
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.350
You can import all functions and variables.

59
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.470
Okay,

60
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.600
so you know,

61
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.080
model is nothing,

62
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.040
but it is a simply by transcript,

63
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.850
which consist off some functions classes on variables.

64
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.850
So all directly getting bored in this way,

65
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.910
then suppose from platform model.

66
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.990
I need only system on platform functions.

67
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.950
So instead of this,

68
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.040
we have different things.

69
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.500
Just arguing that I know support system and platform or required from your platform under.

70
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.810
Then I can import only those two things in this way.

71
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.900
Also right.

72
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.100
So as a fresh air,

73
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.490
right?

74
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.010
You are a beginner level.

75
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.950
Then tried to use first in this way.

76
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.620
Well,

77
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.270
going forward,

78
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.220
we will see this one.

79
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.000
This one This one.

80
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.850
Everything we will see,

81
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.950
Right?

82
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.260
Fine then Just know we discussed that platform.

83
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.590
Is it a model?

84
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.210
Which country stops on functions and variables then how you can list all those things faced

85
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.080
with your bite on?

86
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.380
There is a default function called D a r.

87
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.230
With that,

88
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.910
you can list all the functions and variables which are there with your platform module not

89
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.180
only with your platform model,

90
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.250
with any model right.

91
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.870
Then you can use simply from scrip.

92
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.250
You can print it the air platform or from common land directly.

93
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.550
You can run the A R platform.

94
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.460
I will tell you about the procedure.

95
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.630
It's on.

96
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.470
Then how you can get a documentation for you were black for model not only platform any

97
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.960
model,

98
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.470
right?

99
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.890
Simply you can run Help a platform from your common line or from script.

100
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.250
You can run print help platform,

101
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.350
Right?

102
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.540
Let me woman first.

103
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.320
Your common line.

104
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.970
Right?

105
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.500
So that is just a junior.

106
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.490
I want to work with platform module.

107
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.580
Then what?

108
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.360
How to do for sitting it?

109
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.580
Maybe come online or it may be your by transcript Your imported first.

110
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.950
So I'm going to import it.

111
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.370
Import platform?

112
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.930
Yes.

113
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.180
Just know you imported platform,

114
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.540
then immediately.

115
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.310
My action is I want to know what are all the operations are What are all the functions and

116
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.450
variables are dead with your platform.

117
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.980
Then simply run B a r platform.

118
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.550
You'll get a lot of things here.

119
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.950
Each and every thing is some separate operation.

120
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.250
Probably gonna zoom each and everything is like a one operation.

121
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.500
Right?

122
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.850
But you don't know what is the purpose of each and every thing Here We have a lot of values

123
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.600
as a list.

124
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.160
Right?

125
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.950
See that?

126
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.720
How many well is you?

127
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.150
How you can find out using length off your list.

128
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.180
72 operations are red.

129
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.950
Suppose right there is a specific operation with each and every value.

130
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.120
Which is there in your list Off running the air.

131
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.760
Your platform?

132
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.050
You're getting different things through.

133
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.500
So a year for each and every thing they disperse.

134
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.450
Speak operation.

135
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.780
But how you will come to know what is The use is off this each and everything.

136
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.950
Right?

137
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.090
So this you are intial stage what you're to do immediately.

138
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.550
Immediately after importing your platform,

139
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.200
you list all available operations or simply functions and variables.

140
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.750
You are running the air Your platform module,

141
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.300
then Same way.

142
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.150
Just a help plateful and it is going to give a document.

143
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.980
Right?

144
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.190
See that this model prices reduce as much platform identifying data That means some

145
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.650
hardware information right into a trailer into information.

146
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.450
Something like that.

147
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.620
Now if you go with all the functions this has have No,

148
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.780
this model isn't giving her with the class concept.

149
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.350
I mean oops,

150
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.760
concert.

151
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.480
But you don't worry.

152
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.860
As of now,

153
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.950
we don't know jobs right?

154
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.170
Finally will come to know how to create a model with hopes are we?

155
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.150
The only functions are with only wearables for timing.

156
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.850
Don't worry about class,

157
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.250
right?

158
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.650
So somewhere Just go down,

159
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.370
guys.

160
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.410
Not only with this model,

161
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.030
any model as off.

162
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.270
No,

163
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.810
don't after these classes.

164
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.250
Okay,

165
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:19.470
Just to go down Gordon see year for us to go down completely from taco down Now you're

166
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.140
getting some very of functions functions not Try to understand this 11 paper there is a

167
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.570
architecture function from your platform.

168
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.850
Then what is the uses of that?

169
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.200
It is going to give some architecture information just to go to document one by one so that

170
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.750
he will get I see mission nor black form.

171
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.500
Right?

172
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.210
You lot off things here just to go to that one by one.

173
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.750
What is the python washing you have on your holes?

174
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:55.550
Your platform model will fetch that Like then what is the operating system type?

175
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.250
See that system?

176
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.950
That's it.

177
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.850
NATO,

178
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.140
as I've noted,

179
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.650
guys don't know nothing is that it is displaying now.

180
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.710
You don't worry about this.

181
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.910
Well,

182
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.390
you as off?

183
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.550
No,

184
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.460
actually is a simple single variable like from your mathematic function.

185
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.580
P A is a by value,

186
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.870
right?

187
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.460
Same bend.

188
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.610
Onal is one variable.

189
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.150
That's it,

190
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.350
like see?

191
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.620
Same way you can run your entire thing from your script as well.

192
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.660
Let me do it.

193
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.450
The script.

194
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:42.230
So my requirement is walking with more news dot The way fine.

195
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.850
I want to work with platform,

196
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.130
aren't you?

197
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.640
Then what?

198
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.680
I will do I need to import first.

199
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.810
Import black form right there immediately.

200
00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.550
I want to see list off operations or list off functions and variables with your platform.

201
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.390
So from common land directly running the air off platform.

202
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.760
But if it is a script,

203
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.550
your toe print that then only it will show you on your output.

204
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.650
Let me save it.

205
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.210
And in your sublime takes to run your pythons,

206
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.640
give just to press control ble b control,

207
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.630
Beefy press.

208
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.250
You will get the list off all oppressions.

209
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.260
I mean,

210
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.740
control bees just to run your pipe.

211
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.010
Answer.

212
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.640
Same way.

213
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.360
I need to know that documentation as well,

214
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.650
right?

215
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.630
Simply print help off your platform.

216
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.170
That's it.

217
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.550
Run it and see the output.

218
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.000
So it is giving us your time.

219
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.050
Your entire document,

220
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.050
right?

221
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.420
You can say copy and 17 toe.

222
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.140
Some fight on.

223
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.650
We can go through that line by line.

224
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.610
Right?

225
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.170
But batteries always.

226
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:46.420
Guys,

227
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.790
If you want to get any help,

228
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.450
try to use only commonly.

229
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.270
So always tried to write a court invite landscape and from common land.

230
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.350
Try to get your help.

231
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.110
Night.

232
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.150
Fine.

233
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:03.550
So let me go with some one by one Operations but not all some of them which are very,

234
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.370
very important.

235
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.430
But we're going forward.

236
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.250
I will cover the most of the operations which are required for our real time cases.

237
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.590
Right.

238
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.290
Fine.

239
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.220
Let me No,

240
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:13.650
this one.

241
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.550
Right.

242
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:22.650
So this I want to know what type off opening system you're using Then for that in platform

243
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:22.650
,

244
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.850
there is a function called See that in our system.

245
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.600
Run the script,

246
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.140
concede out windows.

247
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.340
So now I can see that I can write back.

248
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:42.650
I can write like this is that may do f string.

249
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.950
This is so this is the operation less?

250
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.240
You can write in a hard writing.

251
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.390
Carl embraces boy.

252
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:51.850
Yes.

253
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.670
When those ways that's not Sit out.

254
00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:00.650
But because off platform right system you're getting information as windows.

255
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.090
Same script.

256
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.650
If you run on UNIX like systems,

257
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.650
you will get that operating system name right?

258
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.290
Then let me take one more thing.

259
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.150
I want to see What is the fight on Washington's there on this host,

260
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.950
right?

261
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:23.110
See that brain by Don West Chinese?

262
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.450
Let me run from your platform,

263
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.550
right?

264
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:32.050
So they say here you may get confused.

265
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.390
Why we are using parentis is write something wrong?

266
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:37.750
Yeah,

267
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.850
after calibrates yard right quotation.

268
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.150
Fine.

269
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.510
You may get some confusion,

270
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.610
so yet I'm using parentheses.

271
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.370
And in this parentis is I'm not writing anything.

272
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.550
Sometimes you heard right sometimes No need to write.

273
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.640
You should not,

274
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:55.840
right?

275
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.250
Actually,

276
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.830
I see this is a function.

277
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.100
That's why I'm writing appearances.

278
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.440
But how you will come to know whether that is a function or not again.

279
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.330
In your documentation,

280
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.310
you'll have that See that system with appearances on here in documentation they are not

281
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.180
writing anything means no need to.

282
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.940
Probably anywhere you will using this system function other ways,

283
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.400
other ways you can do one more thing simply run platform.

284
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.620
There is a model right from the time using system.

285
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.710
I don't know system is a variable or a function,

286
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.150
then simply will run in this way.

287
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.850
Then see that it is worrying that function then Now just include parentis is because you

288
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.840
are in jail stays.

289
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.290
You have to do all these steps,

290
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.300
right?

291
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.850
Fine,

292
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.550
No,

293
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.510
You can also get your pipe and Washington in terms.

294
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.710
There are some different values for their days.

295
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.500
Like okay,

296
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.500
you can also get your fight on Washington in terms off couple No see that if I run there,

297
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.850
how I'm going to get simply I'm running break simply.

298
00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.160
I'm going to use this.

299
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.250
So this is also your function.

300
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.150
So I'm going to do platform,

301
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.800
not see the last or put you're getting as a couple,

302
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.820
right?

303
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.530
Major minor on released washings,

304
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:13.750
right?

305
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.250
That's it.

306
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.580
So here we're getting out.

307
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.020
A string on body area are getting as a couple inside a double again.

308
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.190
You're dead eyes a string only.

309
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:30.350
See that quotations are there like then let me go on run are somewhere examples from your

310
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.650
black form.

311
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.680
So what I want raise.

312
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.430
So now I can run directly from your terminal.

313
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.110
That's better.

314
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:43.350
Let me clear my screen first.

315
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.640
So I'm wondering in tow Python,

316
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.750
I'm going to import platform.

317
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.860
Let me simply print So you can do this,

318
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.450
even even know our script also days.

319
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.510
But I am badly.

320
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.600
I want to show you the result directly.

321
00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.750
That's why I'm running here.

322
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.000
So I want to know what is the mission information?

323
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.870
See that I am the 64 like same.

324
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.420
You just run on your next like system.

325
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:10.700
Also,

326
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.300
you will get some your UNIX like systems from 86 by 64.

327
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.150
Something like that.

328
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.130
Right.

329
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.200
Then what is the release window?

330
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.100
Spend right.

331
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.720
Then see that there is a platform dot platform module.

332
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.320
I'm in function through which you're going to get entire information,

333
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.850
Your windows operating system and on its sp pack something like that.

334
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.880
Right.

335
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.670
Then I want to see the architecture.

336
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.360
Yes,

337
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360
You No need to worry.

338
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:43.550
What?

339
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.000
How?

340
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.850
You can select your dysfunction names from your model.

341
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.300
You know this one?

342
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.530
Done this.

343
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:57.650
See the operations now I want to print our picture off this operating system.

344
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.040
So simply platform dart.

345
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.120
That is something operation called Architecture.

346
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:11.350
You can such here somewhere we thought underscores from where we help.

347
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.290
Yeah,

348
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.190
somewhere here.

349
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:21.230
How architecture like that's it to that 64 bit windows.

350
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.480
Be right.

351
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.400
Then what is the process that you are using?

352
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.950
Some very help Process that object that like just copy.

353
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.290
That's it.

354
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.490
Fine.

355
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.170
No.

356
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:46.710
Finally let me go with the You were platform not no.

357
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.100
What is the node for this?

358
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.320
So here?

359
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.070
Because this is my desktop.

360
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.680
I'm getting this as my no,

361
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.290
right.

362
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.530
We just try to run this on UNIX like systems.

363
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.770
You are just after that.

364
00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:57.650
What you're going to get?

365
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.350
Yes,

366
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.450
you're not information,

367
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.550
right?

368
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.270
Then that melon lost one.

369
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:03.850
Here,

370
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.830
