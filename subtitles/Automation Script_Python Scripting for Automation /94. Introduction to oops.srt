1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
friends here are concept please.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,790
Introduction toe.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,350
Oops.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,370
See,

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,310
Basically Piketon is supporting for both procedural and object Winter programming concepts

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,310
.

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,670
Suppose if you implement any court in terms off functions then we can say that we are

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,030
falling Procedural Were injured Programming concept on We already done this in our previous

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,610
who use.

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,450
Now here our concentration is on Oops.

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,000
Then what is on hopes or what is an object oriented programming concert?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,960
So it is all about uses off class observed inheritance polymorphism data obstruction on

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,170
data encapsulation See suppose if you're new to programming or hopes concert then you will

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,830
get confused about all these times Nobody you know where to remember.

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,550
All these things will go with the best up so that it will get idea on each and every time

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,650
or on each and every concert in your hopes.

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,340
But for time being,

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,860
just remember that Oh,

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,050
please All about uses off class and object.

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,030
That's it.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,840
Simply hopes is the combination of classes on objects.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,280
That's it on the very first important point in your hopes.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,650
Concert,

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,210
please.

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,650
We are using hopes concepto create an object Then what is an object?

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,670
See?

27
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,090
Object Could be anything which exist in real time like human fan core,

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,290
mobile laptop,

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,850
most keyboard or any application.

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,100
Ah Jenkins,

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,310
Vlasic Tomcat,

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,250
Apache on Docker.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,050
Anything on docker parts?

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,100
Anything you can take as an object.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,260
The only thing is,

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,150
if you take anything as an object,

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,830
it should exist in real time.

38
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,550
That's it.

39
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,610
And if you go with any object,

40
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,430
eat off.

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,910
It has some characteristics and functions.

42
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,340
Let's say human or person as an object.

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,930
Then we can say that characteristics are like name is hide.

44
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,300
Color on functions are like walking,

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,800
talking on running right,

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,430
not only human you can take.

47
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,140
Suppose a party as an object support.

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,570
If I take a party as an object than I can say,

49
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,490
character sticks off about your like abortion configuration file off party.

50
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,700
But is that really pretty dot com on functions?

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,490
I can say,

52
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,050
I suppose you know about He is usedto so some static bridges that I can plead as a function

53
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,050
.

54
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,730
But don't worry.

55
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,860
You don't need to remember about characteristics and functions.

56
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,790
My default.

57
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,980
Why lighting your core?

58
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,010
You will come to know what you are to take a character sticks and what you have to write a

59
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,450
function.

60
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,010
Nothing is there.

61
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,590
Actually,

62
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,880
characteristics are like attributes are variables and functions,

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,360
you know,

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
to implement some logic.

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,900
We're using functions.

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,450
That's it.

67
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,910
But I don't remember.

68
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,550
Even this characteristic can functions for your object.

69
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,740
So here you have to remember that object is something which exist in real time.

70
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,050
That's it,

71
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,410
right?

72
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,070
So why We are using hopes.

73
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,560
The first thing is we are using Oops,

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,550
concepto create an absurd Then why we need to create an object.

75
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,150
What is the purpose?

76
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,780
They let me give you the very first point That is very,

77
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,410
very useful.

78
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,950
That is the group related functions.

79
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,040
The group related functions.

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,150
Why we need to group the little functions.

81
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,050
I think you an example.

82
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,110
Just as you know that you are having to applications in your court.

83
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,550
I mean,

84
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,150
let's say you're having somewhere publication.

85
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,950
So anyway,

86
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,610
of obligation,

87
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:44,810
you're having to APS let up one on the and in your core for up one you define 100 functions

88
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,760
just for logic,

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,150
implement on for up to also you implement their 100 functions.

90
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,150
So this is for apple one and this is these are four upto so totally we're having 200

91
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,850
functions.

92
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,580
Totally.

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,650
We're having 200 functions.

94
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,150
Just observe their in my logic.

95
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,330
Somewhere I am calling up to I put to you have to function then how your python is going to

96
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,720
exclude.

97
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,230
Actually,

98
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,230
whenever if I call this function up,

99
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,210
we have to function.

100
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,650
Then it has to call.

101
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,550
So the Abdul let's 100 function inapt So I want to call 100 function.

102
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,450
Then your partner has to call this last function.

103
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,750
But how your python is going to exclude that how it is going toe pick this function

104
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,070
whenever if we call in this way So that's what I'm saying is let me right here so that he

105
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,240
will get some idea See,

106
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm having Tuapse in my court Then I am implementing AP one function one like waste I'm

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,100
implementing 100 functions for my app One apple,

108
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:03,560
one 100 functions the same Be how up to functions in my court Let's a function one for up

109
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:12,410
to like ways I defined up to yes 100 function 100 function So finally how many functions?

110
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,790
I'm having 200 functions in my court,

111
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:21,450
so I'm having 200 functions in my core earn somewhere in my court.

112
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,750
I'm calling up to 100 function.

113
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,150
Just I'm calling somewhere in my court this function then how your python is going to

114
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,750
exclude that.

115
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,910
So actually you're having he had 100 functions on here 100 functions so totally you're

116
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,830
having 200 functions in your core.

117
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,390
Big,

118
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,750
clear.

119
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,160
So when nobody if I call dysfunction,

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,270
how your python is going to execute are actually whenever if I call this function you have

121
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,460
to exclude this But how you're fighting is going to exclude It will take this function name

122
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,940
and we'll come back with very first function anywhere.

123
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,860
There is no match.

124
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,240
That's right.

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,860
We'll skip that So first check is filed Then we'll check with second function failed Check

126
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,600
with Likewise,

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,540
it will check 200 chicks in 200 check There is a map.

128
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,280
That's why it is going to explode This function now simply We exclude this function your

129
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,450
bite unease doing 200 chicks,

130
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,860
right?

131
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,470
So instead of that what I am doing his Let me go in this way I am defining these 100

132
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,150
functions for up one.

133
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,150
I'm giving some name Call up one under that I'm defining under functions.

134
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,300
Let's say for up to also I'm defending the name call up to I mean,

135
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm creating two separate blocks in up one block I'm having under functions and in upto I'm

136
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,690
having 100 functions right now.

137
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,490
Let me remove this Just assumption,

138
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:51,870
Grace.

139
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,950
So that really good idea.

140
00:06:52,950 --> 00:07:03,840
Now I am calling Apple 200 function Then how your python is going to exclude previously to

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:12,750
exclude this airport to function after 200 function you're fightin done 200 ticks right now

142
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,800
How it is going to check whenever If you have a block concept in your court under block I'm

143
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,100
defending 100 functions here.

144
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,280
Under this block,

145
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,750
I define 100 functions,

146
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,950
so I never If you have a block concept here how your pie Tony's going to exclude your

147
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,400
function so fast you will take the first apart.

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,850
What is that up to with up to it will check here and what this check is for.

149
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,680
That's why it will skip all these functions Boutique So then it is coming to hear up to Yes

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:42,680
,

151
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,270
there is a map with up to upto Now you're fighting I will try to exclude your function by

152
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,050
comparing in this block so that you are skipping.

153
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,350
Suppose 100 checks here,

154
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,880
Right?

155
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,540
So previously you're having 200 checks to exclude your function.

156
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,780
But now we're having only one,

157
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,950
not two ticks.

158
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:09,880
So one tiki's combating the up to with the block one that is fail one check,

159
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,460
then upto that is success.

160
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,050
Second check,

161
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,120
then to exclude your way of 100 function in block two.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,080
We need 100 chicks anyway.

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,770
Come back to your previous procedure.

164
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,300
Now we reduce 98 ticks that isn't wanted for his right spirit is high.

165
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Come back to that now.

166
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,370
Writing your core in terms off a block is called simply abs like that.

167
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,050
Writing your court in terms off block is called an object.

168
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,200
But anyway,

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,160
this is not perfect.

170
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,690
I will give that diddle structure So no,

171
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,040
you you got to know that oops is useful group related functions so that you are going to

172
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,790
save some time while excluding your core.

173
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,850
Then second thing is to create a template or blueprint.

174
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,050
What is this?

175
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,150
We know generally what is midway template?

176
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,860
Just a junior.

177
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,160
There is some industry right on.

178
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,650
It is going to give some findings.

179
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,100
Just a gender.

180
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,150
There are four members.

181
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,350
They are interested to giant in this instruct for some courses.

182
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,680
Right?

183
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,530
But what these four members are ready to join,

184
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,950
then this institute,

185
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:28,750
will you Some forms toe collect the data about this information about these four students.

186
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,780
So what they will do?

187
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,550
Let's say this is rent one,

188
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,550
Sorrento and store and three thence to rent for.

189
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,000
Then they will give you a form.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,900
For this.

191
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,040
They are going to give one form first round,

192
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,050
172 rounds two and three,

193
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,530
then store.

194
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,560
And for then Sorrento,

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,200
one will fill the data here,

196
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,310
throwing to fill a data.

197
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,450
Here's two and three Philadelphia here to run for from the data here.

198
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,970
But if you observe here actually they're having one word.

199
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,650
Your template.

200
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,850
They're having one marginal template.

201
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,650
So from this template there taking a direct scope your printout on that printer they're

202
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,250
sharing so that the work is easy for this insurance.

203
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,530
No,

204
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,390
student Vince,

205
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,700
rent one from their data like name is address untested course so intemperate.

206
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,510
If you are like fill the name here,

207
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,750
then age here,

208
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,550
then suppose address than industrial courses.

209
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,040
Yes,

210
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,550
I assume that there are pretty different temperate is there.

211
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm giving this tempter to each and every one so that I can get the date off.

212
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,650
These four students very easily.

213
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,660
Suppose you figure empty,

214
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,540
empty form.

215
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,640
Then the injured guy has to tell.

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,950
Please fill Your name is rolling something like address on industrial courses.

217
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,450
But instead of that,

218
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,560
if the injured guy has some template,

219
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,250
then it is very easy to collect the data aboard students.

220
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,150
Right.

221
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,320
So now that template is called simply Brugge blueprint.

222
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,870
So from their template,

223
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,340
we are getting the information about your students.

224
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,040
Not only this four story and suppose tomorrow 400 members are ready to join.

225
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,760
Then what these guys will do,

226
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,510
the insured guy will go simply.

227
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,310
They will take 100 printouts off the template,

228
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,550
whatever they're having on this 100 templates,

229
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,820
they're going to distribute for each and everyone so that they can collect the information

230
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,550
about hundreds friends very easily.

231
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,440
Right now,

232
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,730
in our hopes,

233
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,060
concept template is nothing.

234
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,460
But a class template is nothing but a class from the template.

235
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,720
You can create any number off objects from that template.

236
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,910
You can create any number off objects very easily.

237
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,380
Right now,

238
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,920
I will explain this with a simple example so that you can get idea on hopes concert.

239
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,600
Just wait.

240
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,220
And one more thing.

241
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,770
Finally,

242
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,520
you can say that Oops is a concert where character sticks and functions off.

243
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,450
Real life object is packaged as a single entity in the court.

244
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,320
Just know we have seen previously,

245
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,650
right?

246
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,650
I mean,

247
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:21,180
the group little functions were giving some name for functions are simply we are grouping

248
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,650
our functions under one name so that there isn't one days.

249
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:26,830
Well,

250
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,950
excluding your core,

251
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,150
right?

252
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,170
See,

253
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,500
just assume that let me given name us.

254
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm in script name,

255
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,390
working with hopes,

256
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,950
not people.

257
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,740
Just as you know,

258
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,770
gays just agenda on my host.

259
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,860
There are two parties are running may be any number of our budgets,

260
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,490
No problem.

261
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,050
But initially just dogo toe Give some idea.

262
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,350
I am assuming that on my server that our to our party start running.

263
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,220
Just simply assume that so if to our bodies are our name.

264
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,650
If you want implement a court you know to clear two objects.

265
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:13,220
So if you observe if you previously we have seen right how we're creating objects from

266
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,050
template from template.

267
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,150
See that?

268
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,630
So there's anybody if you're writing a court in terms off,

269
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,020
Oops!

270
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,750
On one more thing.

271
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,680
Basically,

272
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,030
this oops concept is very,

273
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,230
very important for application development or up development side for automation side.

274
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,050
You can write your court without roots concept also.

275
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,280
But if you go with hopes concert,

276
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,080
then you can invite your court.

277
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,710
I mean efecto Corrigan,

278
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,950
right?

279
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,870
Right,

280
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,350
fine.

281
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,560
So that's what I am saying is just agenda on the words are were to a party.

282
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,040
Sarun.

283
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,010
Let's say Tomcat,

284
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,170
anything you can take.

285
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,710
Let's I'm taking in this way in my core to Tom gets are running right.

286
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,750
See how I'm going to implement my court.

287
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,920
So I suppose if you're surgeries ah,

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,610
you next box and then I can say being piped on.

289
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,690
Then I can start my court in this way,

290
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:04,950
right?

291
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,200
You know what is the use is off this underscoring the school name.

292
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,590
Underscore Underscore May right then definition means Let's see.

293
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,640
No,

294
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,050
let's say Ah how suppose Tomcat seven.

295
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,870
Somewhere in my location whom let's say,

296
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:34,250
some automation user under that we help Tomcat seven in their their do you how some corn

297
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,810
for directory under 30.

298
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,590
How some sorrow dot xml fight So why I am taking several XML means if you go with Tom,

299
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,090
get the main conflagration.

300
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,900
Finally start xml the same way.

301
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:52,480
Just assume that I'm having one more time Got on my server night those same values,

302
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,020
but accept seven.

303
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,750
This is nine.

304
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,450
So that is well going forward.

305
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,780
We can also write it.

306
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,150
Well,

307
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,060
we'll also write a court automatically to identify how many Tomcats are running on your

308
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,570
host,

309
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,560
but for timing.

310
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,900
I'm taking to Tom Cares just I'm assuming on my server too.

311
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,110
Damn.

312
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,800
Got some funding.

313
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,350
That's fine.

314
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,430
No,

315
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,830
actually,

316
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,350
my intention is how'd radiologic I had to write a logic just to display?

317
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,950
Don't get configuration file on Tomcat home.

318
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,750
So already how taken Tomcat conflagration Fairly disease.

319
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,230
Okay,

320
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:39,080
on if you know about Tom Care disease called Simply Tomcat whom Only after this part we can

321
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,460
say that is a tomcat home.

322
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,100
Because under this,

323
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,630
we're having every files.

324
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:42,990
I mean,

325
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,850
the files which are later for your tomcat.

326
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,620
So for Tomcat seven,

327
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,280
this is the home for time.

328
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,690
Get nine.

329
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,350
This is the home.

330
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,110
Now my requirement is simply I need to display Tomcat.

331
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,430
Seven conflict files Tomcat nine conflict file on Tomcat.

332
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,100
Seven home,

333
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,350
Tom,

334
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,840
Get nine.

335
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,150
Home,

336
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,390
right?

337
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,530
That it liken display.

338
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,610
But I want to implement this court first in terms off functions.

339
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,520
Then I will try to convert in terms off.

340
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:07,960
Oops,

341
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,850
or you'll get idea.

342
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,910
Okay,

343
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,950
so just wait.

344
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:18,600
So what I'm doing is Tomcat 70 deals other ways.

345
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,030
What?

346
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,750
I will lease.

347
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:28,130
Get the details for each Domke each Tom care.

348
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,230
Let me pause.

349
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,650
Tomcat seven here.

350
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,070
The same way.

351
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,200
I need to get details for H.

352
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,860
Tomcat.

353
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,950
Tomcat online.

354
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,810
Nazi.

355
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,880
Right.

356
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,720
So finally,

357
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,160
I am doing return?

358
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,850
None?

359
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,820
No.

360
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,150
Here I am reading a function,

361
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,450
So I need a waste model.

362
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:46,720
Here,

363
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,640
let me import that.

364
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,320
So after that,

365
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,340
what I'm doing is I'm defending a function called Get guys.

366
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,020
Let me right.

367
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:00,610
That might take function.

368
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,410
Name on whatever you're passing,

369
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,640
that is configuration file.

370
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,650
So that is like Celebrex and Milan.

371
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:09,990
Dickens,

372
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,250
however,

373
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,160
underscore XML.

374
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,720
That's fine.

375
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,970
So know what I'm doing this first off,

376
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,550
all I'm finding Oh,

377
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,240
Tomcat Conflagration file variable.

378
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,190
It is nothing but directly.

379
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,680
Ghana's you,

380
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,740
your several xml,

381
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,660
then I'm finding Tomcat home.

382
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,420
It is nothing,

383
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,200
but where's dot part Gordillo?

384
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,950
Your name off your Sarwar XML file.

385
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,190
But if I do this operation,

386
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,310
you're going to get up to con.

387
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,050
But I end up put Tomcat seven.

388
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,410
If you come back to levels back in configuration file,

389
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,330
then you're going to get Tom,

390
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:44,850
get home.

391
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,790
So I need to play one more time ways dot Part door dear.

392
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,630
Your name already?

393
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,660
We've done this in our previous videos.

394
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,550
That's it.

395
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,200
Right on here.

396
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,310
If you want to display your information directly,

397
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,950
can display.

398
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:10,310
So I am writing the Tomcat config file is so simply here I am writing TCF off.

399
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,700
Tom,

400
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,350
Get conflagration five on and then I need to display Tomcat home as well.

401
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,660
Right?

402
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,160
So the Tomcat home is so here I am displaying Tomcat home.

403
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,230
That's it.

404
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,980
So finally,

405
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,950
I'm returning with the non value.

406
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,970
That's it.

407
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,260
Let me run the score.

408
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,660
What happened?

409
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Norte Beauty A our name directory name.

410
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,590
My important right.

411
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:47,260
Empty pot.

412
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,460
Where is their data?

413
00:18:51,460 --> 00:19:04,150
That's fine ways dot pop dirty your name ways not Paul.

414
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,260
Dirty air name.

415
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:14,660
Um,

416
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:24,760
what happened here?

417
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,620
Let me under into my bite on import ways.

418
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:35,950
The a r way's not what dot Let me write and see the options.

419
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,790
It is there?

420
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,050
No,

421
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,200
the i r name and a spelling mistake.

422
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,770
No ways.

423
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,950
Not part dot The name Saudi.

424
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,450
He s ballistic.

425
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,260
That's fine.

426
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,580
No,

427
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,610
See the result you're getting that would put for your first tomcat.

428
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm in Tomcat seven and Tom got nine.

429
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,600
But here,

430
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,490
if you observe in the same function,

431
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,980
I am finding my conflagration file on Tomcat home on also,

432
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,660
I'm displaying.

433
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,160
But I want to display the information using other function.

434
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,970
Then what?

435
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:21,450
I am doing his then I am writing display details.

436
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,950
That's it.

437
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,320
Okay,

438
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,800
Now,

439
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,830
if I run this anywhere you're not calling,

440
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,660
let me call that.

441
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,550
So after getting details for Tomcat seven,

442
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm trying to display the details for that.

443
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,560
So simply did display ladles on bomb,

444
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,070
Got seven display details.

445
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,220
But if I run this,

446
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,240
you're going to get an error.

447
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,200
That is TCF is not defined.

448
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,990
So you know in your functions concert Be clear.

449
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,400
It is very,

450
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,730
very important in your normal functions.

451
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,150
Concert?

452
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,000
If we define any variable inside off one function,

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,210
then you cannot access that inside off other function.

454
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,350
The reason is when you nobody for different any variable by default that is local toe that

455
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,660
function now.

456
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,490
I want to access in this function than water.

457
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,450
How to do I need to make it does global.

458
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:18,080
You were two variables TCF i th I need to make it as a global.

459
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,060
Now I can able to get your values right.

460
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,950
That's fine.

461
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,350
What I am doing is I'm removing these two functions to display or details.

462
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,800
First I'm calling.

463
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,240
You are getting details for each Tomcat,

464
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,900
Tomcat seven and Tomcat nine.

465
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,330
So,

466
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,850
after this,

467
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,350
I am calling display details.

468
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,260
I'm calling to times.

469
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,730
What is the result?

470
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,920
You're going to get both the times you're going to get Tom get 90 days,

471
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,790
then very storm cut.

472
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,220
Seven.

473
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,450
So that is the problem with your normal functions concept.

474
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,550
See whenever if you call if you call.

475
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,320
You were get details for Tom.

476
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,350
Got seven.

477
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:09,050
Your coming here on your getting your variables call you call a variable called TCF one th

478
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,550
because often 17th lane,

479
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,210
you're going to exclude this function on offer eggs gush.

480
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,490
Excluding this function in your variable school TCF one pH you're having values for Tom.

481
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,090
Get seven.

482
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,800
That's fine.

483
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,050
Then immediately are calling Tomcat nine also.

484
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,600
Then whenever If you call.

485
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,510
Then you were coming the same functional.

486
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,360
You're going to overwrite or relight new values for your TCF.

487
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,160
One pitch,

488
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,550
right?

489
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,050
Then you were world values gone,

490
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,610
Tom.

491
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,980
Get sound information gone then to capture your tomcat.

492
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,160
Seven details before calling Tomcat nine.

493
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,920
You want to return your Tomcat?

494
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,420
70 deals with help off for return TCF one pH on that values we cannot sign into some least

495
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,530
are some variables here.

496
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,350
I mean,

497
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,220
let me write in this way.

498
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,350
So a really good idea.

499
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:10,550
So what I'm doing is our Tom Cat seven Tomcat seven configuration file on Tomcat seven.

500
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,330
Tom,

501
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,930
get home seven.

502
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,970
Who then?

503
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,770
I need written here.

504
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,050
Right.

505
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,350
DCF on and then teach.

506
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,050
But I don't want to do this thing.

507
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,760
I want to capture my values without returning in my court.

508
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,850
Then it is not possible with your normal functions concert.

509
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,160
Then it is possible with your hopes.

510
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,760
Concert state.

511
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,750
Let me write one more program with hoops concert for real.

512
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:48,350
Get now idea So with boobs Not be what?

513
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,760
Let's be clear.

514
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,030
Fussing anyway.

515
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,210
Let me and start in this way.

516
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:55,910
This is common.

517
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,660
Ah,

518
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,330
sorry.

519
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:09,370
Not that then I'm defining main function That's fine on inside off that.

520
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:09,950
First off,

521
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,660
while I'm taking configuration files off Tomcat seven and Tomcat Mine.

522
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,260
Okay,

523
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:23,050
Are you can also take name like the Tom Got seven configuration file.

524
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,720
I'm get nine con figuration Fight.

525
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,160
No problem.

526
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,100
Anywhere able.

527
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,420
Yes,

528
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,170
I have taken previously.

529
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,380
Tom,

530
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,560
get seven Tomcat nine,

531
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,330
But I'm taking down.

532
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,510
Gets seven cf on time.

533
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,660
Got nine cf Noble.

534
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,260
That's fine.

535
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,300
No,

536
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,730
let me write.

537
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,730
Simply return None.

538
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,620
So this is just like your functions now in this,

539
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,260
I want to include hopes concept.

540
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
So,

541
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,650
guys,

542
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,190
at the end of this explanation,

543
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,450
you will come to no the users off who's and one more thing whenever.

544
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,700
If you want to write Oops,

545
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,890
concept in your core.

546
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,260
First thing is you need to define a template.

547
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,190
So if you want to defend any template,

548
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,830
you ought to take a cue to call the class class.

549
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,890
So what is our concert on Tomcat were working?

550
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,450
Take any name for your template,

551
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,950
that's it.

552
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,550
And whenever you for defining a template name just to start your name with Capital letter,

553
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,090
that is an option.

554
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,280
But it's but it's good to start with capital letters.

555
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,660
That's it So that is basically into defending template before going to use hopes.

556
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,660
Concept in your court,

557
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,950
but in turn off calling it has a template.

558
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,720
Just call it as a class defending a class.

559
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,510
But in your mind,

560
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,070
just as in there,

561
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,660
defending a class is nothing but preparing some former preparing some template.

562
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,700
That's it.

563
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,230
Thank So now one more thing.

564
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:44,260
We know that creating temporary is nothing but grouping some related functions into that

565
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,830
the group really functions were using hopes.

566
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,050
Concept toe group related functions were creating templates.

567
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,850
The group really the functions were creating class.

568
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,290
So no,

569
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:56,970
basically,

570
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,010
in your previous scored,

571
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,870
what are the functions?

572
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,660
Unique Get details for each Tomcat.

573
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:10,950
And one more thing is let me take only functions names first one function Ease this one

574
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,410
right on second funnies.

575
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:19,450
Second function is this predators So be clear.

576
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,350
Now you're getting clarity on your oops,

577
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,760
that's fine.

578
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,520
So,

579
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,890
guys,

580
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,350
one more thing Whenever If you define any function inside off a class,

581
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,450
then you had to say that that is a matter,

582
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,290
not a function.

583
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:32,770
Of course,

584
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,450
both are same except one execute.

585
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:42,110
See why nobody for defining your function and you are class then your per se doesn't method

586
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,930
on the hard right one before it.

587
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:49,530
Argument at the very first always that has itself see anyone of previous score You are a

588
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,220
function is taking only one argument Here also is taking only one argument.

589
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,300
Forget about this body Hard to write it.

590
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,060
Why you will get clarity the same day Display function is not taking anything in your

591
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,560
previous school.

592
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:01,850
No.

593
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,670
Now he also it is not taking anything but hard.

594
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,400
Right self first right,

595
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,790
cell phone.

596
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,510
Forget about it.

597
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,680
I assume that there is no any extract.

598
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,660
You hear Cellphone self here and here.

599
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,850
That's it.

600
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,860
Ok,

601
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,270
but there is a purpose for self not only self ignite any Cuba as the first argument on the

602
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,380
order used that same argument in your core,

603
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,260
I can write simply my name.

604
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
But universally,

605
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,670
all are following self as the first argument by default.

606
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,350
Anyone metal off it glass?

607
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,210
That's fine.

608
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,350
No.

609
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,690
Would your previous court so no.

610
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,050
Here we don't bother about Global are like Okay,

611
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,550
so I need you to find a very first available called TC off.

612
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,760
Let me copy these two variables.

613
00:27:48,760 --> 00:28:01,400
So this is the normal function under normal function.

614
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,740
Generally,

615
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,220
we are defending variables in this way.

616
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,120
But whenever a few different variables inside or faith method always you have to write your

617
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,870
variable with cell for the heart.

618
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,960
TCF I mean,

619
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,350
you're required Variable sell for door bitch.

620
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,000
Why again?

621
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,290
You will come to know just away.

622
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,250
Okay.

623
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,520
See,

624
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,430
normally in your functions if you already find any variable your writing X equals to white

625
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:26,850
close to three.

626
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,570
Something like that.

627
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,690
But here just sergeant,

628
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:35,450
that engine operating x self dot Exe self dot way That's it like And finally rightly gunman

629
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,210
then display function.

630
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,320
So in this play details you're having this thing?

631
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,620
No.

632
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,350
Let me copy the same lines.

633
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:53,660
Let me arrange in traditions.

634
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,190
So I know.

635
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,100
But if you want to use your variables instead of methods always.

636
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,560
Yo,

637
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,760
you have self doubt that very hard right here.

638
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,450
Self door,

639
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,350
self door.

640
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,950
That's a okay,

641
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,120
that's fine.

642
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,390
No,

643
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,090
be clear.

644
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,160
Just know we created a template,

645
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,390
right?

646
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,080
Like injuries.

647
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,500
Having a template on Evan,

648
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,240
I worry for students are ready to take some courts from instruct introduced,

649
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,260
giving some template to each and every student.

650
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,370
So student is going to fill their data into that temple.

651
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,570
Now,

652
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,600
if you have done in our court,

653
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,830
we are two Tomcats.

654
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,850
I didn't that These two tomcats are like to students.

655
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,760
And this is like a form for instrument.

656
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,420
Now we need to pass this way to do the copy off this Tomcat template to Tomcat.

657
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,750
Seven as the last time.

658
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,220
Get nine.

659
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,240
That's right.

660
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,790
See that?

661
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,660
I'm going to create a objects.

662
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,550
I'm going to create objects,

663
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,850
even forget about your configuration files first.

664
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:01,170
So we're assuming that in Saudi on our sir,

665
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,260
where we're having two Tomcats.

666
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,960
That way we need to get to templates into your hand.

667
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,600
I mean,

668
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,340
if there are two Tomcats,

669
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,760
we need to clear two objects.

670
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,140
How to create jobs.

671
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,560
Very simple.

672
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,760
So we're having Tomcat seven.

673
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,620
Right on,

674
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:19,920
then.

675
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,620
Tomcat.

676
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:20,890
My,

677
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,440
therefore,

678
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,860
stick.

679
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,550
You're required Object names.

680
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,350
Tomcat seven equals two.

681
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,750
Nice to create an object.

682
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,590
What we have to do is we have to take a Xerox copy off template.

683
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,050
So what is our template?

684
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,050
This is our template.

685
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,780
So what is the name for Template?

686
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,530
Tomcat?

687
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,330
That's it.

688
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,360
Simply take here,

689
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,950
Tom care.

690
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,990
But he hard right,

691
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,810
But And this is here.

692
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,490
Then create object for Tom.

693
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,160
Get nine.

694
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,590
Um,

695
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,740
ca.

696
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,440
That's so same drugs.

697
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,710
Copy off this template we have given for Tomcat seven and Tom.

698
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,260
Get mine.

699
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,780
Tom,

700
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,220
get seven on Tomcat.

701
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,270
Name as off.

702
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,500
No,

703
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,570
just We are given drugs.

704
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,760
Copy to the students.

705
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,650
Now,

706
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,890
you've historians feels that data in the template.

707
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,450
Then we're having information about that student in that template.

708
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,750
Right?

709
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,870
So as off.

710
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,100
No,

711
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,400
we're not creating an object.

712
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,860
Simply.

713
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,660
We have given the template copy.

714
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,010
Toe,

715
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,560
toe object.

716
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,110
Tomcat.

717
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,420
Seven.

718
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,160
Time get nine.

719
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,970
No,

720
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,410
actually,

721
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,330
if you want to create an absurd unit toe,

722
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,300
fill the data field of data Means you're to call at least one method from your template.

723
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,700
If you want to call our limit of snowball,

724
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,150
at least you're to call one matter.

725
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,410
Then we can say that object has been created.

726
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,950
No,

727
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,370
Tomcat,

728
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,250
seven dot See,

729
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:36,530
guys,

730
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,550
if you want to call any matter inside off your object,

731
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,410
you need to use dark.

732
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,650
First thing.

733
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,390
Be clear.

734
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,720
This entire template is there in this tomcat seven on Tomcat mine.

735
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,450
Right?

736
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,080
So why Nobody feel working with tomcat.

737
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,390
Seven,

738
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,640
you have to assume that this entire thing is for Tomcat.

739
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,630
Someone and I know.

740
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,000
But if you're working with Tomcat nine then you have to assume that this entire thing is

741
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,600
for Tomcat.

742
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:00,880
Nine.

743
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,550
I'm sort of that.

744
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,450
I want to go get my for Tomcat.

745
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:07,940
Seven.

746
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,170
I need to get configuration file on Tomcat home.

747
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,760
Then what I ought to do is I need to call this function.

748
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,920
Met her.

749
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:24,750
Just a bite bossing this conflict because that is taking conflagration file,

750
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,050
right?

751
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,070
No.

752
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,950
Whenever if you call in this way,

753
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,920
fight on is going to convert internally.

754
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,680
This US Be clear.

755
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,350
Be clear.

756
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:44,180
Don't write this in your core.

757
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,040
You will get another,

758
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,770
but fighting will convert that internally in this week.

759
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,620
Tomcat seven.

760
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,450
That's it.

761
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,620
Let me enable it.

762
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,550
Actually used to not right.

763
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,690
So the same function.

764
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,950
This line this lane is going to convert into in this way.

765
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,390
So I know.

766
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,480
But if you can work in this way no,

767
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,120
you can assume when nobody feel calling this matter right?

768
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,760
What is the self value?

769
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,180
Self is nothing but no Tomcat.

770
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,950
Seven.

771
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,490
Now in the entire template.

772
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,850
Replays self with tomcat seven.

773
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,350
Know what you are doing,

774
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,180
Tom?

775
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,130
Get 7 30 c off off course.

776
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,050
That itself but selfish Tomcat seven.

777
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:30,720
So,

778
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,060
Tom,

779
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,290
get seven dot Easier.

780
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,840
So in memory somewhere your pipeline is creating Tom.

781
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:44,450
Get seven dot DCF on at the same time,

782
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,340
Tomcat seven dot de hitch No.

783
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,310
Two very was dynamically created for your Tomcat.

784
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,800
Seven.

785
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,370
The same day.

786
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,770
In case if he called Tom,

787
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,490
get mine for Tom,

788
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,040
get nine.

789
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,710
Also,

790
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,340
you are in memory somewhere because while calling from Palm,

791
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,750
get nine well calling.

792
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:12,960
Get details for each Tomcat from mine Self is becoming nine Tomcat nine.

793
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,130
That's why whenever,

794
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:19,000
if it is excluding this method for Tom card nine again dynamically,

795
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:29,250
two variables are created like tomcat mine dot DCF Tom cat nine dot t off some Get home.

796
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,620
Start Deitch Tom,

797
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,050
get home.

798
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,810
But if you're observing your court,

799
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,430
we're not having four variables were having only two variables.

800
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,960
But while running separately,

801
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,640
your four way tables are created.

802
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,160
Then how they're going to create just a rate first.

803
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,750
Let me right.

804
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,550
Let me call for Tomcat nine also.

805
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:00,670
So we're calling from Tomcat nine configuration file.

806
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,660
Is this one on the hard to call from Tomcat?

807
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:03,930
Me?

808
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,350
That's it.

809
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,350
Ok,

810
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,380
but once again,

811
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,090
whenever if you call any method from object internal You're fightin will convert in this

812
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,250
way.

813
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,750
So where you converting in this way by default?

814
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,180
Self,

815
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,690
self,

816
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,200
self key.

817
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:24,360
What is always pointing to from which object you're calling so that separated variables is

818
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,700
create operate Variables are going to create for each and every object.

819
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,160
Now there is no overlap.

820
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,510
So previously,

821
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,570
if you have done your normal functions Concert If you call this.

822
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,360
Get details for Tom Kurt.

823
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,930
Seven.

824
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,000
You're getting information in these two variables for Tomcat seven.

825
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,470
But if you call from Tom Kitt nine.

826
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,350
If you call from Tomcat nine.

827
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,010
Then you are variables are war right?

828
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,440
With Tomcat nine data.

829
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,660
Tom got 70 guys going toe daily.

830
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,550
But here,

831
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,630
that is not the case.

832
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,930
Whenever If you call from bomb,

833
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,550
get seven,

834
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,650
come get seven.

835
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,180
Variables are dynamically creating.

836
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,980
And whenever if you call from Tom,

837
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,700
can't find Tom.

838
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,840
Get nine variables are dynamically creating right,

839
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,600
Fine.

840
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,210
So,

841
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:09,460
guys.

842
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,920
And now we are saying that tomcat seven object has been created.

843
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,740
Tom got nine has been cleared somewhere in memory.

844
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,670
Right.

845
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,650
See that somewhere in memory?

846
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,920
Tom card.

847
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,220
I'm not writing full time.

848
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,150
Get Justin generating Tomcat seven on Baumgarten line.

849
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,880
So Tomcat,

850
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,690
seven door PCF variable Tom,

851
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,620
get $7.

852
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,340
Tom got home on Tom.

853
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,490
Get nine Doherty cf configuration file on Tomcat nine dot tomcat home.

854
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,190
So these variables our creator.

855
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,850
But these variables are there under this name.

856
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,520
So this is called an object.

857
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,590
Under this object,

858
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,340
these two variables are back,

859
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,190
right?

860
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,720
So if you want to get this variables always your toe get tomcat object.

861
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,220
So simply,

862
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,380
Tom Kurt Door Tomcat nine Doherty CF Tom got minder Th or time,

863
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,240
Get $7 TC of Tom Get seven or teach.

864
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,900
Right.

865
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,790
So here,

866
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,870
if you observe dynamically,

867
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,450
we're creating our variables,

868
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,740
right?

869
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
I'm see.

870
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,730
And one more thing.

871
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,340
Very important.

872
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,650
One.

873
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,900
If you want to access these variables in other function in normal function programming

874
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,560
concept,

875
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,840
what we are doing we're making are available to us global.

876
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,450
But in hopes concept,

877
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,950
you can access this variable inside off other function.

878
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:49,720
We thought making this as a global because these two matters we group on the Tomcat that

879
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,500
way One method variables you can access inside off.

880
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,130
Other matter.

881
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:54,580
Variable.

882
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,150
So here we are,

883
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,240
accusing one step making global.

884
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,120
We're not making global by default we can access one variable off one matter into other

885
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,600
variable.

886
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,270
That's why directly I heard himself dot UCL.

887
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,970
Right?

888
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,340
So,

889
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,710
guys,

890
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,920
now often executing these,

891
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,040
I mean from tomcat.

892
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,870
Seven This matter on Tomcat.

893
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:19,700
Nine this matter in memory somewhere we are creating four where it was two for tomcat seven

894
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,940
and two for tomcat nine.

895
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,240
Might be clear how they're going to create.

896
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:31,960
So simply one memory location for Tomcat seven and just you have to call this has object on

897
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,120
one memory location for Tomcat nine.

898
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,140
And this is on object.

899
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:40,240
And in this we how TCF variable and teach variable the same way here.

900
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,470
Also,

901
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:46,850
we hope TCF variable on Tomcat home variable if I want to get Tomcat hedge.

902
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,290
I'm Tom.

903
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,880
Got home,

904
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,550
Tom.

905
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,460
Get $7 th how to use.

906
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,140
See,

907
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,460
I'm not calling.

908
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,380
Display externally outside,

909
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,740
off your class inside off my main function.

910
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,150
My name.

911
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,880
But if you are in the inside off a class,

912
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,210
then only you ought to take self be clear whenever If you're inside off a class,

913
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,940
then only how to take self keyword.

914
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,830
But now what if you are in the outside off a class you have to take your object name.

915
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,200
Sort Tomcat.

916
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,930
Nine for Tom Kirkman.

917
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,020
We are two variables.

918
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,330
What are those two variables?

919
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,960
TCF one th But I want to destroy them.

920
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,530
Then Darty CF,

921
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:27,640
then print dot Th See the result.

922
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,440
Something wrong?

923
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:30,890
What is that?

924
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,740
Let me verify.

925
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,550
Ways is no different.

926
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,810
Yeah.

927
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,140
When it import that waste,

928
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,030
let me import ways.

929
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,590
Not on the output.

930
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,350
See the result?

931
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,070
You're getting drunker.

932
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:52,700
90 deals Now I can print randomly.

933
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,420
First I can print.

934
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,610
Tom got 90 cf.

935
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,940
Then Tom got seven Tomcat home.

936
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,760
And then at last,

937
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,530
I can print.

938
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,520
Ah,

939
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
bring to Tom Card seven.

940
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,030
Configuration file.

941
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,580
Yes,

942
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,830
you can access at any time.

943
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,530
Randomly,

944
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,720
you're required variables because somewhere in memory location,

945
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,320
they're going to create a new variables for each and every object.

946
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,070
They're not going to war.

947
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,320
Lap.

948
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,920
I'm get 90 separate member location.

949
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,130
Tomcat seven on 30.

950
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,280
Separate member location.

951
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,020
They So this is the way.

952
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,900
Hope how we can access you are variables outside of class,

953
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,520
but we already defined a function inside off your class to display your variables.

954
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,920
No,

955
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,930
I want to display for Tomcat seven configuration file on home.

956
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,460
Then I need to call this display details matter from your Tomcat.

957
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:42,980
Seven.

958
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,520
Let me call there Tomcat.

959
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,360
Seven dot despair details.

960
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Wanted to pass any arguments anyway by default.

961
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,170
Self is there,

962
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:52,400
right?

963
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,140
We need to pass self value generally.

964
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,540
But whenever the free run in this way by Tony's going to convert ever displayed details as

965
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,130
in this way,

966
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,320
Bram K seven.

967
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,470
That's it.

968
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,180
Because we're not having any arguments here.

969
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,350
Not this time.

970
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,580
Get Sonny's going to assign self on inside of this one.

971
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,960
We're having self door TCF means from We're calling from Tomcat seven.

972
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,350
Right?

973
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,180
That's why you are going to get Tom card 7 30 c f.

974
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,630
Bomb gets seven Doherty hitch.

975
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,970
Right.

976
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:23,550
See that?

977
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,590
I'm going to run.

978
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,210
See?

979
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,640
That is there.

980
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,430
You're getting Tom got 70 days?

981
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,340
No.

982
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,500
Let me call for time.

983
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,130
Get mine.

984
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,000
So when nobody if you're calling from butler object based on that,

985
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,820
your partner is going to get variables for that object.

986
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,930
See that?

987
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,390
And I can call any number of times first.

988
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,620
I'm going to call Tom.

989
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,320
Got $9 display D days.

990
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,230
See there.

991
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,820
So this is the odd one days with your hopes concert,

992
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,320
right?

993
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,440
So they one second.

994
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm re breeding the important points for oops Concept please.

995
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,390
First,

996
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,220
we're taking oops concept to create an object.

997
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,720
So in our program we get her to objects.

998
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,430
So what is that done is by creating two objects dynamically.

999
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:19,530
We're going to create a separate memory locations for you were required object so that we

1000
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,920
can access many any variable at any time.

1001
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,610
Right on.

1002
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:34,870
Basically who is nothing but grouping later functions for particular thing under one name

1003
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,370
that is called a temporary no indeed.

1004
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,860
What's way we are creating template to create an object under template.

1005
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:49,520
We are writing the little functions for that object Nazi Right on.

1006
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,150
One more thing.

1007
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,470
No Internet always self here You can write anything.

1008
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,520
Let's say I'm writing injured off self.

1009
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,920
What I'm doing is so I will light Suppose Narendra So I'm going to replace all with not in

1010
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,420
the only.

1011
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,120
Then we'll work.

1012
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,610
Noble,

1013
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:04,810
Um,

1014
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:11,220
the only thing is universally we are following one rule in giraffe taking any random

1015
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,720
default argument we're taking self.

1016
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,570
But I can take anything.

1017
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,110
Let me right.

1018
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,610
So I'm going to replace all with Narendra.

1019
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:27,670
I said,

1020
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,950
that is my name right no see the result.

1021
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,420
There is no change.

1022
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,010
So but generally inversely were falling.

1023
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,510
See if I go with my name.

1024
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,400
If you go with your name,

1025
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,510
you'll get somewhat confusion.
