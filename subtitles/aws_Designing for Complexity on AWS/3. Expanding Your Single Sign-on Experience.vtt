00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.740
[Autogenerated] because it's a single sign in service.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.430
You can also set up a trust between A W,

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.250
S, S, S O and hundreds of other cloud applications.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.670
This will allow your users to authenticate with one set of

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.340
credentials to access different AWS accounts as well as other

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.340
supported external accounts used in your organization.

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.800
You can configure external applications under the applications menu in AWS.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.640
Single sign on here.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.130
You can select a service,

10
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.850
then input the required configuration to set up a trust.

11
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.760
With that service, simply select.

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.140
Add a new application.

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.130
Then you can browse the catalog or search for an application

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.320
you'd like to integrate with single sign on.

15
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.240
I'll look for slack, select the app, then add application.

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.950
Here you'll find instructions and input fields for all of the metadata that

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.730
you'll need to set this service up with your AWS SSO.

18
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.640
I'll go ahead and cancel out because we're not going to set that up.

19
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.620
But now you can see how easy it is to leverage this

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.240
as a true single sign on solution.

21
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.000
See the AWS documentation for a full list of services that support integration with AWS single sign on
