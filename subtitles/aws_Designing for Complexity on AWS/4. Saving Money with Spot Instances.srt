1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,070
[Autogenerated] easy to spot.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,550
Instances or spots for short are unused.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,140
Easy to machines that error available to use at a reduced cost,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,140
sometimes 90% less than on demand prices.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,030
The big difference between spots and other E C two instances is that a

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,270
spot instance can do be interrupted at any time by AWS.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,860
So spots error best suited for stateless,

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,040
fault tolerant workloads that congrats, feli handle failures.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,000
The price for spot instances convey vary by region

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,440
and changes with supply and demand.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,240
AWS provides a spot market to manage bids and spot usage.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,660
Spot instances could be a really good fit to build up large

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,250
worker pools for things like big Data Analytics,

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,870
containerized workloads, C I, C D pipelines,

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,640
web services, image and media rendering and high performance computing.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
You can check out several white papers on the AWS website from

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,730
organizations in various industries who have implemented spot

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,220
instances as part of their operating model and significantly

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,640
reduced their easy to spend.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,330
To use spot instances,

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,700
you create a request that includes the instance type and availability zones,

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,240
as well as the maximum price per hour you are willing to pay.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,140
With the default maximum set to the on demand price.

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,360
If the current spot price is less than your maximum,

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,650
then your request is fulfilled immediately.

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,200
You can terminate your spot instance at any time

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,510
where it may be terminated for you.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,670
If the spot price rises above your maximum or the

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,340
supply of spot instances decreases.

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,340
You also have the option to buy a defined duration spot that will stay

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,040
running from 1 to 6 hours in one hour increments.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,170
This can help simplify what your application has to deal with in

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,920
terms of unexpected instantiate armin ation.

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,940
But the discount isn't quite as big as regular spot instances.

35
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,910
Let's look at an example of running a six hour job across 1000

36
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,790
M five large Linux machines in the US East.

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,640
One region.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,840
If you ran the job with on demand instances, it would cost $576.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,490
If this isn't something you're doing all of the time,

40
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,030
then it really wouldn't make sense to enter into 1003 year all upfront

41
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,740
agreements since the up front payment would be almost $1 million.

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,020
But if you did have that many reserved instances,

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,900
then this job would cost you $222.

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,440
With the reserved instances,

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,170
if you used six hour to find duration spot instances,

46
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,190
you would spend $402 and if you just used normal spot instances,

47
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,540
it would be about $205 even less than the three year reserved instance price.

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,760
AWS has several tools available,

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,290
and there is a lot of third-party support for

50
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:02,000
incorporating spot instances into your workload, so it is definitely a price reduction option worth looking into.
