[Autogenerated] setting a password policy for your I Am and Federated users

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,290
is very common for different compliance requirements.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,460
You can set the policy for I am users in the AWS console,

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,500
and for Federated users you'll need to manage that in

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,220
whatever identity provider you're using.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,150
Along with password policies is the use of a multi factor authentication or I M.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,160
F A device.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,830
You can even create policies to deny certain actions

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,900
unless the user has authenticated with M F.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,640
A.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,520
You can monitor if users are logging into their AWS account,

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,630
how older credentials are and whether or not they have used

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,290
access keys that have been issued to them.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,300
You can also view which rolls error being used to help

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,340
determine if you should remove any unused rolls.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,520
Let's take a look at how to set password policies for I am.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,880
Users will also see how to configure multi factor authentication for

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,780
your users and check on the frequency of user access and roll usage from

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,940
the I am dashboard Select account settings.

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,540
From here, you can set the password policy.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,120
You can see the different options from password length to what

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,730
type of characters to reuse or expiration set Whatever suits your

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,570
organization than save the changes,

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,840
I'll go ahead and enforce a minimum 15 character password.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,340
Now if I go to one of my users and try to change the password.

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,140
If I don't include enough characters, I won't be able to change it.

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,040
Notice how the apply button is grayed out.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,280
Once I've entered enough characters,

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,780
then I can change the password to configure Emma for a user,

30
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,540
select that user than under security credentials.

31
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,340
Select Manage Under assigned MF a device here,

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,580
you can set up the M F a device that you'd like to use.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,240
I'll go with virtual MF a device,

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,660
then follow the necessary steps to configure that MF A

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,040
device once you've correctly configured it,

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,220
select Assign MF A.

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,600
When you select users,

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,830
you'll see a list of all of the I am users forgiven

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,390
account as well as how old their access,

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,110
key and password are.

41
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,840
When you select an individual user under security credentials,

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,240
you can see when they last signed in,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,440
as well as any access keys they have when they're

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,840
created and when they were last used,

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,340
you can deactivate and activate the access keys from here,

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,040
as well as remove an access key altogether under roles,

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,170
you can see the different roles that error defined in your AWS

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,540
account as well as when they were last used.

49
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,130
Keep in mind that there could be a four hour delay from when roles

50
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,240
error used to when they show up on this dashboard.

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,670
This is a helpful way to see what roles are being used and

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:19,000
what roles are not being used and maybe candidates to just be removed from your account.
