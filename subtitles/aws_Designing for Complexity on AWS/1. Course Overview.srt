[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,920
My name is Craig Google lightly and welcome to my course designing for

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,330
complexity on AWS I am a senior software consultant.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,150
Figuring out how you're going to use AWS to implement your

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,660
solutions can quickly turn into a complicated mess.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,760
If you're not leveraging some key tools and best practices to

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,180
manage organizational complexity in this course,

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,570
whether you're just getting started or trying to

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,820
unravel and existing implementation,

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,800
we're going to cover how you can design for complexity on AWS,

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,430
using the proper tools so that your organization can have the capacity,

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,460
security and availability you need.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,940
If you're studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect professional exam,

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,400
you're in the right place.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,370
Some of the major topics that we will cover include

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,780
using AWS organizations I am users, groups,

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,710
policies and Rolls Federation and single sign on

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,440
and cost optimization strategies.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,690
By the end of this course,

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,000
you will be able to implement the best options for setting up a secure,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,070
compliant and cost effective A W s account structure for your organization,

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,820
and have a solid foundation for your exam preparations.

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,140
Before beginning the course, you should have a basic understanding of AWS.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,560
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about managing

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:41,000
a W s for your organization with the designing for complexity on a W S course at Pluralsight.
