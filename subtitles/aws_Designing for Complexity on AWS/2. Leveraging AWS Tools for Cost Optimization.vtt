00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.500
[Autogenerated] savings plans are similar to reserved instances,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.510
which will cover in detail in the next module in that you enter into a

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.420
123 year commitment with a full partial or no upfront payment to receive

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.110
a significant discount over on demand prices.

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.140
However, instead of selecting an instance configuration,

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.690
you're committing to a certain compute spend per hour

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.960
for the duration of the agreement, for example,

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.570
$50 per hour.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.290
The big advantage of savings plans is the flexibility they provide.

10
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.480
Savings plans can automatically apply to any instance family instantiation,

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.310
eyes, tenancy, operating system and region,

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.800
as well as Fargate and Lambda Resource is savings plans are

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.440
easier to manage and could be a great option for accounts that

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.940
have some consistent level of workload.

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.440
You can find out more about savings plans in the AWS cost Explorer.

16
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.690
The Ws Cost Explorer is your dashboard to Grafana

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.290
visualized and analyze your spend.

18
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.270
There are several filters you can apply to get down to the details you need.

19
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.440
This is also where you can set up savings plans.

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.690
AWS budgets allows you to configure custom budgets that will

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.960
automatically alert you when you're AWS.

22
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.740
Costs or usage exceed or are forecasted to exceed the thresholds you set.

23
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.740
This helps you avoid any surprises with your month end bill.

24
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.860
You can also use budgets to monitor and adjust usage as you have a spike

25
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.570
in activity from a new release or additional customers.

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.710
A W s trusted advisor can provide cost optimization suggestions as part of

27
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.170
a support plan such as checking for underutilization of resource is in

28
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.140
providing recommendations for reserved instances.

29
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.030
When you utilize A W S organizations,

30
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.280
you have better visibility into costs as everything

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.140
control up into a single payer account.

32
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.370
If you purchase a savings plan or reserved instances,

33
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.910
you can utilize those at the organization level rather than

34
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.950
having them tied to a single AWS account.

35
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.810
You can also qualify for volume discounts based on the combined

36
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.540
usage of all member accounts in your organization.

37
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.820
By defining the role of member accounts,

38
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.750
you can simplify reports and control costs by limiting services in

39
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.840
different accounts with service control policies.

40
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.610
Finally,

41
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.480
sandbox accounts could be regularly created and
