[Autogenerated] If you find yourself with excess reserved instances,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,850
you can actually sell those on the reserved instance.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,970
Marketplace.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,450
There are several steps you need to take to qualify as a seller.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,040
See the AWS documentation and you'll be paying AWS a commission on the sale.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,050
But the fact that a marketplace exists to sell any reserved instances

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,910
you don't need any more may help your risk assessment.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,820
When deciding whether or not to use reserved instances in your

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,030
organization to purchase reserved instances,

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,040
you'll simply do that in the AWS console.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,780
Each option will list whether it is being sold by AWS or a third-party.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,640
Let's go to the AWS console to see what this looks like.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,470
Go to E.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:58,740
C two, then reserved instances here will select purchase reserved instances.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,030
This screen presents you with different attributes,

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,980
filters that you can use to search for available,

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,580
reserved instances that you can purchase.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:13,440
I'll go with these defaults than select search.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Here you can see the different options for purchase.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,360
One year, three year No upfront, partial up front,

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,740
all up front,

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,490
this particular search showed all of the reserved instances

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,840
from this search are being sold by AWS.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,930
If I change it to t two Nano Notice how Now there is a third

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,370
party seller that is selling an all upfront standard reserved

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,240
instance that has 19 months left on it.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,240
They're asking $47.50 and they have six available.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
You can sometimes obtain a reserved instance at a discounted

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,070
price from a third party seller or a different term length that

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,300
may be more suitable for your situation.

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,860
When you decide what you want,

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,740
you can add it to your cart and complete the purchase.

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't actually want to purchase that right now, so I'll go ahead and hit delete.
