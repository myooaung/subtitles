00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,840
[Autogenerated] Let's go to the AWS console and take a look at where you can

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,300
access the pricing history for spot Instances will launch a few spot instances

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,940
so you can see the options that can affect your price.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,240
And we'll look at the spot instance Adviser,

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,940
which can help you decide which instances to use for spots.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,240
Let's take a look at easy to spot instances in the AWS console.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,340
Under instances, Select spot requests.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,340
First, let's check out some pricing history for spot instances.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,840
Here you can select the operating system instantiate type and date range

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,890
to see the spot price in various availability zones.

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,570
For that configuration,

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,210
let's make the date range a little bit bigger and see

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,360
prices for the M five large we can see,

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,840
the most recent price has stayed at two cents.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,300
When we go back, we can see that it got up a little bit higher than two cents,

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,640
but not much.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,410
This represents a significant savings over the on demand price of 9.6 cents.

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,940
Let's take a look at some other instantiate types.

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,040
As you can see, there is a wide variety of spot instances available for purchase.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,730
Let's take a look at the P 38 XML notice in the US East to see availability

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,960
zone that the spot price is the same as the on demand price.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,210
This would indicate that there is no excess capacity in that

23
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,740
particular availability zone for this instantiate iPod.

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,320
Remember also that pricing is region dependent.

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,230
Let's switch regions and take a look at the pricing for this

26
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,760
same instance in this region noticed the U.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,080
S East one B availability zone had a couple of different events where

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,540
the spot price was the same as the and band price.

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,240
This region also has one availability zone with no excess capacity.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,550
The U.

31
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,940
S East one F as the spot price is the same as the on demand price.

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:21,340
Let's go back to the Ohio region and launch some spot instances.

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,990
Select request spot instances.

34
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,660
Then here you'll select what type of spot you want to create,

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,990
whether you need the same instant size and availability zone

36
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,320
or if you're a little bit more flexible for instances of any

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,460
sign in any availability zone,

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,760
you can also select the defined duration where your spot

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,420
instance is guaranteed to stay active between one and six

40
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,540
hours in one hour increments.

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,770
Keep in mind that this option will cost you more thin regular spots,

42
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,740
but it may be worth it for reduced complexity in your application,

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm going to go with flexible workloads.

44
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,980
Next, you can select a launch template that has everything pre configured,

45
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,240
which is what I'd recommend for using spot instances.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,440
But for this demo, I'll quickly go through some of the options.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,590
Let's change the instance.

48
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:19,740
Type to M five large.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,790
I'll keep the default VPC with any availability zone,

50
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,550
and I'm not going to specify a keep error because I won't be

51
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,700
logging into these instances for capacity.

52
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,040
I want to launch three instances.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
Notice how you can also specify a certain number of V C P use.

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,720
Then AWS will automatically launch various

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,340
instantiate types to match that request.

56
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,350
Here's an example of other instance types that have similar V CPUs and memory,

57
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,940
as well as the spot price for each.

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,100
For the three instances I'm requesting,

59
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,940
it's estimated that I'll pay about 6.2 cents an hour as

60
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,880
opposed to almost 30 cents an hour.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,340
If I used on demand,

62
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,240
I'll acknowledge the warning because I don't need the keep error,

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,440
and we can see that the spot request has been submitted.

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,640
Once you start using spot instances, you can take a look at the savings summary.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,640
In this case, I'm paying six cents instead of 40 cents.

66
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,630
You can view your spot instances from the spot Requests page or with

67
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,540
your normal instances menu here we can see that I was allocated three

68
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,660
our four large instances since they're similar to the M five large and

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,750
that all three are up and running.

70
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:54,940
Once you're done using your spot instances, go back to spot requests.

71
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:03,640
Then you can select the fleet and under actions, select cancel spot request.

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,120
When you cancel the request,

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,240
you can also have it terminate the instances I'll hit confirm,

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,640
and now the request is canceled.

75
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,740
If I go back to instances,

76
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,640
we can see that the three instances are shutting down and terminated.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,740
Here's the spot instance Adviser.

78
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,640
You can select a region and configuration.

79
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,800
Then it will show you several different instance types the average savings

80
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
over on demand and how often those are interrupted by AWS.

81
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,040
This can help you decide what types of instances you should use as spot

82
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,130
instances based on your CPU and memory requirements,

83
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,920
as well as how often those may be interrupted and what you'll need to do in

84
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,840
your application to handle those interruptions gracefully.

85
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,380
Congratulations.

86
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,140
You now understand the cost savings options with reserved instances for easy to

87
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,440
as well as other AWS services that offer reserved models.

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,870
You've seen the reserved instance marketplace and that you may

89
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,890
be able to sell your reserved instances to other AWS customers

90
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,840
if you end up not needing them.

91
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,540
Finally,

92
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,150
you learned how spot instances work and how they could

93
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,340
drastically reduce your e C two spent.

94
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,980
If you're studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional exam.

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:37,000
Best of luck in your preparations. I hope you have found this valuable and thank you for watching.
