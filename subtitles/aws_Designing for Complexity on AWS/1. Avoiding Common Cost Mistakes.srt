[Autogenerated] Hi, This is Greg Golightly and welcome to optimizing costs.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,120
Cost optimization is an area where you really need to know how things work,

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,940
because what you don't know could be costing you a lot more than it needs to.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,500
We're going to start out talking about some common mistakes when it comes to

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,640
cost optimization and how you can avoid making those mistakes.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,580
Next, we'll discuss the tools AWS provides to help you optimize your costs,

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,940
including savings plans.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:41,400
AWS Cost Explorer AWS budgets and AWS Trusted adviser will point out some

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,700
cost management benefits to using AWS organizations.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,580
And finally,

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,780
we'll review some key principles that can help you take a

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,240
proactive approach to cost optimization.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,900
The five common mistakes we're going to look at our e C.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:04,440
To instance type are two instantiation Easy to volumes and snapshots,

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,940
Zombie Instances and S3 storage class.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,650
AWS has several different instance types from general

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,800
computing to hardware accelerated computing.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,100
If we compare the largest general computing M 5 24 x large with

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,510
the largest accelerated computing P 3D n 24 XL,

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,050
there is a significant difference in the hourly on demand

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,010
price for a region about $4.60 an hour,

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,140
versus $31.21 an hour at the time of recording.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,110
Be familiar with the different instance types,

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,270
including new ones that error released on a regular basis.

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,750
And make sure you're using these appropriate

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,040
instantiate type for your compute workload.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,210
Within each instance, Type E.

28
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,610
C two offers a variety of instantiation XYZ.

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,680
For example,

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,430
let's take a look at the M five instants XAML e Notice

31
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,130
the range of sizes from 2 to 96 V.

32
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,360
C.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,940
P apps and from eight gigabytes to 384 gigabytes of memory.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,070
Theon demand difference in price for this region between an M five

35
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,250
large and an M 5 24 extra large is 48 times,

36
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,960
which corresponds to the fact that the 24 XML has 48 times

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,140
as much resource is as the M five large.

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,240
Choosing the right size of instance is a function of

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,840
the workload you're trying to run.

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,680
If you don't know how much compute resource is you need for an application,

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,480
you can enable CloudWatch monitoring on your PC to instances and get basic

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,640
CPU usage and with some customization set up memory usage.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,870
It's important to choose the right size for the job so you don't pay for.

44
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,070
Resource is you don't really need.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,140
The other thing to be aware of is tendency.

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,090
AWS offers dedicated hosts where you are the only

47
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,540
customer on a given physical machine.

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,870
As a result, this one small change can dramatically increased costs.

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,340
Since you're paying for the entire machine.

50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,540
For an M five dedicated host, you'll pay about $5.7 an hour.

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,740
Dedicated hosts are not something you would generally use

52
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,940
unless you have a specific need for one.

53
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,070
Other AWS services like RDS also offer different sizes for different prices.

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,740
So be aware of the options for the AWS service you are using.

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,990
When you launch and C two, you can choose from different volume types,

56
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,420
solid state or hard disk, and there are also options within each type.

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,640
For example, in a certain region,

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,540
these options can do range from $25 to $125 per month for a one terabyte volume.

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,890
Choosing the right storage for your disk performance needs can impact cost,

60
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,750
especially if you have a large number of easy to instances.

61
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,920
Another thing to be aware of with E C two volumes is

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,130
that you are charged for volumes.

63
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,930
Even when you're easy to instances off, Let me say that again.

64
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,920
You can turn off your easy to instance and not pay the hourly compute charge,

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,610
but you will still pay for the volumes you have provisioned.

66
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,760
For example,

67
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,250
suppose you have a one terabyte GP two volume on an easy to instance that

68
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,040
will cost you about $100 per month in most regions.

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,610
Whether you use the easy to or not,

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,790
you also pay storage costs for any snapshots you have taken.

71
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,520
It's important to provision only the storage you

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,710
need for your easy to instances,

73
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,290
then have a strategy to keep track of and delete volumes and

74
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,340
snapshots as they're no longer needed for your workloads.

75
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,400
Zombie instances are instances that error provisioned in your account.

76
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,450
They may be running or stopped,

77
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,300
but no one has ownership or knows what they're doing.

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,210
Other than costing you money each month utilizing a combination of proper I am

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,270
permissions tagging and multi account management can help you avoid zombie

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,470
instances setting up a clear lifecycle for resource is,

81
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,430
and adding in some automated enforcement can help your accounts from

82
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,730
being overrun with zombie instances and volumes.

83
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,640
Some services can do also be turned off or scaled down during off peak times.

84
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,020
Suppose you only need certain resource is during

85
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,740
business hours or 40 hours per week.

86
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,500
By turning them off outside of business hours,

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,750
you'll be cutting your bill by about 75% depending on how frequently you

88
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,940
access your objects and how fast you need to retrieve them.

89
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,640
S3 has several different storage classes to match your use case.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,550
For example,

91
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,140
here are four of the six storage classes offered at the time of recording.

92
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,920
Notice the difference in first by latency for

93
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,640
retrieval from milliseconds two hours,

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,140
as well as the minimum storage duration charge from no minimum to 180 days.

95
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,560
If you stored 100 terabytes of data for one month in an AWS region,

96
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,280
this would be the cost.

97
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,740
Notice the difference in cost between standard and Glacier Deep Archive.

98
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,460
If you used S3 standard for everything,

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,410
you could be paying almost 23 times more than you

100
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,040
need to for long term backup data.

101
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,000
Choosing the proper storage class for your use case can make a big difference in your storage costs
