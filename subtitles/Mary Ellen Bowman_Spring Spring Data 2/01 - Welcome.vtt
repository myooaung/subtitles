00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.000
- Welcome to this course on Spring Data.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.020
The spring project for data store access.

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.050
I'm Mary Ellen Bowman and I'll be leading you through

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.060
this deep dive into Spring Data.

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.000
Coding to databases can be tedious.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.030
It's often requiring repetitive, boilerplate code

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.030
which is difficult to maintain, refactor, and debug.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.040
Upgrading applications to a different kind of data store

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.060
typically results in massive code rewrites

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.030
and developer reeducation.

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.020
Spring Data addresses these issues

12
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.030
by eliminating boilerplate code

13
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.040
and abstracting data store interactions

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.040
into a common repository API.

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.010
We'll begin with an overview of the

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.020
Spring Data umbrella project

17
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.080
and I'll walk you through some examples

18
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.090
that use Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB

19
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.090
and then look at other supported data store modules.

20
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.080
We'll cover query methods and explore cool features.

21
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.040
Such as Spring Data rest, query DSL and auditing.

22
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's dive in.
