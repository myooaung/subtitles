- [Instructor] After finishing this course

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.010
I would encourage you to apply Spring Data repositories

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.080
into a fully running application.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.070
We do just that in my course, Creating Your First

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.030
Spring Boot RESTful Microservice with JPA.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.020
Step by step we construct a Java application

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.070
that leverages several Spring technologies

8
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.080
including Boot, Spring Data JPA,

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.060
Spring Data REST, and Spring Web MVC.

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.090
Thank you for watching.

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.090
Time is precious, game changing

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.000
technologies help spend it wisely.
