00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] I assume that you have

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.020
intermediate-level knowledge of Java version eight,

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.050
and the Spring Container for Dependency Injection.

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.070
Plus, it's good to have experience coding to a database

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.020
in a web application.

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.050
If you are weak in any of these areas,

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.080
I recommend the following courses from our library,

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.010
Java Essentials Training,

9
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.080
Learning Java Lambda Expressions,

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.000
and Learning Spring with Spring Boot.
