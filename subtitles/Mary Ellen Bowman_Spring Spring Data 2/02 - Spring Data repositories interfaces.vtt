00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] And there is.

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.002
Spring Data JPA.

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.000
We get better functionality while writing less code.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.003
In chapter one we learned that Spring Data

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.001
abstracts away from any particular data source

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.000
by following a repository pattern.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.008
Now we're actually going to see

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.003
the implementation of that pattern.

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.009
Spring Data starts with a repository interface

10
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.004
with two bounded type parameters.

11
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.007
The first parameter, T, is the entity class name.

12
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.006
And the second parameter, ID,

13
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:37.000
is the type of the unique ID of the entity.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.004
The repository interface

15
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.001
is just a marker without any methods.

16
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.000
CrudRepository extends from repository

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.009
and declares methods that create, update, read

18
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:52.006
and delete entities and inherit the bounded type parameters.

19
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:56.001
Both repository and CrudRepository are packaged in

20
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.001
com

21
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.000
framework

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.009
data

23
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.009
repository.

24
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:07.001
To create or update, invoke the save or save all methods.

25
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.003
There are now four delete methods in Spring Data V2

26
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.009
to remove entities from the database.

27
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.008
And finally, to read or do lookups,

28
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.004
there are three built in find methods,

29
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:24.000
account method and exist method.

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.008
To declare a repository for your entity,

31
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:31.001
declare a Java interface that extends from CrudRepository

32
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.004
and provide the appropriate bounded type parameters.

33
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:38.000
So using the student entity we spoke of in the last chapter,

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.007
we create a student repository

35
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.008
and extend it from CrudRepository

36
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.003
with student as the first bounded type,

37
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.004
and integer as the second.

38
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:51.000
The ID of the student entity is an integer.

39
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.002
By extending from CrudRepository,

40
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.009
the interface declares the contract

41
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.009
for all the built in methods.

42
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.008
The create and update methods for the student.

43
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:06.003
The student delete methods.

44
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.000
And the read methods.
