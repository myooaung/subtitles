00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] The most popular ORM framework

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.020
is JPA.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.080
So how did that happen?

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.000
What's the backstory of JPA?

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the early to mid 2000'S,

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.050
ORM frameworks arrived.

7
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.010
The most popular were Hibernate, TopLink, and IBATIS.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.010
Different frameworks diverge development

9
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.090
so industry experts work together

10
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.050
to form an ORM standard.

11
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.030
The result was the

12
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.070
Java persistence application programming interface.

13
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.070
Through the Java Community process,

14
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.020
the JPA spec version 2.0 final a.k.a. JSR 317

15
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.010
was released in December 2009.

16
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.000
JPA is a specification,

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.070
it is not an actual framework.

18
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.010
Framework, such as Hibernate and EclipseLink,

19
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.060
as well as Java Enterprise Edition compliant

20
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.020
application servers

21
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.010
provide the implementation.

22
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.020
So even if we speak about a Java application

23
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.010
that uses JPA,

24
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010
it is actually using another provider

25
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.090
following the JPA spec.

26
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.020
The spec includes metadata declarations

27
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.040
to map Java classes, now called entities,

28
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.060
to database tables.

29
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
An EntityManager creates, reads, updates,

30
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.050
and deletes the entities.

31
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.000
Changes to the entity's state

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.070
are reflected back to the database.

33
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.070
The entity metadata is in the form of .xml files,

34
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.050
or within Java classes, via Java annotations.

35
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.000
This tutorial only demonstrates Java annotations.

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.010
Please refer to the JPA specification

37
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.000
if you prefer xml.
