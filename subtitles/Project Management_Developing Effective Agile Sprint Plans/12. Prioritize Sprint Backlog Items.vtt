00:00:01.212 --> 00:00:03.938
In step 3, we want to prioritize the sprint backlog items.

2
00:00:03.938 --> 00:00:04.590
But first,

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.813
I want to make the point and rationale that prioritization is one of

4
00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:12.445
the most important aspects of the planning process.

5
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:16.515
Have you ever been stuck in a sprint planning meeting where everyone has

6
00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.417
a different opinion of what to do first in a sprint?

7
00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:23.334
So choosing the right thing to do allows you to maximize the

8
00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:25.764
value delivered in the sprint to the business.

9
00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:29.408
Having a shared understanding of priorities empowers a

10
00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.863
team to move in a uniform direction.

11
00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:36.636
Hopefully everyone can come together and support the product owner's priorities.

12
00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.421
And if the top items are known, well understood,

13
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.433
and we all appreciate the value to the business,

14
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:47.358
we can all better focus or refocus towards a common goal.

15
00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:49.755
Now let's set the stage for the product owner.

16
00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:52.398
The full context is important to know and understand

17
00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:55.149
prior to the prioritization discussions.

18
00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.908
The goals of the next sprint or iteration should be clear

19
00:00:57.908 --> 00:00:59.666
and described by the product owner.

20
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:03.199
The results of the last sprint or iteration are known,

21
00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.161
and those results and feedback are incorporated into

22
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.664
the sprint planning's discussions.

23
00:01:08.664 --> 00:01:12.444
The backlog items should contain items that are of reasonable size and

24
00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:15.426
could fit several into this iteration or sprint.

25
00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.704
Many times, product owners just want it all,

26
00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:20.518
and they may want to change the length of the sprint.

27
00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:21.182
If so,

28
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:24.041
try and challenge that by stating productivity may

29
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.607
actually suffer by doing that.

30
00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:27.359
Limited scope.

31
00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.207
We only need to figure out what needs to go into this iteration.

32
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:35.293
Don't spend too much time or any time, if possible,

33
00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:38.514
talking about backlog items that are not in the sprint.

34
00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:38.722
Certainly,

35
00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:40.983
you will talk about some that may be on the margin

36
00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:42.869
of being in or out of the sprint.

37
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.875
That is normal,

38
00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:47.292
but the team can get certainly sidetracked by talking about

39
00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.533
items that are not relevant at this time,

40
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.317
so watch out for that.

41
00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:55.587
So the team has the full context in which to make priority decisions.

42
00:01:55.587 --> 00:02:00.799
Goals, previous sprint results, and right size in the items for the next sprint.

43
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.815
The product owner can probably set these priorities fairly easily with

44
00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:08.871
knowledge of this context and armed with the product vision,

45
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:13.036
the product roadmap, and the release plans as a backdrop.

46
00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:16.343
You may be wondering how you go about determining priorities.

47
00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:17.349
Let's find out.

48
00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.678
Let's go through some great guidelines or questions I would like you to

49
00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:23.571
ask your team during sprint planning that will help you better

50
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:26.266
prioritize your backlogs and guide your decisions.

51
00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:30.436
Which items provide the most value to the customer?

52
00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:34.836
The product owner will identify them within the context we just discussed.

53
00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:37.905
Which items provide the most benefit to the business?

54
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:40.740
Again, the product owner will identify them.

55
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.443
What is the lowest hanging fruit?

56
00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:46.126
You might consider what might be the easiest items to do.

57
00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.496
That is something that can be quickly deployed to provide value.

58
00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:51.221
Which items are the riskiest?

59
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:55.392
Maybe you hold off at a risky item even if it provides much value.

60
00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:58.357
Maybe for this sprint planning the risk is still too high,

61
00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:02.687
and maybe other items need to be in place before the risk can come down.

62
00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:06.129
Which items result in the highest cost if not done now?

63
00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.225
This is known as the cost of delaying, the cost of not doing something,

64
00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:12.380
so consider that.

65
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.562
What are the dependencies between items?

66
00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.867
Some items may be dependent on each other,

67
00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:22.123
or a feature must be in place before another one can be implemented.

68
00:03:22.123 --> 00:03:25.303
Which items contribute most to the sprint goal?

69
00:03:25.303 --> 00:03:28.367
Be sure you circle back around and ensure the team

70
00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.749
agrees and understands the sprint goals,

71
00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.213
which will act as your guidepost.

72
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.549
Now let's look at our results of prioritization.

73
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.636
Here we carry forward our story points we estimated in step 2,

74
00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:42.030
and the team has prioritized three user stories.

75
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.107
And this is the priority order: story 7, then 2, and then 1.

76
00:03:46.107 --> 00:03:48.561
And by the way, when we started the process,

77
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.546
the stories were in a different order.

78
00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:53.612
Through our discussions, we have rearranged them.

79
00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:54.478
When this happens,

80
00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:58.127
I always feel much better because it usually reveals more teamwork,

81
00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:01.801
deeper understanding of the business domain by the developers,

82
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:05.551
and the product owner knowing just what he or she wants next.

83
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:10.000
But will it fit into the sprint? Let's see.
