1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,531
If the team composition is changed, then the velocity will change,

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:06,860
and there are many factors that can cause this to happen.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,407
People can be sick, on vacation, or paid time off,

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:13,076
and that will certainly drag velocity down.

5
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,174
Temporary reduction in team size.

6
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:19,053
Maybe management had to move some of your team to other temporary assignments.

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:19,692
People issues.

8
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:22,686
Life happens, and life can have an effect on people.

9
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:27,186
Be sensitive to your team's personal issues as much as is feasible and within

10
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:30,435
the norm to view human resource policies and procedures.

11
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,219
Being cognitive of your team member's issues and address any

12
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,010
issues will help keep velocity on track.

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,331
Turnover.

14
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,929
If you lose a team member, you will have less velocity.

15
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,300
Yes, right in the middle of a sprint, someone may leave your company.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,589
Ouch.

17
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:46,359
With a new hire, there may be skill set differences,

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,177
and it may take time to bring them up to speed.

19
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:53,368
Also, a new hire to the team or someone who transfers into the team may,

20
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:56,338
in fact, reduce your velocity, hopefully temporarily,

21
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:59,247
as they become familiar with their teammates,

22
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:03,482
Agile, technology, and the business domain the velocity will increase over time.

23
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:06,446
Organizational issues such as a company reorganization,

24
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:07,988
new bosses,

25
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:12,063
new relationships can reduce your velocity because people can be

26
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:15,260
distracted or concerned about what is going on within the

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,315
organization and how it will affect them.

28
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,858
The most effective Scrum teams that I have witnessed

29
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:24,367
have worked together consistently, at least as a core group,

30
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,287
for some time.

31
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:28,966
If your organization is having difficulty keeping teams together,

32
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:32,287
then there is an organizational impediment that must be addressed.

33
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:36,822
Organizations that can give work to teams rather than reconfiguring teams to

34
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:47,000
match the work will have more success with Agile and Scrum. Your velocity will rise and stabilize with a solid, consistent team.
