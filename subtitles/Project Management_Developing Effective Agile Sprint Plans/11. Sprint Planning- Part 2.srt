Sprint Planning: Part 2.

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:04,950
Now we have a nice scrubbed backlog with estimates,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,207
so let's dive into prioritization and using velocity

4
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:10,242
to determine our sprint goals.

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:12,883
Here's a quick recap of sprint planning part 1.

6
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:16,348
You want to prepare for sprint planning by first assembling your team and

7
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:19,081
reviewing any feedback from the previous sprint demo,

8
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,703
review, and retrospective.

9
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:21,000
Next,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,891
we find the backlog by ensuring that the items in the backlog slated for

11
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,615
this sprint are in general accurate and acceptable.

12
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:34,000
And lastly, determine estimates for each item. Now let's see which items make the cut.
