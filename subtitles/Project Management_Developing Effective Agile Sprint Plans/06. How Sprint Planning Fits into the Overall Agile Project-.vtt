00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:05.529
In order to see just where sprint planning fits into the overall Agile project,

2
00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.562
let's start by walking through the Agile project lifecycle.

3
00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:08.976
First,

4
00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.804
we have our Agile project from planning through

5
00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.922
releases in the project retrospective.

6
00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:17.388
Next, we have the release with release planning,

7
00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:21.464
one or more iterations, and the release retrospective.

8
00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:24.686
Next, we have the sprint or iteration with the sprint planning,

9
00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:28.011
the daily work, and ending with the sprint demo,

10
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.376
review, and retrospective.

11
00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:33.992
Lastly, the daily work is comprised of the daily standup,

12
00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.864
work tasks, and with update progress and actions.

13
00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:41.204
To me, the real heartbeat of Agile/Scrum is the sprint.

14
00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:45.168
This is where most of the action, that is time,

15
00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:50.174
resources, effort, are expended over the entire Agile project lifecycle.

16
00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:52.566
This course is focusing on the spring planning,

17
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.646
but sprint planning does not live in a vacuum.

18
00:00:55.646 --> 00:01:00.063
You must understand the full context and implications of the entire Agile

19
00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:03.587
project artifacts to enable efficient sprint planning,

20
00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.958
such as release planning.

21
00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.716
Since sprints are contained in releases,

22
00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.591
the release retrospective since you'll be getting

23
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:13.202
feedback from the release retrospective,

24
00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:16.591
which will positively affect sprint planning.

25
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.450
The daily standups.

26
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.959
Since you'll be getting bottom-up feedback on the progress of the sprint,

27
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:27.045
you will learn a great deal about how good your sprint planning really is.

28
00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.690
Now, for a point of view.

29
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.314
Releases: When and How Many?

30
00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:36.526
Sprint, sprint, sprint, release was common in the early days of Agile/Scrum,

31
00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:41.224
but today, with continuous integration, it is much easier to release more often.

32
00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:44.659
Continuous integration is the practice of merging all developer working

33
00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.619
copies to a shared source mainline several times a day.

34
00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.113
The automated tools today make it very easy.

35
00:01:52.113 --> 00:01:54.713
More random releases such as sprint, sprint,

36
00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.347
release, or sprint, release,

37
00:01:56.347 --> 00:02:00.839
or some combination thereof can be performed based on what the customer wants,

38
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.759
but some customers just can't absorb a new software release that often.

39
00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.274
Remember, they have to install, possibly test, and sign off on every release.

40
00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:14.051
Of course, you can still make releases and just not release them to the customer.

41
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:17.171
This will keep your release and sprint tempo moving forward.

42
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:17.836
To me,

43
00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.684
I prefer a very regular release cycle with the same

44
00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:22.297
number of sprints contained within.

45
00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:26.064
This sets appropriate expectations and deliverables.

46
00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:28.738
Again, Agile evolves, as it should.

47
00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:31.670
The business world, people, skills, ideas,

48
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.730
and philosophies will keep evolving and Agile with it.

49
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.000
Now let's take a look at backlogs, which is one of the most key elements of sprint planning.
