1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:04,926
Here's an example of a user story: Students can search for,

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:07,438
find, select, and enroll in classes.

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:08,772
Not too bad of a story.

4
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:12,526
For now, I'll call this my first pass at writing the user story.

5
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,434
Now let's see how it does against the traits.

6
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:17,641
So one idea is to go quickly around the room and get

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,046
everyone's rough and not so perfect opinion to see how the

8
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:23,874
traits score on this user story.

9
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:24,394
Independent.

10
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:28,513
Maybe the team says, hey, pretty good, seems to stand on its own.

11
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:29,054
Negotiable.

12
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,137
Pretty good.

13
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:33,335
Seems to stand on its own maybe is because it can be

14
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,064
pushed to another sprint quite easily.

15
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:35,623
Valuable.

16
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:36,740
Really good.

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,997
The customer says they must have this as early as possible.

18
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,200
That's value.

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,727
Estimable.

20
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,360
Good, maybe a little tricky.

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,615
I'm not sure of the full data model at this point says somebody on the team.

22
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:48,966
Small.

23
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,669
Not sure.

24
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:51,777
Maybe there's a ton of data.

25
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:52,411
Testable.

26
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,678
Pretty sure.

27
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,093
So the team may come to the conclusion to begin an estimation exercise or

28
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:02,201
maybe add a research user story for the next sprint to drill into the user

29
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,569
story deeper and gather more information.

30
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:09,041
Now, the English language has so many ways to say the same thing.

31
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,334
Will all user stories be written in the same way?

32
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:15,899
Maybe we need some sort of template to follow to try and ensure

33
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,070
that user stories have some sort of consistency.

34
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,239
How about a template?

35
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,541
Let's check it out.

36
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,960
Let's look at using a template to help us write better

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,366
and more consistent user stories.

38
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:33,480
As a type of user, I want some goal so that some reason.

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,909
They type of user is the who or the role.

40
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,525
Some goal is what you are trying to accomplish.

41
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,705
The some reason is the benefit or outcome of doing

42
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,920
this user story in the first place.

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,479
Now this was our first pass earlier.

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,903
Students can search for, find, select, and enroll in classes.

45
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:56,510
Now, here is our second pass: As a student,

46
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:04,321
I can search for, find, and select classes so that I can successfully enroll.

47
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:05,703
Now that's even better.

48
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:10,501
Plus, if we have multiple authors, we can normalize the writing styles.

49
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:15,194
Quality user stories are so important and imperative to get as

50
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:18,214
right as possible since they drive the estimates,

51
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:20,893
the requirements, and the project.

52
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:25,852
Now someone may say, hey, we're agile, so we can make corrections downstream.

53
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:28,665
Sure you can, but I really must say,

54
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:33,057
getting these pretty close upfront saves time and money.

55
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:36,168
User stories don't have to use a template like this,

56
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,071
but it certainly is a good idea.

57
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:42,471
Now let's see why templates are a good idea on the next slide.

58
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:46,663
Why should we consider to use a common template for user stories?

59
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:51,736
I have three good reasons, all of which will streamline sprint planning.

60
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:55,139
The first reason: Roles in the first person.

61
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,664
Something noteworthy happens when requirements are put into the first person.

62
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:04,475
Clearly by saying as a student, I can search for,

63
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:04,878
find,

64
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,952
and select classes so that I can enroll puts a person's mind

65
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,906
into visualizing he or she in that role.

66
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:13,669
Very valuable.

67
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,342
The next reason helps the product owner or development team

68
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:20,573
more easily understand the user stories.

69
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:24,429
Grasping the user story's intent is critical to the

70
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,608
entire Agile and sprint planning process.

71
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:31,398
Having a structure to the stories actually helps the product owner prioritize.

72
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:34,932
If the product backlog is a clutter of things,

73
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:39,705
then the product owner must work harder to understand what the feature is,

74
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,601
who benefits from it, and what the value is,

75
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:46,065
let alone the development team trying to do the same thing.

76
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:51,778
The next reason: Helps keep user stories concise and contained.

77
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:55,968
But if you think the template may at times suppress the intent of the story,

78
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:58,338
then correct it by modifying the template,

79
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,530
or come up with your own template.

80
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,976
Adapt and be flexible.

81
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,929
Now for one more idea about your backlog design.

82
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,550
Why attributes enhance user stories,

83
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,453
or I'd rather word it why attributes greatly enhance user stories.

84
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:15,906
Think about it for a moment.

85
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:19,524
What else would you like to know about each user story that

86
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,302
would help you with your discussions?

87
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:23,796
Let's see some examples.

88
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:28,698
One attribute may be the epic it belongs to so that you can refer to it and

89
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:32,134
understand the fuller context of that particular user story.

90
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:34,254
Another, priority, certainly.

91
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:38,390
This is coming from the product owner and a critical part of the user story.

92
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,712
Remember,

93
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,265
the reason why a user story is prioritized high is that it can

94
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,381
be more immediately applied to the business,

95
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:47,015
therefore, adding value.

96
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:49,307
Next, the estimate either in story points,

97
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:53,273
hours, or another unit of measure your team fully understands.

98
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:56,384
Maybe a target release or sprint number.

99
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,698
This will help you plan and schedule the user story.

100
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:00,443
Or even more,

101
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:04,553
if you think you want to add a few attributes that help you with the process,

102
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:05,356
please do.

103
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:09,693
Now that we talked about breaking down user stories into smaller,

104
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,195
more concise user stories, well, that's great,

105
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:16,948
but we do not want to lose sight of the higher level "user

106
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:22,000
story" that we're going to call the epic. Let's check that out.
