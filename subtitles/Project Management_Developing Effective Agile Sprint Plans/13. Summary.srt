00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:03,406
Here is the summary of this module.

2
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:04,011
Agile foundation.

3
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:06,731
We learned there are four process groups.

4
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:11,099
The first is projects, which is the overall container of the Agile effort.

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,028
The second is releases, and projects have releases.

6
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:17,037
That is a project is made up of a series of product releases.

7
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:18,900
The third is iterations.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,819
There are multiple iterations per release just as there

9
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,510
are multiple releases per project.

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,877
Also, in Scrum terminology, an iteration is known as a sprint.

11
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:28,374
And the fourth is daily work,

12
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:32,128
which is what the team does every day within an iteration or sprint.

13
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:35,321
Several days of work make up an iteration or sprint.

14
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:37,103
Next, Agile participants.

15
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,502
An Agile or Scrum team has three specific roles.

16
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:41,585
The fist is product owner,

17
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:45,052
who is the person responsible for managing the business requirements.

18
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,456
The product owner has a very key and critical role

19
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:51,188
of gathering the requirements, ordering or prioritizing the requirements,

20
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:54,469
and ascertaining the value of each to the business.

21
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,300
The next is the development team.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,795
And because Agile/Scrum teams are cross- functional,

23
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,689
a development team includes testers, designers,

24
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:05,190
OPs engineers, or any other skills or capabilities required,

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,471
in addition to developers.

26
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,634
Lastly, in the Scrum world,

27
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:12,796
the Scrum Master role is added to facilitate the Scrum process itself.

28
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:16,014
In the absence of a Scrum Master, there may be a project manager,

29
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:18,712
leader, or technical lead fulfilling that role.

30
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:23,085
To me, the real heartbeat of Agile/Scrum projects is the sprint.

31
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:26,230
This is where most of the action, that is time,

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,830
resources, effort, are expended over the entire Agile project lifecycle.

33
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,137
Backlogs: Driving Agile projects forward.

34
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,217
Key to your success is that you need to ensure you

35
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,907
have a healthy backlog process,

36
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:42,552
which means having quality backlog items and a

37
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,581
quality backlog management process.

38
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,407
We discussed that the initial backlog may be fuzzy,

39
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,145
could be unclear, may even have multiple writing styles.

40
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:55,386
So in our planning meetings, we want to transform those stories into succinct,

41
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:59,414
and clear, and, if possible, using a single writing style.

42
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:02,133
User stories and INVEST.

43
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,405
We discussed that writing user stories follows the INVEST checklist,

44
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,907
and it yields better user stories.

45
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:10,963
Those traits are independent, negotiable,

46
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:15,036
valuable, estimable, small, and testable.

47
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:17,999
Using user story templates are important for three

48
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,190
reasons: Roles are in the first person,

49
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,417
templates help the product owner or the development team

50
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,968
more easily understand the user stories,

51
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:31,255
and lastly, templates help keep user stories concise and contained.

52
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:35,056
Leveraging SMART for writing better task descriptions.

53
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:38,441
We presented a checklist for you to use to validate the quality of your

54
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,518
task descriptions to ensure that they are specific,

55
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:45,185
measurable, achievable, relevant, and timeboxed.

56
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:52,000
In the next module, we'll be doing a deep dive into planning sprints effectively. See you there.
