Hello.

2
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.997
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:07.117
I will be presenting the introduction to the course,

4
00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:09.921
Developing Effective Agile Sprint Plans.

5
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.814
There may be one or more reasons why you're taking my course.

6
00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.509
Here might be a few: New to agile/sprint planning; familiar,

7
00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.289
but ready for more; having sprint planning challenges; looking to

8
00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.580
improve; want a deeper understanding of sprint planning,

9
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.396
release planning,

10
00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:29.699
and project planning and how they all interrelate with each other; or you think,

11
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.857
well, maybe agile/sprint just won't work in my environment.

12
00:00:32.857 --> 00:00:35.682
So if you're challenged with creating rapid solid sprint

13
00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.435
plans and struggling with mid- sprint issues,

14
00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.197
or incomplete work at the end of a sprint,

15
00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:47.000
or even the treatment of bugs and when to apply spikes, well, then this course is for you.
