1
00:00:00,947 --> 00:00:03,242
Here are some resources you might want to consider.

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:06,447
Agile tools are project management tools designed

3
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,498
to support an Agile methodology.

4
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:13,091
Whether it's Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, or other hybrid agile methods.

5
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,306
Scrum certification.

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,624
You may want to consider getting certified in Scrum.

7
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:18,388
But which certifications should you take?

8
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,065
Well, we'll touch on that soon.

9
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:21,037
And lastly,

10
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:24,949
consider joining professional organizations like user groups and

11
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:27,328
certainly taking more Pluralsight courses.

12
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:32,560
Now let's go a little deeper into each one of these resources.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,689
Here's a partial list of Agile tools.

14
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,867
And there are a ton of them out there, and I will not promote any one of them.

15
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,610
You need to pick the best for your needs certainly.

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,189
So figure out your key requirements, and pick the best one for you.

17
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,330
These seem to be the top 10 at the moment,

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,727
but this is a dynamic world, and vendors may come and go,

19
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:54,595
but this gives you a good place to start.

20
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,893
You might consider getting Scrum certified.

21
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,275
During the past decade,

22
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:03,136
demand for Scrum Master training and certifications has increased substantially.

23
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:07,033
There are many sources of certifications, and here are some examples.

24
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:12,623
Scrum Alliance, scrum.org, PMI (Project Management Institute),

25
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:15,948
the ICAgile (International Consortium for Agile),

26
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:20,697
and lastly, Scaled Agile Academy.

27
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:23,193
Professional organizations and Pluralsight.

28
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:27,319
Now, professional organizations, there are dozens and dozens of them out there.

29
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,730
Do some research, and maybe first attend several,

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,550
but maybe pick two or three and focus on those.

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,073
Try to also find local user groups so they are easy to attend.

32
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:41,174
I think face-to-face activities will help you make more connections with others,

33
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,900
and you can learn from them.

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,014
Meetup.com and other sites allow you to search and find great forums to try out.

35
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,303
And, of course, conferences.

36
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,147
Now, they usually will cost you some money,

37
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:53,640
but maybe your company will pay for, or maybe,

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,133
if it's important enough for you, you might want to pay for it.

39
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,349
It may be a great investment in your future.

40
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,892
And, of course, Pluralsight.

41
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:09,000
Just log on, and go to the search screen, and enter in keywords like Agile and Scrum to find the best courses for you.
