00:01.040 --> 00:08.250
Hello everyone in this lesson we will begin building our Contact Us page first.

00:08.270 --> 00:15.440
We will learn how to embed an interactive Google map onto our page and we will also learn how to add

00:15.440 --> 00:22.040
a contact form to the page so visitors can fill out a few fields their name their e-mail address and

00:22.040 --> 00:23.990
the message they want to send us.

00:23.990 --> 00:28.770
So that way they can send us an email without knowing our email address.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.670
Without further ado let's jump into the action and try to add a Google map to our page.

00:34.670 --> 00:35.120
All right.

00:35.120 --> 00:42.020
So here's the homepage of my web site and if I use the navigation menu to go to our Contact Us page

00:43.320 --> 00:49.190
we see that at the moment it only has one sentence of filler or placeholder content.

00:49.350 --> 00:56.430
So let's make our first goal to remove this placeholder text and instead add an interactive Google map.

00:56.460 --> 01:02.100
So that way visitors of our Web site can see where our hypothetical business is located and they will

01:02.100 --> 01:09.370
be only one click away from getting Google map directions from their location to our businesses location.

01:09.480 --> 01:09.880
OK.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.930
So if I want to edit this Contact Us page.

01:12.930 --> 01:19.380
The first step is to just look up in the top black add minbar and we can use this edit page to link

01:20.360 --> 01:23.780
from the screen let's begin editing this content.

01:24.170 --> 01:35.750
So I will delete this and instead say our main corporate office is located in downtown New York City

01:36.530 --> 01:41.530
and then maybe right below that sentence we will include an interactive Google map here.

01:41.750 --> 01:47.870
Now if we want a Google map our next step is to open a new tab in our web browser or a new window in

01:47.870 --> 01:49.070
our web browser.

01:49.310 --> 01:57.020
So in this new window perform a Google search for Google Maps we are looking for maps dot Google dot

01:57.020 --> 01:57.530
com.

01:57.530 --> 02:04.580
So when you find that go ahead and click on it and from this screen we can use the top left search field

02:04.790 --> 02:07.910
to search for any address we can think of.

02:07.910 --> 02:12.480
So if you have a business office go ahead and type in the address for that office here.

02:12.740 --> 02:21.230
In my case just as an example I will type in Times Square New York City.

02:21.320 --> 02:21.810
All right.

02:21.820 --> 02:27.070
And now if your business already shows up as one of these circle locations you can just click on it

02:27.490 --> 02:30.480
or you can literally just click anywhere on the map.

02:30.490 --> 02:37.680
So for example if I click right here it created this little marker and now down here towards the bottom

02:37.680 --> 02:40.890
center of the screen if I click on this location

02:44.030 --> 02:46.720
that updates this left hand panel of the screen.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.800
And now what we're looking for is this button right here that reads share.

02:52.160 --> 02:59.990
So go ahead and click on the share icon and then within this pop up content click on embed map

03:02.530 --> 03:03.120
perfect.

03:03.130 --> 03:04.680
This is what we are looking for.

03:04.870 --> 03:09.740
So you'll notice that in this field Google is giving us a bit of code.

03:09.790 --> 03:13.950
Now with this code highlighted just go ahead and copy it to your clipboard.

03:14.500 --> 03:19.910
And now jump back to the browser tab or browser window where you have WordPress open.

03:20.110 --> 03:26.680
So here I am back in my wordpress admin area and I'm editing the Contact Us page and now it's just as

03:26.680 --> 03:28.840
simple as pasting in that code.

03:28.870 --> 03:31.810
So remember we wanted to add the Google map right about here.

03:31.810 --> 03:38.710
So with my cursor there that looks good but let's be sure to switch from visual mode into text mode

03:38.740 --> 03:41.080
because we want to paste in code.

03:41.350 --> 03:49.360
So click on text here and now we can get rid of this non-breaking space character and now simply just

03:49.360 --> 03:51.720
paste in your clipboard.

03:51.870 --> 03:54.240
It's not necessary but just to stay organized.

03:54.240 --> 04:00.230
Why don't we add a space or a new line in between our sentence and the Google Code.

04:00.420 --> 04:05.020
OK and now we can go ahead and switch back to the visual mode instead of the text mode.

04:08.050 --> 04:10.460
And there see our interactive Google map.

04:10.510 --> 04:17.990
So let's go ahead and click this blue update button in the right hand side bar OK and we see this message

04:17.990 --> 04:23.530
page was successfully updated and we can use this view page link to check out the front end of our Web

04:23.530 --> 04:24.300
site.

04:24.710 --> 04:26.720
And there it is perfect.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.250
So now visitors of our website can click and drag or zoom in and out.

04:31.250 --> 04:38.740
On this map and they can also click the directions button here and there just one click away from getting

04:38.740 --> 04:42.640
step by step google directions to our office.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.080
All right.

04:43.090 --> 04:46.350
So we successfully added a Google map to our page.

04:46.420 --> 04:54.880
Let's change gears now and our next goal for our Contact Us page is to add a form down here that visitors

04:54.880 --> 04:57.530
can fill out to send us a message.

04:57.730 --> 05:02.320
So there will be fields for them to enter their name their email address and then a message that they

05:02.320 --> 05:07.960
want to send us and then they can click a submit button and wordpress will automatically take their

05:07.960 --> 05:10.680
message and send it to us via e-mail.

05:10.750 --> 05:16.420
So that way our e-mail address stays relatively private and it's not just up on the web for all spam

05:16.420 --> 05:18.130
robots to gather.

05:18.130 --> 05:24.660
Now out of the box by default WordPress does not have the ability to create a contact form.

05:24.690 --> 05:28.860
However we know that we can leverage the power of plugins.

05:29.050 --> 05:36.980
So let's jump back to our WordPress admin dashboard area and in the left hand menu click on plug ins

05:38.400 --> 05:44.910
we are going to search for and install a new plug in that will allow us to create a contact form.

05:45.030 --> 05:48.120
So we're going to need to use the Add New plug in.

05:48.120 --> 05:48.960
Link.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.900
So click on Add new and from this screen.

05:52.940 --> 06:03.620
Let's use this top right search field and search for contact form 7 OK.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.780
And the first result is indeed contact form 7.

06:07.780 --> 06:13.930
This is a great plug in and you can see that I'm not alone in thinking that it has over a million active

06:13.940 --> 06:18.010
installs and an average rating of four and a half stars.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.080
This plug in has been around for years.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.400
It's an awesome solution.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.240
So let's go ahead and click the install now button.

06:26.700 --> 06:34.830
Once that's complete we can then click activate and now with that plugin activated if we look in our

06:34.830 --> 06:40.580
left hand sidebar we will see a new option named contact.

06:40.590 --> 06:47.670
Let's go ahead and click on contact and from the screen I want to draw your attention to this area.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.750
This screen will show us all of the different contact forms we have.

06:51.830 --> 06:58.100
Currently we just have the one form that the plug in creates for us automatically by default.

06:58.340 --> 07:02.890
And for our website and our purposes I think this is the only form that we will need.

07:03.050 --> 07:07.850
Now in a few minutes we will indeed learn how to customize and edit the form.

07:07.910 --> 07:14.470
But for now to get started let's just learn how to add the form to our Contact Us page.

07:14.510 --> 07:20.960
So right here we will see something called a short code a short code is a piece of code that you can

07:20.960 --> 07:26.860
copy and paste into the main content area of field for a page or a post.

07:26.870 --> 07:27.790
So check this out.

07:27.890 --> 07:31.790
Let's go ahead and select and copy this short code right here.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.010
So select it and then click copy and with that in my clipboard Now let's jump over to my contact page.

07:40.060 --> 07:46.740
So in the left hand side bar let's click on pages we want to work on the Contact Us page.

07:46.760 --> 07:53.330
So let's click that OK and remember we want to add the contact form right below this Google map.

07:53.330 --> 07:58.350
So I would just click right about here to place my cursor after the map and then push enter or drop

07:58.350 --> 07:59.730
down to a new line.

07:59.990 --> 08:04.940
And now let's just paste in our clipboard and there's that short code.

08:04.970 --> 08:10.700
Now this might just look like code to you and I put WordPress will interpret this and know what to do

08:10.700 --> 08:11.420
with it.

08:11.420 --> 08:12.210
So check this out.

08:12.230 --> 08:18.860
If we go ahead and click the blue update button in the right hand corner and we see page successfully

08:18.860 --> 08:19.650
updated.

08:19.730 --> 08:26.240
And if we use this link to preview the front end of our website below the Google map is indeed a contact

08:26.240 --> 08:30.990
form and now visitors of our Web site can simply fill out these fields.

08:31.010 --> 08:39.170
So for your name they might say Jondo for their email address they might say Jondo at John Doe dot gov

08:40.040 --> 08:43.290
for the subject line they might say hello.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.100
I'd like to work with you.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.360
And then they just enter a brief message.

08:48.410 --> 08:49.360
Hello.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.370
Can I hire you.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.890
Aurum some Hello world.

08:54.170 --> 08:57.860
And finally they click the send button and then Word Press.

08:57.860 --> 09:03.130
Behind the scenes will take this information that they entered and send it to us.

09:03.140 --> 09:10.540
The owner of the Web site in an e-mail so I clicked the send button and now we see Thank you for your

09:10.540 --> 09:11.140
message.

09:11.140 --> 09:14.370
It has been sent and you'll have to take my word for it.

09:14.380 --> 09:19.990
But my smartphone just didn't because I received an email with the data that we just filled out.

09:20.170 --> 09:25.190
OK so we successfully added a contact form to the Contact Us page.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.780
Now before we bring this lesson to a close.

09:27.940 --> 09:32.050
Let's learn how to customize or edit this form.

09:32.050 --> 09:39.400
So for example instead of just these fields imagine we want to add a new field and imagine its name

09:39.400 --> 09:41.090
or label reads.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.930
What are you interested in.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.200
And then instead of a text field that the user can type in.

09:46.340 --> 09:53.790
Imagine it's a dropdown menu and they can choose between photography advertising or graphic design.

09:54.030 --> 09:57.890
Ok so let's go and set that up and add that new field right now.

09:57.940 --> 10:06.400
So let's jump back to our admin dashboard and in the sidebar let's click on the contact item again.

10:06.410 --> 10:09.030
At this moment we only have the one form.

10:09.050 --> 10:11.670
So let's go ahead and click on it to edit it.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.250
All right.

10:13.250 --> 10:16.920
And this is a brand new screen that we have never seen before.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.910
So let's take a moment to analyze what we were looking at.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.030
So up here we see the short code that we already copied and pasted to add the form to our page and then

10:26.030 --> 10:31.950
moving down here is the area where we can actually customize and edit the form.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.440
So this code that we see here is our current form.

10:35.540 --> 10:41.420
I know code can be scary and intimidating but let's just go over this line by line because I don't think

10:41.420 --> 10:43.480
it's as scary as you think it is.

10:43.490 --> 10:49.610
So within this first chunk of code you can ignore the words label and really all we see is text that

10:49.610 --> 10:53.960
says your name and the field is required so users have to fill this out.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.670
They can't leave a blank and then we see another bit of code here.

10:57.680 --> 11:04.250
So the word text here tells Wordpress and the web browser to create a text input field where users can

11:04.250 --> 11:08.690
type and then your name is the name of that field.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.730
Let's look at the next chunk of code.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.910
So here we see your e-mail and it's required.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.160
And then the word email right here is telling the plug in and WordPress and the web browser that the

11:19.160 --> 11:26.110
user must enter a valid email address in this field and then your e-mail is the name of that field.

11:26.330 --> 11:31.090
OK and then obviously that same pattern is also applied for the subject field.

11:31.130 --> 11:36.870
And the your message field so hopefully you can agree with me that this code is not rocket science.

11:37.070 --> 11:39.470
But let's get back to the task at hand.

11:39.620 --> 11:45.360
So remember we want to create a brand new field titled What are you interested in.

11:45.500 --> 11:51.770
And the field will be a drop down menu where visitors have to choose between advertising photography

11:51.830 --> 11:53.100
or graphic design.

11:53.350 --> 11:55.600
Ok so if we want to add that new field.

11:55.730 --> 12:01.000
The first step is to place our cursor so click right where we want to add it.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.630
So let's say that I want to add it right after this subject field.

12:04.770 --> 12:07.500
And right before your message field.

12:07.670 --> 12:10.770
So I will just click here to place my cursor right there.

12:11.030 --> 12:18.750
And now I can click any one of these buttons to insert a certain type of field so I can click dropdown

12:18.770 --> 12:27.420
menu and from this pop up screen we're interested in this options field so you can see that it reads

12:27.470 --> 12:29.640
one option per line.

12:29.680 --> 12:38.760
So we want them to be able to choose between photography advertising or graphic design.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.540
But you get the idea you just type out the available options that you want your visitors to be able

12:43.540 --> 12:46.780
to choose from one per line and that's it.

12:46.780 --> 12:54.200
So with those in place now we can click this blue insert tag button down here and the plug in just added

12:54.200 --> 12:56.460
this new line of code for us.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.510
Now with this new line of code in place.

12:58.610 --> 13:04.340
Why don't we click the save button in the top right corner and see what our updated contact form looks

13:04.340 --> 13:06.630
like on the front end of our Web site.

13:06.770 --> 13:15.040
So let me jump to the contact us page and if I scroll down a bit here we see that dropdown menu and

13:15.040 --> 13:18.970
if I click on it I can choose between the three options.

13:18.970 --> 13:23.160
Now I do notice a problem though this field doesn't have a label.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.020
Remember we wanted it to read.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.910
What are you interested in.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.100
So let's add that label right now.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.910
Let's jump back into our admin dashboard.

13:32.110 --> 13:37.430
And now our goal is to add label text for this new field that we created.

13:37.540 --> 13:42.600
We are going to need to write a little tiny bit of code but I don't think it's going to be scary.

13:42.610 --> 13:46.290
So check this out right above this new line that we created.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.960
Let's add a new line.

13:48.010 --> 13:52.260
So place your cursor at the beginning of this line and then push enter.

13:52.280 --> 13:58.270
Create a new line and then just jump up to that new line and enter the less than symbol and then type

13:58.390 --> 14:01.880
label and then type the greater than symbol.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.630
And now we can type whatever we want our label to be.

14:04.750 --> 14:10.750
So in our case let's make it read what are you interested in.

14:10.990 --> 14:12.910
OK and we have one last step.

14:12.910 --> 14:16.170
Now right below this new field line.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.160
So drop down to a new line.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.750
Now I want you to close out the label tag.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.710
So type in the less than symbol and then type a forward slash.

14:25.710 --> 14:26.100
All right.

14:26.110 --> 14:30.820
And then type label and then type a greater than symbol and that's it.

14:30.820 --> 14:34.660
Congratulations you just wrote a bit of HTL mail code.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.540
Now from this point let's go ahead and save the page again.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.100
So towards the right hand corner click save.

14:41.180 --> 14:49.330
And now if I jump back to my front facing Web site on the Contact page and refresh and scroll down a

14:49.330 --> 14:51.480
bit here's our field.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.810
And now we see what are you interested in.

14:53.950 --> 14:57.830
So now visitors will understand what we are asking them to fill out.

14:58.060 --> 14:58.480
OK.

14:58.480 --> 15:03.640
So we successfully added a field to the front end of this form that visitors fill out.

15:03.820 --> 15:10.720
But we do have one final step if we want to actually see their answer in the email that gets sent to

15:10.720 --> 15:11.530
us.

15:11.530 --> 15:12.350
So check this out.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.830
If we jump back to our admin dashboard.

15:14.940 --> 15:15.280
All right.

15:15.280 --> 15:21.970
And from this edit contact form screen we've previously been working in this area and up here we can

15:21.970 --> 15:24.010
see a few taps to choose from.

15:24.010 --> 15:31.360
So we've been working within the form screen but now we need to click on the mail screen to go ahead

15:31.360 --> 15:33.060
and click mail right here.

15:34.090 --> 15:40.300
This screen will let us customize all of the details about the e-mail that get sent to us as the owner

15:40.300 --> 15:43.880
of the Web site so you can change the To field the from field.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.610
The subject line you get the idea.

15:46.720 --> 15:52.280
In this case what I want to customise is the actual message or the body of the e-mail.

15:52.300 --> 15:56.570
So if I scroll down a bit here we can see message body.

15:56.650 --> 16:02.350
And this is the actual meat and potatoes this is the body of the email that will be sent to us.

16:02.350 --> 16:07.750
Now if you think back to a few moments ago when we were working with the code these bits of code here

16:07.750 --> 16:09.550
will probably seem familiar.

16:09.550 --> 16:12.580
Remember that field where the user types in their name.

16:12.610 --> 16:18.850
Well whatever the user types in is stored in a variable named Jordache name.

16:19.090 --> 16:24.010
And the same thing with their email it's stored in a variable Jordache e-mail.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.970
So we will receive an e-mail that says from Colon.

16:27.010 --> 16:32.620
And then the person's name subject colon and then whatever the user typed in is their subject.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.270
So back to the task at hand.

16:34.450 --> 16:40.300
We want to make sure that this e-mail that gets sent to us includes the field where we ask the user

16:40.300 --> 16:41.830
what they are interested in.

16:42.070 --> 16:43.530
So here's what I'm going to do.

16:43.810 --> 16:49.690
Let's create a new line right about here and say I'm interested in.

16:49.930 --> 16:54.910
And then I need to type out the variable name for that new field that we created.

16:54.910 --> 17:00.090
Now I don't expect you to have superhuman memory so to find out the name of that field.

17:00.130 --> 17:06.370
Let's just scroll up and currently we are in the mail tab but let's jump back to the form tab.

17:07.250 --> 17:13.400
And here's that dropdown field that we created Currently it looks like as a name or variable name of

17:13.680 --> 17:16.650
menue dash 4 6 6.

17:16.670 --> 17:21.650
Now the contact plug in and wordpress automatically generated that name for us.

17:21.650 --> 17:24.950
And it indeed seems like a name that a robot came up with.

17:24.980 --> 17:26.920
It's not a very human friendly name.

17:27.050 --> 17:29.770
So we are free to change that right now if we want to.

17:29.870 --> 17:38.660
So let's delete that menu dash for 6:06 and instead let's type in interested dash in.

17:38.690 --> 17:39.890
Now I just made that up.

17:39.890 --> 17:41.330
I invented this name.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.940
You could type out any name that you want here.

17:43.940 --> 17:46.810
Just make sure that you don't have spaces in your name.

17:46.850 --> 17:49.490
Use dashes instead of spaces.

17:49.670 --> 17:52.460
And now if we jump back to the mail tab.

17:52.460 --> 17:54.720
So click on mail right here.

17:55.340 --> 18:02.480
If I scroll down a bit back in this message body field remember we added interested in Colon and now

18:02.480 --> 18:05.100
we just type out the variable name of that field.

18:05.120 --> 18:10.820
So let's begin with a pair of brackets square brackets for not sure how to get these characters.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.990
I'll tell you right now.

18:12.140 --> 18:19.970
So on your keyboard directly to the right of the key that's the open square bracket and then to the

18:19.970 --> 18:23.060
right of that key is the closing square bracket.

18:23.090 --> 18:26.660
Now in between those brackets let's just type the variable name.

18:26.660 --> 18:32.490
Now you might have named it something different but in my case remember I named that field interested

18:32.870 --> 18:34.680
dash in.

18:34.910 --> 18:35.290
All right.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.920
So this code looks good to me.

18:36.920 --> 18:43.530
Now let's scroll down to the very bottom of this page and click on Save.

18:43.740 --> 18:50.160
And now let's jump back over to the front end of our website and refresh on the Contact Us page.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.330
And if I scroll down.

18:51.420 --> 18:56.900
Let me fill out this form and then I will show you the email in my inbox to prove that everything's

18:56.910 --> 18:58.800
working as we had hoped for.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.700
All right let's go ahead and click send.

19:08.370 --> 19:09.510
Thank you for your message.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.520
It was sent.

19:10.700 --> 19:16.200
And just to prove that things are working as we had hoped for here is that generated e-mail from my

19:16.200 --> 19:17.240
inbox.

19:17.370 --> 19:23.730
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson we will learn how to make

19:23.730 --> 19:26.460
a few improvements to the contact form.

19:26.490 --> 19:33.240
It should be a lot of fun by the end of that lesson we will have a premium 100 percent bulletproof contact

19:33.240 --> 19:33.930
form.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.850
Let's keep rolling.

19:34.860 --> 19:37.730
And I will see you in the next lesson.
