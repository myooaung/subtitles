00:01.000 --> 00:07.930
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about next steps you can take to continue developing your

00:07.930 --> 00:09.530
Wordpress skills.

00:09.640 --> 00:14.410
Because while we have come to the end of this course I don't want to leave you hanging.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.640
I want to give you clear paths forward to continue growing.

00:18.640 --> 00:22.510
First let's review what we've learned so far in the course.

00:22.510 --> 00:27.260
We learned how to use Wordpress to create as many pages as we would like.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.710
We learned how to create as many blog posts and blog categories as we would like.

00:32.710 --> 00:39.360
We learned how to create a photo gallery and we learned how to create an interactive contact page.

00:39.370 --> 00:42.390
Now those are the building blocks for most web sites.

00:42.490 --> 00:44.730
But sometimes you'll want to do more.

00:44.770 --> 00:50.080
Now there is an infinite number of different things you might want to do with your website so I can't

00:50.080 --> 00:57.130
possibly prepare you for every scenario but what I can do is let you know the steps that I take personally

00:57.340 --> 01:03.130
when I want to do something new or custom or unique with my wordpress websites.

01:03.130 --> 01:09.310
So here are the steps and or topics that we will review throughout the remainder of this lesson.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.940
We will go through these one by one in detail.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.090
And let's start at the top with googling.

01:15.280 --> 01:21.860
OK so the first thing I want to stress here is that the Wordpress community is absolutely huge.

01:21.940 --> 01:27.100
About 27 percent of the entire web runs on wordpress.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.080
So this means whenever we want to do something with wordpress.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.810
But we aren't sure how to do it.

01:31.810 --> 01:37.750
Chances are someone on the Internet has already asked the same question we have and they've already

01:37.750 --> 01:39.940
received an amazing answer.

01:39.940 --> 01:46.890
So whenever I need to do something with wordpress but I don't know how to I just google for wordpress.

01:47.020 --> 01:51.790
How do I blank where blank is obviously whatever you're trying to achieve.

01:51.790 --> 01:57.010
Now I know Googling and clicking on random search results can be stressful because you don't know which

01:57.010 --> 01:58.850
Web sites are safe to visit.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.580
So here's a list of my favorite Web sites.

02:01.660 --> 02:07.900
If you see any of these domains in your Google search results I'd recommend clicking on them right away.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.530
Kodak's dot WordPress dot org.

02:10.540 --> 02:13.900
This is the official WordPress documentation Web site.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.950
Stack Overflow.

02:15.950 --> 02:24.490
WordPress dot stack exchange dot com YouTube dot com WordPress dot org slash support.

02:24.700 --> 02:32.950
That's the official WordPress message board form CSSA trick's dot com and W.P. beginner dot com.

02:33.010 --> 02:33.970
Now by all means.

02:33.970 --> 02:38.170
I'm not saying that if a Web site isn't on this list you shouldn't visit it.

02:38.290 --> 02:39.730
I'm not saying that at all.

02:39.880 --> 02:46.060
These are simply Web sites that have great reputations are safe and that I've had positive experiences

02:46.060 --> 02:46.760
with.

02:46.810 --> 02:51.670
OK so that's the first thing I wanted to cover in this lesson which is simply never underestimate the

02:51.670 --> 02:52.960
power of Google.

02:52.960 --> 02:58.300
There's a running joke that web developers basically make a living for Googling all day and there's

02:58.300 --> 03:00.360
definitely some truth to that joke.

03:00.550 --> 03:05.110
So at this point now that we've worked through this course together and you have a general understanding

03:05.110 --> 03:10.720
of the Wordpress vocabulary and how the puzzle pieces fit together now the world is yours.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.480
All this information is at your fingertips and with your new WordPress vocabulary I think you'll understand

03:16.480 --> 03:18.790
more of it than you give yourself credit for.

03:18.790 --> 03:25.150
All right let's move on to the next topic which is free plug ins versus premium plug ins.

03:25.270 --> 03:31.090
Let me begin by saying that throughout this entire course all of the plugins that we've used have been

03:31.090 --> 03:32.590
free plug ins.

03:32.740 --> 03:38.050
So from the admin dashboard within the left hand side bar when we click on plug ins.

03:38.170 --> 03:43.990
And then we click on Add new this collection of thousands of plug ins that we can search through.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.420
These are all free plug ins.

03:46.420 --> 03:54.130
There is however a whole other separate world of premium plug ins a premium plug in costs money but

03:54.130 --> 03:57.730
offers more advanced features than a free plug in might have.

03:57.760 --> 04:03.640
Now if I just said that all the plug ins we see on this screen are free you might be wondering where

04:03.640 --> 04:05.770
can we find the premium plug ins.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.800
Well there is not a single unified list of all premium plugins.

04:10.810 --> 04:15.280
Instead they are scattered throughout the web each with their own Web site.

04:15.490 --> 04:21.580
You purchase a premium plug in through an external third party website and once your purchase order

04:21.580 --> 04:25.950
is complete you'll be given a zip file which contains the plug in.

04:26.140 --> 04:31.810
You say that zip file to your computer and then back in your Wordpress admin dashboard.

04:31.810 --> 04:36.970
If you click on plug ins in the left hand side bar and then click on Add new.

04:37.180 --> 04:40.480
Now you can leverage this upload plugin button.

04:40.660 --> 04:46.420
So when you click on that button then you simply select the zip file that you were given from the publisher

04:46.420 --> 04:48.760
of the premium plug in that you purchased.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.530
Now I do want to bring something to your attention before you go out and start purchasing any premium

04:53.530 --> 04:54.620
plug ins.

04:54.640 --> 04:59.950
So with free plug ins all of the plug ins that we can search through through the Wordpress admin dashboard

05:00.300 --> 05:06.720
amongst those thousands of free plug ins we can rest assured that the Wordpress team has reviewed and

05:06.720 --> 05:08.720
approved each plug in.

05:08.730 --> 05:14.250
This means that the free plug ins have been reviewed and scanned and they are indeed safe and don't

05:14.250 --> 05:21.540
contain any malicious code that could display Secret ads on our website or steal our passwords or anything

05:21.540 --> 05:23.050
else evil like that.

05:23.100 --> 05:29.490
We do not get that same peace of mind with premium plug ins since each premium plug in lives on its

05:29.490 --> 05:31.120
own third party Web site.

05:31.260 --> 05:37.740
It's up to us to do our own research and determine if the publisher of a premium plug in is reputable

05:37.800 --> 05:38.970
and trustworthy.

05:38.970 --> 05:45.990
So off the top of my head I know that Pippin's plugins and elegant themes are two examples of reputable

05:45.990 --> 05:48.940
trustworthy premium plugin creators.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.830
I'm not affiliated with them.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.970
They're just well-known and have great reputations.

05:53.970 --> 05:59.220
Now there are countless other trustworthy premium plugin creators but you get my point.

05:59.340 --> 06:04.890
It's a matter of word of mouth and searching for reviews of plugins and companies on Google.

06:04.890 --> 06:11.820
So long story short I would always begin by searching for a free plug in and only if you cannot find

06:11.820 --> 06:14.170
a free plug in to do what you need to do.

06:14.220 --> 06:19.260
Only at that point would I venture into the premium plug in market and then before you reach for your

06:19.260 --> 06:21.560
credit card to buy the premium plug in.

06:21.630 --> 06:26.310
First make sure that the company you're buying from is reputable and trustworthy.

06:26.310 --> 06:31.550
Usually a quick Google search for is blank legit will do the trick.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.100
OK not changing gears next.

06:34.110 --> 06:38.970
Let's talk about free themes vs premium themes.

06:38.970 --> 06:45.050
Now this is basically the exact same situation as free plug ins versus premium plug ins.

06:45.180 --> 06:47.790
So I'm not going to repeat literally everything.

06:47.880 --> 06:54.780
However if we go into our admin dashboard and click on appearance in the left hand sidebar and then

06:54.780 --> 06:57.540
click add new to add a new theme.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.280
All of these themes that we can search through from within our WordPress admin area.

07:02.310 --> 07:08.620
These are all free themes but there's a whole other world out there of premium themes.

07:08.670 --> 07:14.430
So just like with plugins I recommend searching through the free themes but if you can't find a free

07:14.430 --> 07:19.340
theme that you like then it might be time to venture into the premium the market.

07:19.350 --> 07:25.110
So just like premium plugins premium themes live on third party websites.

07:25.170 --> 07:29.730
So once you find a premium theme that you like and you complete your purchase order again they will

07:29.730 --> 07:35.490
give you a zip file which contains the theme and then back in your admin dashboard if you just click

07:35.490 --> 07:38.170
on appearance and then add new.

07:38.190 --> 07:45.490
Now you can leverage the upload theme button and just select the zip file of the theme that you purchased.

07:45.510 --> 07:49.650
OK so at this point so far we've talked about Google researching.

07:49.650 --> 07:56.640
When it comes to WordPress we've discussed premium plugins and premium themes and with just those three

07:56.640 --> 08:03.210
tools a lot of people are able to create a job or business or career for themselves of creating WordPress

08:03.210 --> 08:05.250
Web sites for clients.

08:05.250 --> 08:12.150
There is however another way to create even more unique or custom solutions with wordpress.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.190
And that is to create your own theme.

08:15.380 --> 08:21.090
So if you don't love any of the themes you've looked at whether they are free or premium and you want

08:21.090 --> 08:28.870
100 percent control over the way things look your best bet is to simply create your own new theme yourself.

08:29.070 --> 08:33.200
Now creating a theme does require you to learn how to write code.

08:33.300 --> 08:39.650
So this option is not for everyone but I can say that it's not nearly as scary as it might sound.

08:39.660 --> 08:46.290
Now if this route of coding and creating your own themes sounds interesting to you here's the path that

08:46.290 --> 08:47.470
I would recommend.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.550
So first before worrying specifically about WordPress themes.

08:52.680 --> 09:00.840
Begin by learning the basics of two computer languages named HTL and CSX.

09:00.930 --> 09:07.230
These two languages have nothing to do with wordpress specifically but instead these are the two languages

09:07.230 --> 09:11.370
that every Web site on the planet is created from.

09:11.370 --> 09:15.500
There are tons of excellent guides on the Internet to help you learn.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.960
H T M L in C Ss.

09:17.970 --> 09:26.340
Now once you're comfortable with H TMLC SS then you can look for a guide to WordPress theme files and

09:26.340 --> 09:28.820
a language named ph p.

09:28.920 --> 09:34.050
I know those last couple of sentences might have sounded like meaningless technobabble.

09:34.170 --> 09:37.070
And again the coding path is not for everyone.

09:37.140 --> 09:42.810
So don't feel like you need to follow it but if it's something that you are at all interested in I really

09:42.810 --> 09:48.480
encourage you to give it a go because I've taught coding to countless people and one of the most common

09:48.480 --> 09:51.990
things I hear back is hey this is really difficult.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.140
But it's not as bad as I thought it would be.

09:54.150 --> 10:00.300
Anyways long story short you don't need to be a genius to get into code and on the other hand or do

10:00.300 --> 10:04.840
you need the code to be an insanely successful WordPress creator.

10:05.070 --> 10:09.870
So the choice is yours follow the path that sounds the most interesting to you.

10:10.050 --> 10:10.560
OK.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.940
And that's going to bring things to a close.

10:13.080 --> 10:19.470
I encourage you to keep experimenting keep building new things and most importantly take advantage of

10:19.470 --> 10:26.360
the Course's discussion features to ask myself and your fellow students any questions you might have.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.480
Wordpress is all about community.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.890
So let's continue to share our best tips and tricks and resources with each other.

10:32.910 --> 10:35.650
I want to thank you for coming along on this journey.

10:35.760 --> 10:41.870
We all speak the same basic WordPress vocabulary now and I'm excited to see what you create with it.

10:41.940 --> 10:47.760
Remember to have fun during the process and maybe help a friend or family member get started themselves

10:47.970 --> 10:53.520
because a lot of people would love to create Web sites but they don't know where to begin and you teaching

10:53.520 --> 10:57.780
them Wordpress is one of the best ways for you to keep learning yourself.

10:57.780 --> 11:00.650
Anyways take care and I'll see you around.
