00:00.880 --> 00:06.340
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about sub pages.

00:06.370 --> 00:11.260
Let's begin by asking the question what is a subpage.

00:11.260 --> 00:17.380
All right so here we see the home page of my public Web site and if I use the navigation to visit my

00:17.380 --> 00:23.440
About Us page here we see the page that I was working on in the previous lesson.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.500
And now in this lesson.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.390
Let's imagine.

00:26.420 --> 00:35.240
I want to add another couple of new pages that belong to the About Us page or that are highly related

00:35.240 --> 00:37.230
to the About Us page.

00:37.250 --> 00:44.420
So for example in this lesson maybe I want to create a new page named our history and maybe I want to

00:44.420 --> 00:48.210
create another new page named how we work.

00:48.530 --> 00:56.780
So in that case the About Us page would be the parent page and then our history would be its child and

00:56.780 --> 01:02.050
how we work would also be a child page that belongs to about us.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.550
Okay that's enough talking.

01:04.550 --> 01:09.080
Now let's get our hands dirty and actually try to create a sub page.

01:09.170 --> 01:13.870
So I will use this link to navigate to my admin dashboard area.

01:14.150 --> 01:15.820
I want to create a new page.

01:15.830 --> 01:21.910
So in the sidebar I will look for pages and then click add new.

01:22.080 --> 01:28.290
I will give this new page a title of our history for the content.

01:28.290 --> 01:32.590
I will just paste in a bit of Lorem some filler dummy content.

01:32.940 --> 01:35.270
And now here is the important part.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.670
Over on the right hand side of the page.

01:37.770 --> 01:41.080
Notice this page attributes box.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.780
The first option we see here is named parent.

01:44.790 --> 01:51.900
If I click on this field I can choose between any of my currently existing pages so I will choose about

01:51.990 --> 02:00.120
us and that's my way of telling WordPress that this brand new Our history page should be considered

02:00.120 --> 02:03.380
the child of the About Us page right.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.690
The About Us page is the parent page.

02:06.780 --> 02:10.860
All right so let's go ahead and click the blue publish button.

02:11.060 --> 02:18.850
And now if we look within our main lefthand menu and click on pages again this screen will always show

02:18.850 --> 02:21.760
us a list of all of our pages.

02:21.760 --> 02:28.300
Notice that the new page that we just created our history has these two dashes in front of it and it's

02:28.300 --> 02:31.330
listed right underneath the About Us page.

02:31.330 --> 02:36.640
WordPress does this so that when we look at a list of all of our pages we can immediately tell which

02:36.640 --> 02:39.670
pages belong to other pages.

02:39.940 --> 02:46.600
So the dashes create a bit of indentation which implies that this page is kind of nested within this

02:46.600 --> 02:50.700
page or that this page belongs to this page.

02:51.040 --> 02:58.350
OK now at this point why don't we jump back to our public facing web site and navigate to our About

02:58.350 --> 03:00.540
Us page.

03:00.760 --> 03:05.950
And I want to point out that currently this page does not include a link to the new.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.110
Our history page.

03:08.110 --> 03:11.140
Now remember every theme is different.

03:11.140 --> 03:17.500
Some themes do indeed show links to all of the children pages when you are viewing a parent page but

03:17.500 --> 03:19.190
a lot of themes do not.

03:19.360 --> 03:26.760
So for example I'm using the 2016 theme and it doesn't automatically list the children links anywhere.

03:26.770 --> 03:31.170
So in this case it's up to us to create that link manually.

03:31.180 --> 03:34.750
So for the remainder of this lesson we have two main goals.

03:35.020 --> 03:40.960
Goal number one will be to add a link in our main navigation menu so that when you hover over about

03:40.960 --> 03:47.680
us a little dropdown menu appears right about here with links to any of the child pages that belong

03:47.680 --> 03:49.170
to about us.

03:49.510 --> 03:55.750
OK so that's goal number one and then Goal number two is to learn how to create links within the main

03:55.750 --> 03:58.510
paragraphs of content on a page.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.960
OK let's start with the main navigation menu golpe.

04:02.020 --> 04:08.680
So I'm going to jump back to my admin dashboard and in the left hand menu I will look for appearance

04:09.430 --> 04:12.260
and then I'm interested in menus.

04:12.850 --> 04:18.230
OK so here we can see where a menu it currently consists of these three links.

04:18.370 --> 04:23.430
And over here we can see a list of all available pages on our Web site.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.630
So here we see the brand new Our history page.

04:26.650 --> 04:35.200
So I will just check that and then click add to menu all right only I don't want my our history page

04:35.800 --> 04:43.270
to be treated like a major top level link like these three pages I want our history to be nested within

04:43.270 --> 04:44.530
about us.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.660
So it's as easy as just clicking and dragging our history to be right about here.

04:49.870 --> 04:54.370
And then just drag a little bit to the right and wordpress will know what you're trying to do.

04:55.390 --> 05:02.490
And that little bit of indentation here implies that this page belongs to this page.

05:02.530 --> 05:05.850
All right so let's go ahead and click the blue save menu button.

05:06.900 --> 05:12.480
And if I use this link in the top left corner to switch back to the public Web site within our main

05:12.480 --> 05:16.020
navigation we can now see this little downward facing arrow.

05:16.200 --> 05:20.740
And if I hover over about us we see our history.

05:20.790 --> 05:21.510
Perfect.

05:21.540 --> 05:25.950
So I can click that to visit that page and practice makes perfect.

05:25.980 --> 05:33.420
So why don't we create another new page named how we work and also set it to be a child page of about

05:33.420 --> 05:34.710
us.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.970
So let's jump back to our admin area.

05:38.690 --> 05:44.300
Under pages Let's click add new for the title.

05:44.310 --> 05:48.300
I will say how we work for the content.

05:48.330 --> 05:54.180
I'll just paste in a bit of dummy filler text and over here within the right hand column.

05:54.360 --> 06:00.220
Even though the current theme we're using doesn't really make use of the parent child relationship.

06:00.240 --> 06:07.450
I still want to let WordPress know that I consider this page to be a child of about us because it will

06:07.450 --> 06:13.690
help me stay organized when I view a list of all pages in the admin area and if we ever switched to

06:13.690 --> 06:20.110
a new theme in the future maybe that theme will make use of the parent child relationship out of the

06:20.110 --> 06:21.020
box.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.980
OK so let's publish this new page.

06:24.070 --> 06:29.080
Now if I switched over to the public Web site we wouldn't see a link to this new page anywhere.

06:29.290 --> 06:35.240
So now let's manually add a link to this new page in our main navigation menu.

06:35.320 --> 06:40.230
So over on the left hand side bar under appearance let's click on menus.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.910
Again here's a list of all of our pages.

06:45.150 --> 06:47.400
Here's the new how we work that we just created.

06:47.400 --> 06:54.350
So let's check that and then click add to menu and then I'm just going to click and drag this new page

06:54.530 --> 06:57.490
so that it lives under about us.

06:58.460 --> 06:58.850
Perfect.

06:58.850 --> 07:03.530
So that little bit of indentation implies that it belongs to about us.

07:03.650 --> 07:08.650
Let's say this menu and jump back to our public facing Web site.

07:08.990 --> 07:15.220
So now I can click on about us and if I hover over about us we have our two child pages.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.270
OK.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.050
So that takes care of the navigation menu.

07:19.340 --> 07:25.880
Let's change gears now and work on our final goal for this lesson and that is learning how to add links

07:25.880 --> 07:31.600
to other pages within the main paragraph text or content of a page.

07:31.610 --> 07:38.500
So for example maybe on this main About Us page let's imagine I want to add a new paragraph down here

07:38.990 --> 07:45.440
and within that paragraph I want to have links to each of the new child pages and also maybe a link

07:45.470 --> 07:47.840
to the Contact Us page.

07:47.870 --> 07:53.330
So if I want to edit the page that I'm currently viewing up in the top bar I can just make use of this

07:53.420 --> 07:54.840
edit page button.

07:56.770 --> 08:02.560
OK within this main content field but scroll down to the very bottom I'll place my cursor at the end

08:02.560 --> 08:11.180
of the text and then hit enter to get to a new line and I will say our company is very interesting.

08:11.590 --> 08:20.240
You can learn about our history and you can also learn more about how we work.

08:20.350 --> 08:23.560
If you would like to work with us.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.500
Be sure to visit our contact page.

08:28.810 --> 08:29.160
OK.

08:29.170 --> 08:34.640
Now watch how easy it is to create links out of certain phrases within this paragraph.

08:34.690 --> 08:38.130
So within this sentence you can learn more about our history.

08:38.320 --> 08:43.290
I want our in history to be a link to the our history page.

08:43.330 --> 08:53.900
So I just highlight that little bit of text and then up in this menu look for this icon when I hover

08:53.900 --> 08:57.360
over this icon it says insert or edit link.

08:57.410 --> 09:05.980
So if I click that then down here this new menu appears and it says paste you Arel or type to search.

09:06.050 --> 09:11.780
So what Wordpress is doing here is it's asking us where do you want visitors to be taken when they click

09:11.780 --> 09:12.960
this link.

09:12.980 --> 09:17.650
Now I'm not a robot so I haven't memorized the you are Elle's of all of my pages.

09:17.780 --> 09:20.180
So that's why WordPress will let me search here.

09:20.390 --> 09:27.200
So if I just begin searching for my our history page as I begin typing that WordPress tries to guess

09:27.200 --> 09:28.560
what I'm looking for.

09:28.640 --> 09:36.110
And you can see here it guessed correctly so I will just click on our history and then it fills in the

09:36.110 --> 09:37.760
U R L to that page.

09:37.760 --> 09:42.800
So now I can just click this blue button and we successfully created a link.

09:42.800 --> 09:47.390
So now I can just click anywhere else on the page to make this menu disappear.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.040
And practice makes perfect.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.150
So let's do the same thing for how we work.

09:52.190 --> 09:59.750
So I highlight those words that I want to turn into a link and then up in this menu I use this icon.

10:00.230 --> 10:06.320
Now down within this menu I just start typing for the page I'm looking for so how and wordpress.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.480
Note that this is probably what I'm looking for.

10:08.480 --> 10:13.890
So just click on that then click this blue apply icon OK.

10:13.910 --> 10:19.610
And finally I want to illustrate that it's not like you can only link to children pages.

10:19.790 --> 10:26.870
You can link to any page and you can even link to other web sites so we could link to Google or Facebook.

10:26.900 --> 10:33.200
You get the idea but the point is we can definitely link to our contact page even though the contact

10:33.200 --> 10:36.650
page doesn't have anything to do with the About Us page.

10:36.710 --> 10:44.600
So let me select Contact page and with that highlighted use this icon to pull up this menu and begin

10:44.600 --> 10:45.140
typing.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.240
Contact us.

10:47.240 --> 10:53.750
This is the result I want so I click on that click the blue apply button and we're in business so I'm

10:53.750 --> 10:55.060
happy with these changes.

10:55.070 --> 11:00.590
I will use the blue update button in the right and call them up.

11:00.590 --> 11:06.590
Here we see this page was successfully created message and I can use that view page linked to go directly

11:06.590 --> 11:15.560
to that page about us and if we scroll down here we see that new paragraph let's test out the links.

11:15.560 --> 11:24.050
So I would click on our history works perfectly if I go back to about us I can test out how we work.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.700
That link works as well.

11:25.760 --> 11:32.300
If I go back to about us and test out the contact page link that works as well.

11:32.400 --> 11:38.680
And in addition to those paragraphed links we still have our trusty main navigation dropdown menu.

11:39.380 --> 11:43.290
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

11:43.340 --> 11:49.910
I encourage you to experiment by creating your own new pages setting them up with the parent child relationship

11:50.000 --> 11:54.110
and then creating your own dropdown menus within the admin.

11:54.110 --> 12:00.320
Appearance menu screen practicing constantly experimenting is really the best way to really let this

12:00.320 --> 12:02.110
material sink in.

12:02.120 --> 12:02.460
OK.

12:02.480 --> 12:09.830
Now in our next lesson we will learn how to create a photo gallery page with a nice grid of thumbnail

12:09.830 --> 12:15.160
images and when you click on one you'll be able to view the larger version of the photograph.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.650
It should be a lot of fun.

12:16.670 --> 12:20.580
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
