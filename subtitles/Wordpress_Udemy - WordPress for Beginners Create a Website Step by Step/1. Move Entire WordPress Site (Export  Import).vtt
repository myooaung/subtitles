Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn how to move our WordPress website to be more specific.

00:09.060 --> 00:16.320
We will learn how to move our website from one domain to another or from one hosting company to another

00:16.710 --> 00:23.160
because oftentimes you will build and create your Wordpress Web site at one location that is more private

00:23.400 --> 00:25.720
and that the general public doesn't know about.

00:25.890 --> 00:31.290
And then once you've completed building the web site then you'll want to move it to another location

00:31.500 --> 00:34.680
like your real dot com domain for example.

00:34.680 --> 00:40.740
Now if you've never moved a Web site before it might sound like a really intimidating task where a really

00:40.740 --> 00:42.490
complicated task.

00:42.510 --> 00:48.140
However if we use the right tool for the job moving a Web site is super easy.

00:48.270 --> 00:54.850
So right now let me walk you through the steps I would take if I wanted to move my wordpress Web site.

00:55.050 --> 00:55.530
OK.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.040
So here's my web site.

00:57.180 --> 01:04.110
And remember towards the beginning of the course I used a site ground as my web host and used the free

01:04.110 --> 01:08.820
three month student hosting plan which comes with this placeholder domain.

01:08.940 --> 01:14.520
And let's imagine that at this point I'm happy with my web site and I want to begin using my own real

01:14.520 --> 01:17.350
unique dot com domain instead.

01:17.490 --> 01:25.830
So for example instead of Bradd as one dot site Ground edu site maybe I want Brad's amazing WordPress

01:25.830 --> 01:30.250
dot com or Brad shares the best recipe's dot com.

01:30.450 --> 01:31.720
You get the idea.

01:31.740 --> 01:38.060
So what you want to do is log into the user account area of whichever web host company you're using.

01:38.220 --> 01:44.790
So in my case I'm using site ground but you might be using Balue hoster or dream post or host gator

01:45.000 --> 01:46.400
or any other web host.

01:46.530 --> 01:50.720
But the point here is let's go ahead and sign into the User Account area.

01:50.730 --> 01:56.520
So if you're like me and you're using site ground let's just use this top right log in button.

01:56.910 --> 01:59.060
Every web host company is different.

01:59.190 --> 02:05.670
So there's no way for me to predict exactly what your screen will look like but the same general concepts

02:05.730 --> 02:07.020
should apply here.

02:07.020 --> 02:12.570
So if we want our own custom dot com domain that's going to cost us a bit of money.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.820
And that's true regardless of which web host we're using.

02:15.930 --> 02:21.750
Now if you're like me and you were using a free trial account up until this point you have two options

02:21.750 --> 02:22.590
forward.

02:22.590 --> 02:29.440
Option one is to renew or upgrade your free account in your free Web site into a paid premium account.

02:29.640 --> 02:36.640
And option number two is to just create a brand new website and a brand new hosting account all together.

02:36.720 --> 02:41.520
Now when it comes to choosing between option one and two I would always just choose whichever one is

02:41.520 --> 02:43.830
the better deal or the better price.

02:43.980 --> 02:49.860
So within site ground if you want to renew or upgrade your existing web site you would just click on

02:49.860 --> 02:52.040
my accounts up at the top here.

02:52.290 --> 02:56.860
Here's the hosting account for the test domain that I've been using throughout this course.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.820
So Option 1 would be to click renew or upgrade here.

03:00.840 --> 03:07.230
However at this moment as I'm recording this lesson the better deal to be had is if we click this add

03:07.230 --> 03:09.350
services link in the top here.

03:11.250 --> 03:16.760
And instead of renewing our free account it's a better deal if we just create a new account entirely.

03:16.920 --> 03:23.610
So again from this ad services page we can use this most affordable plan so we can click this order

03:23.610 --> 03:26.190
now button.

03:26.190 --> 03:30.720
Then you would just scroll down and finish filling out the form and then wait a few minutes for your

03:30.720 --> 03:33.940
hosting company to send you a confirmation email.

03:34.140 --> 03:40.470
Then within your new hosting account you'll want to install WordPress most hosting companies will make

03:40.470 --> 03:42.130
that very simple to do.

03:42.270 --> 03:47.580
They will likely ask you what software you want to work with and you just choose WordPress.

03:47.760 --> 03:54.550
OK so then that new WordPress empty canvas Web site will live at your real dot com domain.

03:54.810 --> 03:58.610
So as an example here's a brand new copy of wordpress.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.830
If we look in the address bar we can see that.

04:00.830 --> 04:07.800
No I did not just buy Brad's amazing site dot com but we can pretend we can imagine that this is the

04:07.800 --> 04:10.520
new domain I want to use going forward.

04:10.560 --> 04:18.830
Right so if I jump back to my old WordPress Web site remember it was Brad s one dot as GED site.

04:18.840 --> 04:26.790
So this new empty copy of Wordpress is Brad esque to SAGD you and at the moment this brand new WordPress

04:26.790 --> 04:29.370
Web site is an empty canvas.

04:29.370 --> 04:37.080
So if I jump into my admin area click on pages we can see that it doesn't contain any pages and if I

04:37.080 --> 04:43.600
click on posts it only contains the two starter posts that WordPress creates for us.

04:43.620 --> 04:50.970
So the question becomes how can I efficiently move over all of this content from my old original WordPress

04:50.970 --> 04:51.920
Web site.

04:51.930 --> 04:58.020
How can I move over all of my pages and recipes and travel blog posts and photographs.

04:58.020 --> 05:06.000
How can I move over all of that content into this new WordPress instance in a quick and painless fashion.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.940
Right because it wouldn't be any fun to recreate a Web site click by click again.

05:11.010 --> 05:17.190
We don't want to have to recreate each page and post and reset each setting and upload each photo again

05:17.190 --> 05:18.220
one by one.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.860
That would take forever.

05:19.950 --> 05:24.600
So luckily there is a much quicker way to do it and I will show you that way right now.

05:24.600 --> 05:30.720
So jump back to your original website that you've been working on throughout this course and let's jump

05:30.720 --> 05:37.440
into the admin dashboard area and within the left hand side bar click on plugins.

05:38.270 --> 05:43.320
We want to install a new plug so go ahead and click add new.

05:43.490 --> 05:44.020
All right.

05:44.030 --> 05:49.930
And from this screen lets use this top right field to search for a plugin and we are looking for.

05:50.180 --> 05:55.710
All in one migration.

05:55.850 --> 06:03.260
So here it is the first result it has over 400000 active installs and I can tell you from real experience

06:03.260 --> 06:05.540
that this plugin is amazing.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.230
So let's go ahead and click Install now.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.780
Once that completes.

06:11.790 --> 06:20.470
Then click activate and now we will notice a new option in our Sidebar towards the bottom named all

06:20.470 --> 06:22.680
in one WordPress migration.

06:22.930 --> 06:24.830
So go ahead and click on that.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.360
We see the title of this screen is export site.

06:28.450 --> 06:29.230
Perfect.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.490
Let's go ahead and use this menu down here that reads.

06:32.590 --> 06:38.220
Export to and if we click on it let's use the file option.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.270
So export to file

06:44.070 --> 06:47.040
and then go ahead and click on this download link.

06:47.040 --> 06:52.320
Now depending on the speed of your internet connection and also how many photos you uploaded to your

06:52.320 --> 06:59.160
WordPress website this could take anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 minutes.

06:59.360 --> 07:05.330
But once your download finishes you can go ahead and click the close button here and then look within

07:05.330 --> 07:10.820
your computer's downloads folder or wherever you just saved that downloaded file to.

07:10.940 --> 07:16.640
So in my case I will go into the downloads folder and here's the file that I just downloaded.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.140
OK perfect.

07:18.140 --> 07:23.740
So now all I need to do is import this file within my new WordPress Web site.

07:23.990 --> 07:26.200
So over in this other web browser.

07:26.290 --> 07:29.120
Here is my brand new WordPress project.

07:29.150 --> 07:34.640
Remember this is the one where currently if I go into the dashboard and click on pages it doesn't have

07:34.640 --> 07:38.780
a single page because this is a brand new empty word press canvas.

07:38.930 --> 07:45.680
OK so right now what we want to do is import that content that we just exported from the old web site.

07:45.890 --> 07:49.930
So within your new WordPress lets navigate to the plug in screen.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.910
So click on plugins from the left hand side bar.

07:52.970 --> 07:56.750
We want to install that same all in one migration plugin.

07:56.870 --> 08:09.190
So let's click add new from this screen in the top right field that's type all in one migration.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.770
Here it is again the first result.

08:10.790 --> 08:21.750
Let's go ahead and install and then activate and now in the sidebar within this all in one W.P. migration

08:21.750 --> 08:28.680
option if we hover over it instead of export let's click on import.

08:28.770 --> 08:29.230
All right.

08:29.260 --> 08:38.600
And now it's as simple as clicking this import from menu and choosing file so import from file and then

08:38.600 --> 08:44.090
just navigate to your computer's downloads folder or wherever you saved that export and file just a

08:44.090 --> 08:45.000
moment ago.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.010
So here it is.

08:46.010 --> 08:47.550
I will select that file.

08:48.430 --> 08:49.450
And be patient.

08:49.450 --> 08:53.280
Depending on the speed of your internet connection this could take quite a while.

08:56.460 --> 09:02.730
But once it does complete then click this continue button.

09:02.880 --> 09:07.040
And at this point we are 99 percent done on a lot of web hosts.

09:07.050 --> 09:13.470
We will be good to go at this point but if we want to play it safe we can follow this one last bit of

09:13.470 --> 09:14.680
instructions.

09:14.700 --> 09:20.880
So basically we can just click close here and then in our left hand side bar towards the bottom hover

09:20.880 --> 09:26.300
over settings and from the pop up menu click permalink x.

09:26.340 --> 09:30.810
Now we did just import the database from the old WordPress Web site.

09:30.810 --> 09:33.680
So it's common to need to sign in again here.

09:33.840 --> 09:39.630
And it's important to point out here that you will need to use the username and password from your old

09:39.690 --> 09:45.360
original WordPress Web site not the new user name and password that you set up for your new site.

09:45.570 --> 09:51.420
But once you do sign in you'll be taken to this permalink settings screen what you want to do is temporarily

09:51.420 --> 09:59.220
switch to another option and then scroll down and click save changes and then just immediately send

09:59.220 --> 10:05.520
it back to whatever you had it at or whatever setting you prefer and then just click Save changes again.

10:05.670 --> 10:08.730
Again that step is not necessary on all web hosts.

10:08.730 --> 10:14.060
So really I wouldn't even bother with that unless your web site is acting funny after the import.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.790
But on some web hosts it is necessary.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.750
And really all that it's doing is regenerating your Permalink.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.550
But yeah after that we should be good to go.

10:23.550 --> 10:29.850
So now if I jump over to the front facing website for this brand new WordPress site perfect we can see

10:29.850 --> 10:34.020
that all of my content was successfully imported and copied over.

10:34.020 --> 10:35.670
So check out the address bar.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.480
This is the brand new Brad s.

10:38.730 --> 10:43.890
And I can go ahead and use these links to jump to the photo gallery page.

10:43.890 --> 10:51.800
So I'm still on the Brad asked to site I can click on one of these thumbnails perfect so you can see

10:51.800 --> 10:54.920
that that plug in makes it very simple to move.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.970
WordPress sites from one location to another.

10:58.190 --> 11:03.170
Now at this point the core of my new WordPress Web site is running perfectly.

11:03.350 --> 11:06.250
But before we bring this lesson to a close.

11:06.380 --> 11:10.810
Let's not forget about any third party services that we are relying on.

11:10.820 --> 11:18.590
So for example if I click onto the Contact Us page remember to prevent spam bots from filling out our

11:18.590 --> 11:19.910
contact form.

11:19.910 --> 11:24.080
We are relying on the service named recaptcha.

11:24.080 --> 11:31.190
Remember a few lessons ago when we first set up recaptcha we had to generate secret API keys that were

11:31.220 --> 11:34.220
tied to the domain name we were using.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.490
So in this case because my new web site is.

11:36.500 --> 11:42.360
Brad asked to instead of Bradt as one the recapture API keys are outdated.

11:42.560 --> 11:48.130
So all I need to do to fix this is log in to the recaptures service.

11:48.240 --> 11:54.060
So in a web browser where you are signed into your Google account just perform a Google search for Google

11:54.060 --> 12:02.320
recaptcha from the screen I will click get recaptcha OK from this screen you will see a list here of

12:02.410 --> 12:05.490
all the Web sites where you are using recaptcha.

12:05.530 --> 12:13.900
I just have the one so let me click on it and now if I scroll down to this key settings area all I need

12:13.900 --> 12:21.010
to do is update this domain's field so I can either add my new domain on a new line or if you're not

12:21.010 --> 12:26.090
going to be using your old site anymore you can just remove that and replace it with your new domain.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.910
So I could just change this to a 2 but I want my old web site to keep working for just a while longer.

12:32.020 --> 12:37.050
So on a new line I'll just say Brad asked to actually let us site.

12:37.050 --> 12:37.420
All right.

12:37.420 --> 12:42.970
But you would use whatever your new domain name is k and then down here in the bottom right click save

12:42.970 --> 12:49.040
changes now it might take five seconds or it might take five minutes.

12:49.130 --> 12:54.800
But if we jump back to our brand new WordPress Web site and refresh the contact page

12:58.780 --> 12:59.350
perfect.

12:59.380 --> 13:03.590
So now the recap Sheffield is working on our brand new Web site.

13:03.850 --> 13:04.110
OK.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.560
So that takes care of the recaptures service.

13:06.670 --> 13:12.010
But we were also using the discuss service to handle our Web sites comments.

13:12.010 --> 13:15.540
So let's go ahead and tell discuss about our new domain as well.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.960
So if you visit discuss dot com and then sign in with your account.

13:20.080 --> 13:27.610
Once you navigate to this admin screen for your web site then let's click this edit settings button.

13:27.670 --> 13:28.060
All right.

13:28.060 --> 13:33.820
And from the screen let's look at this Web site you are ballfield right below this field we see a bit

13:33.820 --> 13:36.950
of text that reads changing domains.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.320
Learn how.

13:38.320 --> 13:44.630
So let's click on that and then let's use this domain migration tool.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.260
So let's click here.

13:46.470 --> 13:49.330
Then look for the next step button click that.

13:49.530 --> 13:49.890
OK.

13:49.890 --> 13:52.560
And now within this small field right here.

13:52.710 --> 13:56.960
Just go ahead and update this from your old domain to your new domain.

13:57.210 --> 14:01.320
So in my case all I need to do is update this one to two.

14:01.590 --> 14:09.230
But in your case you would enter your new dot com domain and then click nextstep and then click this

14:09.230 --> 14:10.950
confirm migration button.

14:11.060 --> 14:15.750
Ok and now this screen does warn you that it might take up to 24 hours to complete.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.640
But in my experience it updates almost immediately.

14:19.730 --> 14:28.390
So if I jump back to my brand new WordPress Web site and click on travel and then click on trip to the

14:28.390 --> 14:36.380
Midwest I scroll down to the comments area here we can see that example comment that I left several

14:36.380 --> 14:37.420
lessons ago.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.540
OK so perfect.

14:38.540 --> 14:43.310
That means the disgust plug in is working on our new WordPress Web site.

14:43.670 --> 14:49.970
And obviously if you are using any other third party services that rely on your domain you might need

14:49.970 --> 14:54.580
to perform similar steps and either update a setting or regenerate a key.

14:54.650 --> 14:57.780
Like I just did for recaptcha and discuss.

14:57.890 --> 15:03.390
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a clubs in our next lesson.

15:03.410 --> 15:09.720
We will look at a few next steps we can take to continue developing our WordPress skills.

15:09.790 --> 15:11.440
It should be a lot of fun.

15:11.570 --> 15:15.440
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
