00:00.980 --> 00:07.280
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn how to create a custom home page.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.770
Let's dive right into the action.

00:09.770 --> 00:10.330
All right.

00:10.340 --> 00:13.940
So this is the home page of my website by default.

00:13.940 --> 00:20.590
WordPress makes your home page simply a listing of all of your latest blog posts.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.420
However not everyone wants that for their home page.

00:24.440 --> 00:30.180
Maybe you would rather move your blog to a dedicated page in your navigation named blog.

00:30.470 --> 00:35.550
And that would free up your home page for whatever custom content you want to use.

00:35.570 --> 00:37.860
So let's go ahead and set that up.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.180
It's actually very simple to create a custom home page.

00:41.270 --> 00:48.690
So the first step is to jump over to our admin dashboard area and what we're going to do is create two

00:48.750 --> 00:50.370
new pages.

00:50.820 --> 00:59.700
So in the left hand side bar look for pages and then click add new this first page that I'm creating

00:59.700 --> 01:04.930
will be my home page so I will give it a title of welcome.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.870
So that way the first thing visitors of my website will see is a large welcome headline.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.770
But you don't have to name it welcome.

01:11.820 --> 01:18.060
You could use whatever title you want for your home page within the main content field for the time

01:18.060 --> 01:18.470
being.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.450
I will just add a bit of placeholder content.

01:21.510 --> 01:26.650
This is temporary home page placeholder content.

01:26.850 --> 01:27.780
You get the idea.

01:27.990 --> 01:33.260
And then I will go ahead and click the right hand blue publish button OK.

01:33.260 --> 01:39.870
Now let's create another page so you can use this add new button or you can use this add new button.

01:41.930 --> 01:45.610
This new page will be the generic blog listing screen.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.220
So I'm going to give it a title of blog but maybe you want to name it.

01:50.210 --> 01:57.110
News or journal or something along those lines you get the idea but I'm going to name my own blog.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.150
You can name it whatever you want.

01:59.360 --> 02:05.190
And for this page we can literally leave this main content field completely blank.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.280
Then let's just go ahead and use the right hand blue publish button.

02:10.290 --> 02:10.770
All right.

02:10.770 --> 02:19.110
And with those two new pages created our next step is to look in the left hand side bar for settings

02:19.460 --> 02:22.380
so settings is towards the very bottom of the menu.

02:22.620 --> 02:27.110
And then within it pop up menu look for the reading item.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.060
So I click on reading.

02:29.250 --> 02:36.600
Now this first option is what we're interested in so it reads front page displays and then you can choose

02:36.600 --> 02:43.030
between your latest posts which is the generic blog listing that our home page is currently using.

02:43.290 --> 02:47.960
Or you can click on this option use a static page.

02:48.150 --> 02:54.030
So I'm going to click on that option and then that will let me customize these two options.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.740
So this first field lets me choose what I want my front page or home page to be.

02:58.740 --> 03:03.830
So if I click on this I can choose from any of my currently existing pages.

03:04.020 --> 03:08.060
I'm going to choose the welcome page that we created just a moment ago.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.130
I want that to be my front page or home page.

03:11.130 --> 03:16.640
And then for this field the Post's page that will just be the generic blog listing.

03:16.830 --> 03:23.520
So again I can choose any of my pages but obviously I'm going to choose that brand new blog page that

03:23.520 --> 03:25.330
I just created.

03:25.380 --> 03:25.670
All right.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.480
This looks good.

03:26.490 --> 03:31.460
And now I'm going to click this blue save changes towards the bottom.

03:31.540 --> 03:37.750
And now let's jump back to our public front facing web site to see these changes in action.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.650
Perfect.

03:38.650 --> 03:44.590
So this is the home page and now the only content we see is from that welcome page we created just a

03:44.590 --> 03:45.560
moment ago.

03:45.850 --> 03:52.060
Next lets work on adding a link to our main navigation menu that will point towards our main generic

03:52.060 --> 03:58.620
blog listing or in other words that page that I created just a moment ago that I titled blog.

03:58.900 --> 04:05.830
So to edit this navigation menu I will jump to the admin area within the sidebar I will look for appearance

04:06.070 --> 04:10.560
and then within this pop up menu I will click on menus.

04:10.590 --> 04:11.020
All right.

04:11.020 --> 04:16.690
By this point we are at least a little bit familiar with this menu screen so we know that this area

04:16.690 --> 04:19.990
is a list of all of our available pages.

04:20.200 --> 04:27.640
So if I want to add blog to the menu I just checked the checkbox and then click add to Menu perfect

04:27.670 --> 04:32.920
Here's that new link and maybe I want to drag and drop it so that it's towards the top or the front

04:33.190 --> 04:40.420
of my menu and then I can just click save menu and then if I switch back to my public Web site.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.500
Here's the home page again only now noticed the menu bar includes a link to a blog and when I click

04:46.500 --> 04:54.150
it here we see the blog listings for all categories that just a few minutes ago was our home page.

04:54.150 --> 05:00.220
Now it's up to you if you actually want to use a blog link in your navigation for this particular Web

05:00.220 --> 05:01.390
site that I'm working on.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.470
I'm not sure that I want this link.

05:03.510 --> 05:10.380
I think I'm happy just having a static content home page along with my travel blog category page in

05:10.380 --> 05:13.080
my recipes category blog page.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.660
So the choice is yours.

05:14.670 --> 05:21.040
You do not have to include a generic blog link but a lot of people will indeed want a blog area.

05:21.060 --> 05:24.300
So I wanted to be sure to show you how to set that up.

05:24.330 --> 05:24.780
All right.

05:24.780 --> 05:30.150
Now before we bring this lesson to a close let's remember that practice makes perfect.

05:30.240 --> 05:36.270
So let's work on adding a bit of real content to this home page welcome page.

05:36.270 --> 05:43.480
So I will jump back to my admin dashboard in the sidebar I will look for pages I will click on that.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.960
Here's a list of all of the pages I currently have down at the bottom.

05:47.970 --> 05:49.460
I see the welcome page.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.130
That's the one I want to edit so I will click on it.

05:53.250 --> 05:57.930
I'm happy with the title but I think this main content could use a bit of work.

05:57.930 --> 06:03.540
So I will delete this and it's not very much fun for you to watch me type out a bunch of text.

06:03.570 --> 06:09.890
So instead I will just paste in a few paragraphs so it says Hello and welcome.

06:09.890 --> 06:14.440
This is my home page and then just a bit of Lorem some dummy text.

06:14.690 --> 06:17.930
So feel free to type out your own text for this page.

06:18.080 --> 06:23.010
But what I really wanted to practice with you are the simple tasks of a.

06:23.120 --> 06:30.200
Adding an image to this page and be creating links to our other pages within these paragraphs.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.850
I know that we've done both of those things in the course so far but I think a little repetition and

06:34.850 --> 06:37.330
a little bit of practice is always a good thing.

06:37.520 --> 06:43.760
So for example I want to add a photograph of myself that will sit right about here on the page and I

06:43.760 --> 06:49.500
want the text to sort of wrap around it so I will place my cursor at the beginning of this paragraph

06:50.830 --> 06:55.000
OK and then I'm going to insert an image and sort of float it to the right.

06:55.030 --> 07:03.300
So again with my cursor right about here before the word read I will click this add media button.

07:03.350 --> 07:10.430
I'm going to upload a brand new photograph of myself so I will use this upload files link then I will

07:10.430 --> 07:12.500
click select files.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.710
Here I have a file named Bradd with cat.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.410
That's the photo I want to use.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.890
Let me direct your attention towards the right hand side of the page.

07:20.910 --> 07:26.640
So down here Word Press remembers my alignment choice from the last time I inserted an image.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.700
But feel free to choose a different option if you like.

07:29.700 --> 07:35.380
I do want to float the image to the right hand side of the content so I'll choose right.

07:35.400 --> 07:41.010
I will leave the size set to medium for now and then I will just click insert into page.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.120
I think that looks good.

07:43.150 --> 07:47.620
Next let's practice creating links within our paragraphs of text.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.230
So for example here we see read about my story.

07:51.270 --> 07:55.340
Maybe I want those words to be a link to the About Us page.

07:55.470 --> 08:01.550
So I just highlight and drag that text and then use this link up in the menu bar.

08:01.620 --> 08:07.230
When I hover over it it reads insert and edit link that brings up this menu and now I can just start

08:07.230 --> 08:10.050
typing or searching for the page I am looking for.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.200
So I'm looking for the About Us page.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.750
Here it is so I can just click on this result here.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.920
And then click this blue apply button.

08:18.990 --> 08:19.320
All right.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.190
Next up I see.

08:20.190 --> 08:21.980
Check out my photo gallery.

08:22.080 --> 08:30.290
So maybe I want the words photo gallery to link to the photo gallery page so I select that begin searching

08:30.290 --> 08:32.810
for that page here it is.

08:32.810 --> 08:36.220
Photo Gallery hit the blue apply next.

08:36.380 --> 08:43.310
I see this sentence that reads I blog about places I visit and also my favorite recipes so maybe I want

08:43.310 --> 08:48.560
places I visit to link to the travel category page.

08:48.770 --> 08:52.100
So let's highlight those words and then click the link button.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.170
Search for travel.

08:54.470 --> 08:58.070
Now you'll notice that WordPress doesn't give me any results here.

08:58.160 --> 09:04.650
Now in the future WordPress might update their software to automatically find category archive pages.

09:04.880 --> 09:11.380
But as of this moment we're going to need to find our travel pages you Arel by ourselves.

09:11.570 --> 09:13.640
So let me show you how I would do that.

09:13.640 --> 09:19.130
Remember we can always use this link to jump to our public facing web site only if I click on that right

09:19.130 --> 09:19.600
now.

09:19.610 --> 09:23.200
It will take me away from this page authoring screen.

09:23.330 --> 09:32.770
So what I can do instead is right click on it and click Open link in new tab OK then within my new browser

09:32.770 --> 09:40.520
tab I can switch to that and then just use my navigation area to click on travel and now in my address

09:40.520 --> 09:48.380
bar I can see either you are l for the travel page so I will just select that copy it back in my first

09:48.380 --> 09:49.630
tab.

09:49.640 --> 09:55.420
Now I can just paste in that u r l within this little menu so pasted in.

09:55.420 --> 09:59.980
Hit the blue apply button OK and let's do the same thing for right here where it says.

09:59.990 --> 10:06.380
Also my favorite recipes so I will highlight favorite recipes and I want that to link to the recipe

10:06.380 --> 10:07.680
screen.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.880
So click this link button back in my other tab.

10:10.880 --> 10:15.790
I will just navigate to the recipes page and then up in my address bar.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.830
I will just select the address that you are on.

10:18.830 --> 10:21.800
Copy it back in this tab.

10:21.800 --> 10:26.930
I will paste in the URL and click Apply finally.

10:27.050 --> 10:31.450
Down with within this sentence it says if you want to share any ideas with me I'd love for you to get

10:31.450 --> 10:33.990
in touch with me so I will highlight.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.980
Get in touch with me and link that to my contact page.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.410
So click this link.

10:40.450 --> 10:42.950
Begin searching for contact.

10:42.970 --> 10:48.000
There it is click on that hit the blue apply and we are in business.

10:48.070 --> 10:50.170
So now I'm happy with this page.

10:50.290 --> 10:53.310
Let me use the right hand blue update button.

10:55.390 --> 10:58.810
And now I can use the top left link to jump to my home page.

10:58.810 --> 11:00.560
My public facing Web site.

11:00.730 --> 11:01.260
Perfect.

11:01.270 --> 11:02.720
So we have our new content.

11:02.740 --> 11:07.320
We've got my photograph and we have the different links that we just created.

11:07.540 --> 11:12.420
And I think this is a much better home page than what we had when this lesson first began.

11:12.550 --> 11:18.460
Instead of a generic blog listing now we have a bit of welcome text and we linking out to our various

11:18.460 --> 11:19.330
pages.

11:19.330 --> 11:23.320
We are letting our visitors know what they can find on this website.

11:23.320 --> 11:28.660
I think this is just a much better experience but obviously on your website you're free to do whatever

11:28.660 --> 11:29.490
you would like.

11:29.680 --> 11:36.180
So if you want to keep your home page as the blog listings screen by all means that's absolutely OK.

11:36.250 --> 11:42.010
That's actually going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson we will change gears a bit

11:42.220 --> 11:44.670
and jump back to blog posts.

11:44.890 --> 11:47.790
Let me give you a bit of a sneak peek of what we're going to learn.

11:47.980 --> 11:56.500
So for example in my menu bar if I navigate to the travel page this page will show us the latest posts

11:56.500 --> 12:02.080
from the travel category and currently it displays the full content of each post.

12:02.380 --> 12:08.530
But I think it would be better if it only showed maybe the first few sentences and then included a link

12:08.530 --> 12:11.200
that said click to read more.

12:11.200 --> 12:17.650
Also I think it would be nice if each post included a thumbnail image or featured image to grab the

12:17.650 --> 12:19.500
attention of our visitors.

12:19.690 --> 12:25.330
Well as you might have guessed those are the exact two changes that we will learn how to make in our

12:25.330 --> 12:26.680
next lesson.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.140
It should be a ton of fun.

12:28.150 --> 12:30.730
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
