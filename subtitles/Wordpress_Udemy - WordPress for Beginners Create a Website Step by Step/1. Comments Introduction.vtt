00:00.980 --> 00:06.280
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about comments.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.270
Here's a quick overview of what we will cover.

00:09.290 --> 00:16.460
So first we will answer the question what is a comment next we will answer the question.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.110
Can I disable comments.

00:19.160 --> 00:24.280
And finally we will answer the question what is comment moderation.

00:24.450 --> 00:24.790
OK.

00:24.830 --> 00:27.130
So let's go through these one by one.

00:27.170 --> 00:31.520
Without further ado let's begin with what is a comment.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.720
All right so here we are on the home page of my web site.

00:34.970 --> 00:41.180
And before I show you what a comment is I think there's a good chance you're already familiar with comments

00:41.510 --> 00:47.630
because if you've ever used Facebook or Twitter you know that when you post something your friends can

00:47.630 --> 00:50.170
leave comments on that post.

00:50.410 --> 00:50.870
OK.

00:50.870 --> 00:56.500
And that same concept of commenting on posts exists in wordpress.

00:56.720 --> 01:02.720
So for example if I use my main navigation to go to the travel blog archive.

01:03.110 --> 01:10.650
And then if I click on this trip to the Midwest post from this trip to the Midwest detail post screen

01:10.650 --> 01:16.570
if I scroll down towards the bottom you will see this leave a reply area.

01:16.820 --> 01:22.640
So within this comment field box I can click to place my cursor there and then begin typing so I can

01:22.640 --> 01:27.140
say this is an amazing post.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.270
I love it.

01:28.310 --> 01:28.720
All right.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.820
And now finally to submit that comment.

01:30.830 --> 01:32.840
I can just click this button down here.

01:34.520 --> 01:41.070
And now whenever someone visits the detail screen for the trip to the Midwest post we scroll down below

01:41.070 --> 01:42.480
the content.

01:42.720 --> 01:49.780
Here we see that comment that I just left now because I'm currently logged into WordPress as the admin

01:49.800 --> 01:51.840
or the owner of this Web site.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.700
It was very easy for me to leave a comment.

01:54.810 --> 01:59.670
I only had to fill out the one single text field and then with one click of a button.

01:59.790 --> 02:02.570
My comment was added to the Web site.

02:02.610 --> 02:06.250
However most comments you receive will not be from yourself.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.940
They will be from other people.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.330
So now let me open up another web browser.

02:11.670 --> 02:12.430
Here we go.

02:12.450 --> 02:16.830
And in this browser window I am not logged into WordPress.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.190
Right.

02:17.190 --> 02:21.400
So notice that there is no black admin bar across the top of the page.

02:21.570 --> 02:26.010
So this is what the general public will see when they visit my website.

02:26.040 --> 02:31.610
So now I will try to leave a comment as a stranger or just a random visitor of the Web site.

02:31.830 --> 02:35.510
So I will click on travel.

02:35.710 --> 02:44.070
And then I will click on trip to the Midwest I will scroll down to the bottom here I can see the comment

02:44.100 --> 02:50.100
that the administrator left and if I scroll down further here is a form that strangers are just random

02:50.100 --> 02:52.260
visitors of the Web site can fill out.

02:52.410 --> 02:55.380
So first they will type out their comment.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.270
The sky is blue.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.680
And this post is excellent.

03:01.260 --> 03:03.530
Thank you for writing it.

03:03.890 --> 03:04.310
All right.

03:04.320 --> 03:09.750
But if I scroll down a bit further we see that there are a few other fields that strangers or random

03:09.750 --> 03:11.610
visitors will need to fill out.

03:11.940 --> 03:17.030
So because they are not logged into WordPress we will want them to provide a name for themselves.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.800
In this case I will just say that my name is John Doe.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.990
We also want them to provide an email address.

03:24.090 --> 03:30.870
In this case I will say that my email is John Doe at Jondo dot gov and then the Web site field is not

03:30.870 --> 03:36.900
mandatory so I can leave that blank and then I can just click this post comment button.

03:39.180 --> 03:39.700
All right.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.970
And here we can see that comment.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.060
And there's one detail that I want to draw your attention to this message that reads.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.100
Your comment is awaiting moderation.

03:50.210 --> 03:57.140
What this means is that currently Jondo is the only person that will see this comment on this trip to

03:57.140 --> 03:59.930
the Midwest detailed post screen.

04:00.170 --> 04:05.350
The general public at this moment in time will not see this comment.

04:05.360 --> 04:12.420
The owner of the website or the admin will need to approve this comment before it gets truly published.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.710
So the entire world can see it on this post.

04:15.740 --> 04:20.310
So for example if I open up yet another web browser on my computer.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.400
So here we go.

04:21.650 --> 04:27.530
And in this window I am neither the admin or owner of the website nor am I John Doe.

04:27.710 --> 04:33.110
So pretend that this window is just another random visitor of the Web site and if I go to the travel

04:33.110 --> 04:40.150
page and then click on the trip to the Midwest post I scroll down to the comments you can see there's

04:40.160 --> 04:43.000
only just the one comment from the admin.

04:43.040 --> 04:49.160
So again in order for the entire world to be able to see that comment from John Doe an administrator

04:49.160 --> 04:53.240
of the Wordpress Web site needs to review and approve that comment.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.020
So let's do that right now.

04:55.220 --> 05:01.340
So let me jump back to this window so you'll see that at the top of this window there's the black admin

05:01.340 --> 05:02.240
bar.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.430
So this is the window where I'm signed in as the admin.

05:05.480 --> 05:12.650
So if I click on this link towards the top left that will take me to the Wordpress admin dashboard and

05:12.650 --> 05:16.340
let's look in the left hand side bar for comments.

05:16.340 --> 05:17.120
So here it is.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.590
About halfway down.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.140
Let's click on that.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.580
All right and we see two comments.

05:22.730 --> 05:28.360
WordPress highlights the comments that are awaiting moderation in a beige background color.

05:28.370 --> 05:34.130
So for this first comment we see that it was created by John Doe and it reads The sky is blue and this

05:34.130 --> 05:35.030
post is excellent.

05:35.030 --> 05:41.630
Thank you for writing it now while my cursor or mouse is hovered over any part of this top comment these

05:41.690 --> 05:43.300
options here will appear.

05:43.430 --> 05:47.590
So in this case I want to click on this first option to approve the comment.

05:47.810 --> 05:53.480
But if someone left you a really mean spirited foul comment or if they left you a spam comment.

05:53.510 --> 05:56.890
We will talk more about spam comments in a couple of minutes.

05:56.900 --> 06:02.480
You could click either trash or spam but again in this case I will click approve because this looks

06:02.480 --> 06:05.980
like a very nice kind hearted comment so I approve.

06:06.200 --> 06:12.650
And now if I jump back to my other web browser window where I was pretending to be a random stranger

06:12.950 --> 06:19.850
and if I refreshed this page again this is the trip to the Midwest detailed post screen so if I scroll

06:19.850 --> 06:24.810
down to the bottom now we see two thoughts on trip to the Midwest.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.610
This is the comment we created as the administrator.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.410
And here we see the comment from Jondo.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.970
All right so that was a quick overview of what a comment is.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.970
At this point let's change gears a bit and now answer the question.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.720
Can I disable comments right.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.370
Because comments can be great.

06:43.400 --> 06:49.210
They can allow discussions to emerge organically on their web site but comments are not for everyone.

06:49.220 --> 06:51.740
And comments are not for every Web site.

06:51.950 --> 06:57.710
In a lot of instances comments will appear unprofessional comments may just not fit with the mood of

06:57.710 --> 06:58.530
your website.

06:58.670 --> 07:03.660
So first let me show you how to disable comments on individual posts.

07:03.770 --> 07:06.010
So on a post by post basis.

07:06.140 --> 07:11.830
And then after that I will show you how to disable comments for all posts going forward.

07:12.110 --> 07:18.550
OK so for our first example let me go over to the travel page or I should say the travel category archive

07:18.560 --> 07:24.570
screen and instead of trip to the Midwest let me click on trip to the east coast.

07:24.770 --> 07:30.630
So if I scroll down here we see the lever reply area where I can create the comment.

07:30.800 --> 07:37.160
And let's imagine that I want to disable commenting just for this particular trip to the east coast

07:37.160 --> 07:41.750
post but maybe I don't want to disable commenting on my entire website.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.680
So in that case what I would do is head over to my admin area.

07:45.950 --> 07:54.670
Click on posts here is trip to the east coast so I will click on that and currently If I scroll down

07:54.670 --> 08:01.680
towards the bottom of this page in the left hand column I do not see a comment or discussion box.

08:01.870 --> 08:09.430
However if I scroll back up to the top and click on the top right screen options menu so click right

08:09.430 --> 08:10.960
about here.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.630
All of these new options appear.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.620
And now we see this discussion option with a check box.

08:16.630 --> 08:22.930
So go ahead and check the check box for discussion and then you can click screen options again to close

08:22.930 --> 08:23.760
that menu.

08:23.830 --> 08:29.470
And now if I scroll down towards the bottom of this page here we see a discussion box.

08:29.650 --> 08:32.260
So the first option is allow comments.

08:32.260 --> 08:39.900
Let me uncheck that and the second option reads allow trackback and ping backs on this page.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.200
So the question is what does a trackback What does a ping back.

08:43.210 --> 08:49.660
Well in this example if another Web site on the internet linked to my trip to the east coast post and

08:49.660 --> 08:55.570
then someone clicked on that link from their website over to my website WordPress would create something

08:55.570 --> 09:00.880
that almost looks like a comment but is technically considered a trackback where a ping back and it

09:00.880 --> 09:04.810
would basically just list the other web site that linked to my post.

09:04.810 --> 09:10.420
Now you're free to leave that enabled but 100 percent of the time I uncheck this box.

09:10.420 --> 09:16.120
I never leave trackback and ping BACS enabled on my web sites because personally they seem tacky they

09:16.120 --> 09:21.730
seem spammy because I have no control over who's going to link the content on my website and I don't

09:21.730 --> 09:25.430
want to list a bunch of random references on my posts.

09:25.470 --> 09:31.510
Anyways the key point here is that we are unchecking the allow comments box so let's scroll back up

09:31.600 --> 09:32.830
and click Update.

09:32.830 --> 09:39.920
Save this post and now if I use this link to go back to this post on the front end of my web site if

09:39.930 --> 09:46.100
we scroll down to the bottom we see that that reply area to create a comment is completely gone.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.490
It disappeared.

09:47.630 --> 09:52.960
All right so that's how you can disable comments on a post by post basis.

09:52.960 --> 09:58.810
Next you might be wondering what if I want to disable comments for my entire website so I don't want

09:58.810 --> 10:02.810
anyone to be able to leave a comment on any page or any post.

10:02.980 --> 10:04.770
Let me show you how to set that up.

10:04.780 --> 10:10.660
So again let's use this link to head back to the admin dashboard in the left hand side bar towards the

10:10.660 --> 10:18.400
bottom let's hover over settings and then within the pop up menu click on discussion OK.

10:18.410 --> 10:22.320
Now these first three options are the ones that we're interested in.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.020
So here we can see that these are the default settings.

10:26.090 --> 10:30.790
These options will be used whenever we create any new posts in the future.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.270
So for example let's uncheck this option first so it reads.

10:35.450 --> 10:43.160
Allow people to post comments on new articles so if we uncheck that box now any post we create from

10:43.160 --> 10:47.390
this moment forward will have comments disabled.

10:47.390 --> 10:49.930
We can also uncheck this option.

10:50.270 --> 10:57.230
So now any post we create from this moment forward will have track backs and ping backs disabled.

10:57.980 --> 11:03.560
And then while we are at it we can also uncheck this option and that way our Web site won't attempt

11:03.620 --> 11:07.560
to create trackback or pink backs on other people's websites.

11:07.760 --> 11:13.940
So with these three options unchecked lets just scroll down towards the bottom of this page and click

11:13.940 --> 11:16.100
on this blue save changes button.

11:17.140 --> 11:23.070
All right so now any post we create from this moment forward will have comments disabled.

11:23.070 --> 11:28.350
However I do want to point out that if you were trying to disable comments on your website entirely

11:28.740 --> 11:35.280
these three options will not take effect retroactively meaning any blog posts that I created in the

11:35.280 --> 11:38.790
past before I unchecked these options.

11:38.820 --> 11:42.720
Those blog posts will still have commenting enabled.

11:42.720 --> 11:51.010
So for example if I click on posts in my sidebar and for example if I click on easy spaghetti this easy

11:51.010 --> 11:56.950
spaghetti post is one that I created in the past long before I just updated those universal comments

11:56.950 --> 11:57.820
settings.

11:57.930 --> 12:04.630
And so if I scroll down towards the bottom you'll see that it still has allow comments checked so I

12:04.630 --> 12:12.510
would need to uncheck those boxes and then click Update so long story short if you are creating a brand

12:12.510 --> 12:18.540
new Web site and you know right away that you do not want comments then one of the very first things

12:18.540 --> 12:25.400
you do when you get your Wordpress web site should be to go into settings discussion and uncheck these

12:25.400 --> 12:26.530
options.

12:26.600 --> 12:31.280
If you do that right away when your website is still brand new and you haven't really created any posts

12:31.280 --> 12:36.920
yet you'll be in a great position because then any posts you create from that moment forward will have

12:36.920 --> 12:38.880
commenting disabled.

12:38.900 --> 12:39.280
All right.

12:39.290 --> 12:42.230
So we just reviewed how to disable comments.

12:42.260 --> 12:46.850
Now let's change gears and talk a little bit about comment moderation.

12:47.120 --> 12:52.160
So we actually already covered comment moderation a little bit earlier in the lesson.

12:52.370 --> 12:59.930
So if I jump back to my admin area and in the sidebar click on comments remember this is the screen

12:59.960 --> 13:06.620
where we can hover over a comment and then either approve it or unapproved it or market as spam or send

13:06.620 --> 13:07.940
it to the trash.

13:07.940 --> 13:08.240
All right.

13:08.250 --> 13:15.080
And any time we perform one of those actions that's an example of comment moderation we are moderating

13:15.080 --> 13:16.490
the comments.

13:16.490 --> 13:17.810
That's really all there is to it.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.900
It's pretty simple.

13:19.070 --> 13:24.830
But I do want to show you a few settings that you can change to fine tune commenting on your Web site

13:24.830 --> 13:26.280
to meet your preferences.

13:26.420 --> 13:32.360
So in the left hand side bar towards the bottom if we hover over settings and then click on discussion

13:33.800 --> 13:40.100
I want to bring your attention to this portion of the screen so it reads before a comment appears.

13:40.280 --> 13:46.750
And then we have these two options that we can check or uncheck by default only the second one is checked.

13:46.820 --> 13:52.020
So it reads comment author must have a previously approved comment.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.530
This is the default option that WordPress gives us.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.200
And I think it's a great option.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.510
So nine times out of 10 I just roll with this setting.

13:59.510 --> 14:05.540
Basically once we as the administrator approve a comment from someone then any time that person wants

14:05.540 --> 14:11.030
to leave another comment on our Web site using the same e-mail address that we already approved they

14:11.030 --> 14:12.100
are free to do so.

14:12.110 --> 14:15.190
We don't have to approve any of their comments in the future.

14:15.290 --> 14:18.970
I think this is a great option because it frees up our time as an admin.

14:19.040 --> 14:24.530
So once someone leaves a decent respectable comment on our Web site we can trust them a little bit.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.520
So then in the future we don't need to babysit them when they submit a comment.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.900
It just automatically gets published.

14:30.950 --> 14:36.740
But if you want to retain full control over which comments appear on your Web site you can uncheck that

14:36.740 --> 14:42.590
option and check this box for all comments must be manually approved.

14:42.620 --> 14:48.480
On the other end of the spectrum if you're a fan of chaos and anarchy you just trust people implicitly.

14:48.590 --> 14:54.800
You can uncheck both of these boxes and then anyone in the world can leave a comment and have it immediately

14:54.800 --> 14:56.670
appear on your Web site.

14:56.700 --> 15:02.750
Personally to me that option seems a bit extreme a bit risky because the Internet is not always a nice

15:02.750 --> 15:09.260
place and people might leave really foul comments that might tarnish the brand of your website or the

15:09.260 --> 15:12.140
brand of your company but that's totally up to you.

15:12.140 --> 15:16.630
So feel free to check these boxes based on your own personal preferences.

15:16.700 --> 15:21.880
Personally nine times out of ten I think this default setup is a good way to go.

15:21.890 --> 15:24.100
All right now let's change gears a little bit.

15:24.110 --> 15:29.980
Remember earlier in the lesson I promised that we would talk about spam comments a bit later on.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.490
So let's cover that now.

15:31.550 --> 15:38.930
The question you might have is what is a spam comment a spam comment is not a mean spirited comment

15:38.990 --> 15:46.460
or a troll comment a spam comment is a comment created by a robot that was programmed to scan the Internet

15:46.490 --> 15:53.180
for websites that allow comments and then automatically leave pre-created comments that don't make any

15:53.180 --> 15:57.580
sense that have links to other perhaps malicious Web sites.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.040
Right so it's just like a spam email.

16:00.050 --> 16:06.710
The villains of the Internet create spam email robots that send out spam emails to millions of people.

16:06.770 --> 16:07.070
All right.

16:07.070 --> 16:13.160
Well those same villains create spam robots that leave spam comments on every Web site.

16:13.370 --> 16:19.070
Now spam comments are a big reason that I leave these options the way they are right so I don't want

16:19.070 --> 16:27.200
all comments to appear on my Web site because 99 percent of comments are spam created by spam robots.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.550
Now at this point you might be thinking to yourself.

16:29.750 --> 16:30.170
Great.

16:30.170 --> 16:32.420
Did I just inherit a fulltime job.

16:32.420 --> 16:37.770
Do I need to constantly be on the lookout for millions of incoming spam comments on my website.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.690
Well luckily the answer is No.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.580
Now that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

16:43.670 --> 16:49.970
But in our next lesson we will learn about perhaps the biggest plugin in wordpress history.

16:49.970 --> 16:56.840
There is a plugin named Kismet that will block about ninety nine point nine percent of incoming spam

16:56.840 --> 16:58.070
comments.

16:58.070 --> 17:03.950
So in our next lesson we will learn how to install and set up a kismet and we will shut down those dirty

17:03.950 --> 17:08.200
filthy spam robots once and for all should be a lot of fun.

17:08.300 --> 17:12.050
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
