00:01.000 --> 00:09.100
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about categories before we ask ourselves the question what

00:09.190 --> 00:10.750
is a category.

00:10.870 --> 00:15.330
Let's begin by looking at our website and giving ourselves a goal.

00:15.340 --> 00:21.400
So our goal for this lesson is to add to new links to the main navigation menu.

00:21.490 --> 00:26.650
One link will be named travel and the other will be named recipes.

00:26.920 --> 00:33.310
When we click on travel it should take us to a listing of only blog posts that are related to travel

00:33.640 --> 00:40.420
and when we click on recipes it should take us to a listing of only blog posts that include recipes

00:40.840 --> 00:45.470
in order to achieve this we are going to leverage something called categories.

00:45.700 --> 00:53.070
Let's begin by jumping over to our admin dashboard and creating a few dummy filler example blog posts

00:53.620 --> 01:00.280
so I will use this link in my top bar to jump to the admin area and then in my left hand side bar I

01:00.280 --> 01:06.840
will look for posts and within this menu I will use add new.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.110
All right now on my example website travel is going to be one of my categories so I might name one of

01:14.110 --> 01:15.680
my blog posts.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.910
Trip to the west coast.

01:19.090 --> 01:21.590
But in your case when you're following along.

01:21.670 --> 01:24.760
Feel free to make up whatever category you want.

01:24.760 --> 01:31.750
Maybe instead of travel related blog posts you have blog posts related to automobiles or computers or

01:31.750 --> 01:35.450
the Stock Exchange or the weather or I don't know anything right.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.610
So feel free to use whatever content you want down here in this field.

01:39.610 --> 01:43.930
I will just paste in a bit of law and some dummy content.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.260
And now here is the important part.

01:46.330 --> 01:49.770
Over in the right hand column if we scroll down a little bit.

01:49.780 --> 01:55.150
Notice this box named categories as of this moment.

01:55.180 --> 02:00.640
I don't have any categories so you can see that the only box I have here to check is something called

02:01.090 --> 02:02.670
Uncategorized.

02:02.950 --> 02:06.860
So what I can do is use this add new category link.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.790
So if I click this add new category.

02:09.790 --> 02:15.040
Now I have this empty text field and I'm just going to type travel.

02:15.160 --> 02:21.920
Then scroll down a little bit and now I can click this add new category button perfect.

02:21.930 --> 02:28.410
So I just created a new category named travel and you can see that this box is checked and that's my

02:28.410 --> 02:34.830
way of telling WordPress that this new post that I'm creating trip to the west coast should be categorized

02:34.890 --> 02:37.230
under the travel category.

02:37.230 --> 02:38.310
All right this looks good.

02:38.320 --> 02:45.090
Sonand going to use the published button in the top right corner to save that blog post perfect.

02:45.090 --> 02:51.690
Here we see the success message Post published now just so we have a bit more content to experiment

02:51.690 --> 02:52.080
with.

02:52.080 --> 02:58.350
I'm going to create another new blog post under the travel category so I can use this add new button

02:58.350 --> 03:07.410
here or in my sidebar I can use this add new button so I will create another new blog post named trip

03:07.650 --> 03:13.830
to the east coast and then in this field I'll just paste in the dummy content again.

03:14.010 --> 03:19.560
Scroll down a little bit and in the right hand column I'm looking for this category's box and I will

03:19.560 --> 03:26.900
check travel and then I will save or publish this post while I'm at it.

03:26.910 --> 03:34.080
I will create another new post so a third of travel related post to add new I will title this one trip

03:34.500 --> 03:36.860
to the Midwest.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.590
Paste in a bit of filler content.

03:39.630 --> 03:40.770
Scroll down a bit.

03:40.770 --> 03:44.390
Within this category's box choose travel.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.030
Use this publish button to save this post.

03:48.450 --> 03:52.730
All right so now I have my three example travel posts.

03:52.740 --> 03:57.570
Next I'm going to create three example recipe posts.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.790
So again I will use this add new button.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.810
I will title this blog post.

04:03.950 --> 04:05.180
Easy.

04:05.180 --> 04:09.270
Spaghetti paste in a bit of filler content.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.390
And here's the important part.

04:11.450 --> 04:17.900
Down in the right hand column within this category's box I do not want to assign this easy spaghetti

04:17.900 --> 04:19.630
post to the travel category.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.270
Instead I want to create a new category.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.800
I want to add a new one so click add new category within this box.

04:26.810 --> 04:34.720
I will type recipes and then click the Add new category button perfect.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.750
So with this recipe's check mark checked I can just scroll up and publish or save this post.

04:41.730 --> 04:44.310
All right so that's one example recipe post.

04:44.310 --> 04:48.540
Let's create another one so add new I will name this post.

04:48.670 --> 04:56.460
Homemade french bread and then paste in a bit of dummy content.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.630
Scroll down.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.330
Look within this box.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.840
Check the recipes category and go ahead and publish or save this post.

05:06.190 --> 05:16.400
And finally let's create one additional recipe posts so add new I will title this one Greek salad paste

05:16.630 --> 05:26.440
in my content scroll down be sure to check the recipes checkbox under categories and then publish.

05:26.450 --> 05:32.990
All right so at this point I have all of my example posts ready to go and if I switch back to my public

05:32.990 --> 05:39.640
facing Web site here's the home page and we can see all of the posts that we just created.

05:40.100 --> 05:40.520
All right.

05:40.520 --> 05:48.470
And remember our goal is to add new links in our main navigation area of travel and recipes and when

05:48.470 --> 05:55.320
we click on one of those links we want to see a filtered listing of only that category of posts.

05:55.370 --> 06:00.950
So to add our two links to this navigation menu I'm just going to jump back to the admin portion of

06:00.950 --> 06:05.940
my web site using this top left link in the sidebar.

06:05.940 --> 06:08.020
I'm going to look for appearance.

06:08.430 --> 06:15.180
And then within this pop out menu I will look for the item named menus.

06:15.200 --> 06:15.760
All right.

06:15.770 --> 06:19.740
So here are the links that are currently in our main navigation menu.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.300
And remember we've used this area several times in the course so far.

06:24.380 --> 06:31.610
This is a listing of all available pages but you'll notice below that area we see a few other options

06:31.990 --> 06:33.120
posts.

06:33.290 --> 06:36.500
Custom links and categories.

06:36.560 --> 06:43.400
So if we click on this category's area now we are presented with a list of all of our categories and

06:43.400 --> 06:46.310
if I click on travel and then add to menu

06:49.160 --> 06:52.750
that will add a link to the travel category in our main menu.

06:52.970 --> 06:56.540
I also want to add a link to the recipe so I will check that.

06:56.540 --> 07:03.140
You could have checked both of them at the same time and then just clicked add two menu.

07:03.210 --> 07:04.470
All right there we see it.

07:04.470 --> 07:08.510
Now I want the Contact Us page to be the last link in the menu.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.700
So I'm just going to drag and drop it here.

07:10.980 --> 07:11.490
All right.

07:11.490 --> 07:19.900
The menu looks good to me so I will click the blue save menu button and now if I jump back to the public

07:19.900 --> 07:22.330
facing front end of my website.

07:22.420 --> 07:29.500
Here's the homepage but if I use the navigation menu to click on travel perfect.

07:29.500 --> 07:33.910
So here we see a filtered listing of only travel related posts.

07:34.220 --> 07:41.750
So a trip to the Midwest trip to the east coast trip to the west coast and if I scroll back up and click

07:41.750 --> 07:50.380
on recipe's beautiful we see Greek salad homemade french bread and easy spaghetti.

07:50.380 --> 07:55.600
Now this is a great set up because maybe a week from now will come back to our website and want to add

07:55.600 --> 08:01.750
a new recipe and all we need to do is create a new post and assign it to the recipes category and it

08:01.750 --> 08:06.620
will automatically show up at the very top of our recipes page.

08:06.640 --> 08:12.250
Now at this point you might be thinking to yourself OK so I'm starting to get the grasp of things.

08:12.280 --> 08:18.820
Now I know how to create a dedicated page for only recipe blog posts and I have a dedicated page for

08:18.820 --> 08:21.190
travel related blog posts.

08:21.190 --> 08:25.280
Your next thought might be that maybe you don't want your home page.

08:25.330 --> 08:31.610
So if I clicked this logo to go back to my home page now maybe you don't want your home page to just

08:31.610 --> 08:35.780
be a generic blog listing of all categories.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.290
Right so instead maybe you want your home page to feature static content content that welcomes the visitors

08:44.290 --> 08:47.910
to the Web site and maybe features some of your top content.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.190
You get the idea.

08:49.270 --> 08:53.680
Not everyone wants their home page to be a generic blog listing.

08:53.680 --> 08:59.210
So in our next lesson we will learn how to create a custom home page.

08:59.350 --> 09:04.540
You will learn how to make your home page contain whatever content you want it to have and perhaps you

09:04.540 --> 09:11.740
want to move your generic or category's blog listing to a new page named blog and maybe include a link

09:11.740 --> 09:14.230
to that in the main navigation menu.

09:14.230 --> 09:18.950
Or maybe you just don't want a generic all category blog listing at all.

09:18.970 --> 09:22.780
Maybe you only want these filtered category blog pages.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.460
It's totally up to you right.

09:24.460 --> 09:28.750
This is your Web site and you can structure it however you please.

09:28.750 --> 09:33.960
All right so coming up next we will learn how to create a custom home page should be a ton of fun.

09:34.020 --> 09:37.960
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
