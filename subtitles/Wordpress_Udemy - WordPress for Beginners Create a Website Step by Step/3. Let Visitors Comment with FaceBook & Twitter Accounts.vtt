00:01.040 --> 00:09.710
Hello everyone in this lesson we will learn about a plug in named discuss the disgust plug in replaces

00:09.710 --> 00:17.270
the default WordPress commenting system and the new discuss commenting system allows visitors of our

00:17.350 --> 00:22.640
website to leave comments using their existing social media accounts.

00:22.820 --> 00:28.310
So meaning their Facebook or Twitter or their Google account and what's nice is it will automatically

00:28.310 --> 00:33.410
pull in their profile photo like their avatar and also their name.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.720
So this way if someone comes to our website and wants to leave a comment on one of our posts they don't

00:38.720 --> 00:42.650
need to manually type in their name and their email address.

00:42.680 --> 00:48.360
They are probably already logged into one of the social media networks like Facebook or Twitter or Google.

00:48.530 --> 00:55.030
And now they're just one click away from leaving a comment as they themselves logged into that account.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.880
I think this all make more sense when we see discuss in action.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.910
So without further ado let me show you how to set up.

01:01.910 --> 01:03.880
Discuss on your Web site.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.860
OK so here's my web site.

01:05.900 --> 01:12.070
And before we get started I do want to point out that the disgust plug in is completely optional.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.530
You do not need to do this.

01:13.550 --> 01:18.020
So if you're happy with the default WordPress commenting system that's great.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.000
That's fantastic.

01:19.010 --> 01:22.640
If that's the case you can actually just skip this lesson.

01:22.640 --> 01:28.100
However if you are at all intrigued by the premise of discuss and you want your visitors to be able

01:28.100 --> 01:33.170
to comment using their social media accounts I think it's worth giving discuss a try.

01:33.380 --> 01:39.170
I'm not in any way affiliated with discuss but I am including it in this course because it's a very

01:39.170 --> 01:41.900
very popular solution in the real world.

01:41.900 --> 01:48.230
When I build websites for clients a lot of the times the client will request the discuss commenting

01:48.230 --> 01:49.060
system.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.640
It can really go a long way to help engage your audience.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.590
Now having said that and having stressed that this is completely optional.

01:56.690 --> 01:57.930
Let's get down to it.

01:58.100 --> 02:05.300
So if you want to try out discuss the first step is to head over to your Wordpress admin dashboard in

02:05.300 --> 02:07.640
your sidebar look for plugins.

02:07.640 --> 02:08.150
Here it is.

02:08.150 --> 02:10.300
Let's click on that.

02:10.390 --> 02:16.780
We want to install a new plug in so you can either use this button right here that says add new or you

02:16.780 --> 02:19.560
can use the add new link in the sidebar.

02:21.890 --> 02:25.650
From this screen let's use this top right search field.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.340
I will search for Discuss.

02:30.550 --> 02:36.780
Here it is the first result as of this recording it's got about 200000 or more active installs.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.790
So I will go ahead and click this install now button.

02:42.960 --> 02:51.350
Once it's finished installing Now I can click this blue activate button and now from my main install

02:51.350 --> 02:54.040
plug in screen here is discuss.

02:54.230 --> 03:00.530
And right under it I can click on this configure link I see a message which reads.

03:00.570 --> 03:03.660
You need to upgrade your database to continue.

03:03.840 --> 03:10.790
So I will click this upgrade button and now the disgust plug in is asking for my username and password

03:11.060 --> 03:18.350
now it is not asking for my wordpress username and password it's expecting me to have a discuss username

03:18.350 --> 03:19.250
and password.

03:19.400 --> 03:25.010
OK so at this point we've installed the plug in but now we need to go create an account with the disgust

03:25.010 --> 03:26.020
service.

03:26.020 --> 03:26.260
Right.

03:26.270 --> 03:30.060
So just like you would create an account with Facebook or Pinterest or Twitter.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.480
Let's go do that for Discuss.

03:32.480 --> 03:39.050
So you can google for Discuss or you can just right click on this link right here that reads don't have

03:39.050 --> 03:41.690
a disgust profile yet so I will.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.450
Right click on that and click Open link in new tab.

03:47.190 --> 03:52.050
And then if I jump over to that tab Here's the sign up page on the discuss Web site.

03:52.050 --> 03:57.660
So just go ahead and enter your name your e-mail and pick a password for yourself and then click sign

03:57.660 --> 03:59.500
up next.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.650
You will be taken to this screen and from here we are interested in this second option.

04:04.830 --> 04:08.430
It reads I want to install discuss on my site.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.380
So go ahead and click that.

04:12.510 --> 04:12.940
All right.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.980
These first two fields look good.

04:15.010 --> 04:20.300
The first field that we really need to customize is this Web site name field.

04:20.650 --> 04:26.350
So you and I are going to have different Web site names the name of my wordpress Web site is something

04:26.350 --> 04:32.290
along the lines of learning WordPress really you could type just about anything here.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.700
It doesn't need to perfectly match your Wordpress title.

04:35.890 --> 04:39.350
So make up a name for your web site here and then Category.

04:39.370 --> 04:43.030
I'm just going to choose tech technology.

04:43.330 --> 04:49.300
But feel free to choose whichever one makes the most sense for your particular website and then click

04:49.330 --> 04:53.460
Create site from this screen.

04:53.470 --> 04:54.430
I will just click this.

04:54.430 --> 04:54.870
Got it.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.210
Let's get started button down here.

04:57.700 --> 04:57.960
OK.

04:57.970 --> 05:01.930
Now disgust is asking me which platform my website uses.

05:02.110 --> 05:08.590
And as we can see Wordpress is so popular that it's the first choice WordPress powers between a fifth

05:08.620 --> 05:10.770
and a fourth of the entire web.

05:10.780 --> 05:16.980
So that was probably a safe guess on discusses part but just go ahead and click on WordPress here.

05:17.530 --> 05:22.150
Technically we didn't even need to click on WordPress because all this really does is give us a few

05:22.150 --> 05:26.590
instructions and we've actually already completed a few of these.

05:26.590 --> 05:32.740
So step one is just telling us to go into our WordPress admin and add the disgust plug in.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.740
So we've already done that.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.770
Step three is activate the plug in.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.190
We've already done that.

05:38.350 --> 05:44.020
So at this point let's jump back to the other tab and our web browser where we are still logged in as

05:44.020 --> 05:46.360
the admin in wordpress.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.540
If you can't remember how I got to this screen let me show you again.

05:49.570 --> 05:55.750
So from plug ins in the sidebar that will show you a list of all of your installed plug ins.

05:55.810 --> 06:00.490
And then under discussed click the configure link.

06:00.520 --> 06:07.510
OK so we're back on the screen only now we actually do have a discuss username and password.

06:07.510 --> 06:11.230
So go ahead and type those in and then click this next button.

06:11.230 --> 06:17.130
Once you do that this next screen will show you a list of all of your discuss Web sites.

06:17.140 --> 06:22.160
Now if you're brand new to discuss You're obviously only going to have the one discussed account Web

06:22.160 --> 06:24.680
site that you just set up just a moment ago.

06:24.850 --> 06:31.420
So go ahead and check the check box or radio box near that option and then click this balloon next option.

06:33.300 --> 06:37.920
And congratulations you just set up discuss on your Wordpress Web site.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.130
Let's take it for a test drive.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.890
So if we switch over to the public front facing version of our website let's go to the trip to the Midwest

06:45.890 --> 06:48.300
blog post and try to leave a comment.

06:48.590 --> 06:54.810
So I will click on travel and then I will click on trip to the Midwest.

06:54.810 --> 07:02.600
And now if I scroll down instead of the default WordPress comment area now we see this new area powered

07:02.600 --> 07:04.280
by discuss.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.730
Now I'm currently logged into disgust with my Bradd account.

07:07.730 --> 07:11.220
The account that I created to add disgust to this website.

07:11.330 --> 07:19.640
So it already has my photograph and I am free to leave a comment so I can say this is a test comment.

07:19.670 --> 07:22.340
I love the post.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.130
Amazing content.

07:24.300 --> 07:31.960
And then I can click this button that reads post as Brad and there we see it.

07:32.020 --> 07:37.830
So because I was already logged in as the Bradd admin discuss account that was very simple.

07:37.840 --> 07:43.000
Now let's pretend that we were just a random stranger visitor on the Internet coming to our Web site

07:43.000 --> 07:44.180
for the first time.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.440
So let me open up a new web browser.

07:46.630 --> 07:50.950
So in this window you can see that there's no black admin bar at the top.

07:50.950 --> 07:56.380
So in this window I am neither signed into WordPress nor am I signed in to discuss.

07:56.380 --> 08:01.120
So in this window let's try to leave a comment on the trip to the Midwest post.

08:01.120 --> 08:06.560
So click on travel and then click on trip to the Midwest.

08:07.460 --> 08:12.170
And if I scroll down here we can see the disgust comment area.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.520
Here's the comment that I just left as the admin in the other browser window.

08:16.920 --> 08:23.280
But if I want to leave a comment as a stranger I can just click into this field and begin typing my

08:23.280 --> 08:24.090
content.

08:24.090 --> 08:25.490
I love your blog.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.490
This post is great.

08:27.810 --> 08:33.780
OK now you will notice though that there's no submit button right here but disgust gives me a few options

08:33.930 --> 08:41.850
so I can log in either with a discuss account a Facebook account or Twitter account or a Google account.

08:41.850 --> 08:47.430
So for example if a visitor of our website was already logged into Facebook they could just click on

08:47.430 --> 08:50.010
the Facebook icon and be good to go.

08:50.010 --> 08:55.500
Or if a visitor of our website doesn't have an account with any of these networks yet they can click

08:55.500 --> 09:01.230
on this option to sign up for a discuss account right here and now they can just click here and then

09:01.230 --> 09:05.400
enter their name email and password and they will be good to go.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.310
Now that's really all there is to discuss Plug-In.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.410
It's pretty simple.

09:09.570 --> 09:15.860
But before we bring this lesson to a close I do want to show you how you can moderate comments right.

09:15.930 --> 09:21.180
So if someone leaves a malicious comment or if a spam comment makes its way through Here's what you

09:21.180 --> 09:22.020
can do.

09:22.140 --> 09:28.530
Back in the window where I am signed into WordPress as the admin you can see I have the black admin

09:28.530 --> 09:29.700
bar at the top.

09:29.910 --> 09:37.860
Let's jump over to the admin dashboard and in the sidebar let's click on comments and because we are

09:37.860 --> 09:44.430
using the discussed plug in you'll notice that the default WordPress comment moderation screen is empty.

09:44.490 --> 09:50.110
So instead now all we have is this blue button that reads go to discuss moderation.

09:50.460 --> 09:56.960
So if you click on that it will open a new tab in your web browser and you might need to log in using

09:56.960 --> 09:59.810
your discuss account user name and password.

09:59.870 --> 10:04.390
But from this screen now you can moderate the comments on your Web site.

10:04.510 --> 10:10.190
Now I don't currently have any comments but you can see up here that you can switch between viewing

10:10.400 --> 10:15.650
the comments that are waiting to be approved so the pending comments and the comments that have been

10:15.650 --> 10:21.620
approved the spam comments deleted or trashed comments and all comments.

10:21.620 --> 10:25.440
This disgust comment moderation screen is very intuitive to use.

10:25.580 --> 10:31.490
There's not much to say other than this is where you go to moderate your comments and that's actually

10:31.490 --> 10:37.070
going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson we will change gears.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.800
So we're done with comments.

10:38.900 --> 10:43.070
And up next we will learn about something named widgets.

10:43.070 --> 10:48.020
Widgets are an essential part of Wordpress and I will give you a hint or whet your appetite for the

10:48.020 --> 10:49.190
next lesson.

10:49.190 --> 10:56.560
Widgets are what will allow us to customize the sidebar column as well as other areas of our Web site.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.900
It's going to be a lot of fun.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.240
Let's keep things rolling.

10:59.270 --> 11:02.140
And I will see you in the next lesson.
