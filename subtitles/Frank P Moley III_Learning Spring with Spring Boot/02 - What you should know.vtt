00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] In order to be truly successful

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.003
in this course, there are a few prerequisites

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.009
that you will need in order to complete

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.004
all of the operations throughout this course.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.006
First and foremost, with the Spring Framework,

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.003
you can operate on several different JVM languages,

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.009
but for the purpose of this course,

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.005
we are going to use Java.

9
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.004
I'm going to have JDK 17 installed.

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.005
Now you can do this on earlier versions of Java,

11
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.003
but I'm going to use the latest and greatest

12
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:32.009
that's available to me today, which is 17.01.

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.008
Now you're going to need some basic

14
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.005
language knowledge of Java itself.

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.002
We won't get into any of the advanced concepts

16
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.006
of the language or any of the new functionality

17
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.006
with JDK 17.

18
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.003
So if you've used 11 or 14, you should be fine.

19
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.009
But the reality is you do need to know Java,

20
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.009
because this course is focused on Spring

21
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.007
and not on Java itself.

22
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.003
I'm going to make the assumption

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:58.007
as we're going through examples

24
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.009
that you understand the Java context

25
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.007
behind the scenes and I'm going to focus my time

26
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.005
working on Spring itself.

27
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.002
Now a reminder, the code that we are creating

28
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.008
in this course is demo code.

29
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.004
It is not production code.

30
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.004
As such, you may find times

31
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.002
where I may do something that

32
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.005
doesn't necessarily look the most performant,

33
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.002
but that's because I'm trying to focus

34
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.005
on Spring and not Java.

35
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.007
And to be honest, it doesn't really matter for demo code.

36
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:30.003
When you're writing production code,

37
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.002
things like performance and operations matter

38
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:37.001
a lot more than they do in a learning setting.

39
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.002
But ultimately, as long as you have a JDK installed

40
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:41.009
that is greater than 11,

41
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.008
you should be successful in this course,

42
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:48.005
assuming you have that base knowledge.

43
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.003
Now, the second tool that you're going to need

44
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.005
to have installed on your machine is Maven.

45
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, Spring supports both Maven and Gradle

46
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.001
but for the purposes of this course,

47
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.006
we're going to use Maven

48
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:02.009
mainly because I'm more familiar with it

49
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.000
and I feel that more developers in the Java world are.

50
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.002
I'm going to ask you to install

51
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:12.003
the latest version of Maven on your machine.

52
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:15.003
Now it's true that you don't technically need

53
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:19.000
to have Maven installed when you're using Spring Boot.

54
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.005
But many times I'm going to drop

55
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.008
into the command line and do operations

56
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.009
from the command line that are going to expect Maven.

57
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.000
So if you want to follow along,

58
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.007
you need to have it installed on your machine

59
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.005
or else you're going to be relying on

60
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:37.000
the executables that come with the Spring boot download

61
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.008
to do those Maven operations.

62
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.003
When it comes to installing Maven,

63
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.001
you're going to follow the OS specific

64
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.001
instructions from Apache,

65
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.002
and they're very good when it comes to

66
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:49.002
installing Maven on your machine

67
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:53.008
and setting up any appropriate environment variables.

68
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:55.006
Now, the next tool that you're going to need

69
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.004
in order to be successful in this course

70
00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:01.001
is access to a Postgres database.

71
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.004
Now for this, I'm going to be using Docker

72
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:07.001
and I will be providing you a scripts

73
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.002
that will start up the Docker image

74
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:12.001
as well as load the database.

75
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:15.002
Docker is not a requirement.

76
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm using Docker because I have students

77
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
with many different operating systems

78
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.009
and many different levels of understanding.

79
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.003
And Docker gives me a clean and easy way

80
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:27.006
for everyone to be using the same

81
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.001
exact database on their machine,

82
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.002
regardless of where it is.

83
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:33.002
That being said,

84
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:35.004
if you don't want to deal with Docker,

85
00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:39.004
you are free to use Postgres in many different ways.

86
00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:41.008
There are vendor installation instructions

87
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.002
to install Postgres on your machine,

88
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:48.004
as well as Docker if you don't already have it running.

89
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:52.000
There are those native install operations for Postgres.

90
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.009
So that is definitely an option.

91
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.000
There's also people who have access

92
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.009
to a remote instance of Postgres

93
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.004
that their company may allow them to use,

94
00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:05.002
or they have access to a cloud-based Postgres database

95
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:08.004
through AWS or GCP or Azure.

96
00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:10.002
And those all will work fine.

97
00:04:10.002 --> 00:04:12.005
All that matters here is that you have access

98
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:16.000
on your machine in some way, shape or form

99
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.002
to a Postgres database,

100
00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:22.008
via a local, via in Docker, or via the cloud.

101
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:25.006
Now, finally, I want to talk about an IDE.

102
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:29.003
And while an IDE is definitely a personal suggestion

103
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.001
that you have, the reality is you don't need

104
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.003
to have an IDE for this course.

105
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:36.003
It will make your life easier.

106
00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:37.003
The important thing though

107
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:40.001
is if you are going to use an IDE,

108
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.004
any IDE that supports Java will work.

109
00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:46.006
I'm going to be using IntelliJ Ultimate Edition

110
00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:48.001
because those are the tools

111
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.000
that I use every day in my job

112
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.004
and they're what I'm more comfortable with.

113
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:54.005
By no means do you have to use

114
00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:57.009
the same IDE that I am using.

115
00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.005
Any quality Java IDE will have Spring focus plugins,

116
00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:05.002
whether it's Eclipse or anything else.

117
00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:07.009
You are definitely encouraged to use

118
00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.003
those plugins in this course.

119
00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:12.005
I'm going to be using the ones that come native

120
00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:15.004
to IntelliJ Ultimate Edition.

121
00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:16.008
As I said, I'm going to be using

122
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:19.003
the JetBrains IntelliJ Ultimate Edition,

123
00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:21.007
but there is a community edition

124
00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:24.004
that doesn't have as robust plugins,

125
00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:27.003
but STS, Eclipse are all free

126
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:29.009
and all readily available.

127
00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.003
The most important thing about an IDE

128
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:35.000
is that you are comfortable with it.

129
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.007
That is far more important than the branding

130
00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:39.008
of the IDE itself.

131
00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:41.008
Whenever you are writing software,

132
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:44.003
your IDE is your toolbox.

133
00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:46.007
That is where you do all of your work.

134
00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:49.007
It is far more important that you are comfortable

135
00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:51.006
in the tool you are using

136
00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:54.009
than try to mimic exactly what I am doing.

137
00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.006
I will use shortcuts in my IDE.

138
00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:59.009
Those shortcuts exist in some way,

139
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.000
shape or form in every single IDE that exists today.

140
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.009
So again, don't get tied up as much

141
00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.005
on what I'm doing with the tool,

142
00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:11.000
learn how to do it in the tool

143
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that you are most comfortable with.
