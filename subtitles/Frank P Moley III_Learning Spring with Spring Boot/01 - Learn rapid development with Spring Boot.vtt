00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Frank] Whether you are writing internet applications

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.007
or enterprise applications targeting the JVM,

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:10.007
there is no question that Spring is the premier framework

4
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.009
for doing this type of work.

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.006
Spring offers a rich set of abstractions

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.002
that allow developers to focus on the business needs

7
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.008
and not on the needs of the infrastructure

8
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:23.007
or your integrations.

9
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:25.008
This gives developers speed to market,

10
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.009
as well as the ability to quickly iterate on functionality.

11
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.006
The power of Spring doesn't stop there.

12
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.007
It continues with a robust community

13
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.006
filled with knowledgeable and friendly developers

14
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.008
that are more than willing to offer insights

15
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.008
to those still learning

16
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.001
or seasoned veterans that are stuck.

17
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.009
And we all get stuck.

18
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.006
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

19
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm a software architect,

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.004
developer, teacher, and perpetual student.

21
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.004
I have been involved with the Spring community

22
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:55.005
for over 12 years

23
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.007
and solved many hundreds of real world problems

24
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.005
using this framework.

25
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.000
In this course,

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.005
we will use the widely popular Spring Boot framework

27
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.008
as a backdrop for learning about Spring,

28
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:09.008
how it works,

29
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:11.009
and how to use that knowledge

30
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.004
to build on it for more complex workloads.

31
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.001
Buckle up because over the next couple hours,

32
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.009
we will touch a large part of the Spring ecosystem

33
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.005
to help you build a solid foundation

34
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.000
for using the Spring framework.
