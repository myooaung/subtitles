(upbeat music)

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.003
- [Instructor] So now it's time

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:10.000
for our first challenge video of the course.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.008
And in this case,

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.002
you are going to add some additional repositories

6
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.005
to our project.

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.001
So here is your challenge.

8
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:19.009
First and foremost,

9
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.008
you are going to implement repositories

10
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:26.000
for our guests and reservation tables.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.002
Be sure you create the entity objects

12
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:32.009
so that you can use them with those repository interfaces.

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.009
You can leverage the schema.sql file and src/main/resources

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:41.005
for the table data you will need for your entity objects.

15
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:43.000
And finally,

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.004
you need to make sure that on the reservation entity,

17
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:50.000
I want you to add a method to get the reservations

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.008
for a given date.

19
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:52.009
And I haven't showed you that.

20
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.002
So that's going to be something you're going to have

21
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.002
to go look at spring data.

22
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.000
But I'm going to give you a hint.

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.007
The name is all that really matters.

24
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:05.002
Making sure that the name matches is what you need to do.

25
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:06.003
Now in the next video,

26
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:10.000
I will show you my solution to this problem.
