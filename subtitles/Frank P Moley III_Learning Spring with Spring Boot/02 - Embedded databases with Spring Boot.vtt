00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] We are now going to configure

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.005
an embedded database that we can use

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.003
throughout this course.

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.004
So the first thing I was like you to do

5
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.003
is go ahead and open up your IDE.

6
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.002
And you'll notice in the exercise files for this course,

7
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:18.002
that I've given you a data.sql and a schema.sql

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.001
that are in the bin directory.

9
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:25.001
I'd like you to copy those into source main resources,

10
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.009
just at the root folder there.

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.009
So take a look at the data file as well as the schema file.

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.003
And you'll see that I create some tables.

13
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.005
We also have the data file that inserts that data

14
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.003
into the tables.

15
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:41.000
And we'll use that later on throughout this course.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.006
Now, the next thing that we need to do

17
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.000
is we need to open up the pom.xml file,

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.008
and we're going to add a couple of dependencies to it.

19
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.000
So the first one that we are going to add

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.002
is spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.

21
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.004
And that comes from org.springframeworkboot.

22
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.006
You do not need a version

23
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:05.002
because the parent pom will take care of that for you.

24
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.008
And the next one that we need to add is the h2-database.

25
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:14.004
And that comes from com.h2database.

26
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.002
And now I'm going to run a Maven command

27
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.009
to import these resources.

28
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.009
Now we're almost done to the point

29
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.003
that we can actually use this database

30
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.000
because a couple more values that we need to put.

31
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.001
This time I want you to open up

32
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.002
the application.properties file

33
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.001
in source main resources.

34
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.004
And the first one that we are going to add

35
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:41.005
is logging.level.org.springframework-

36
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:53.000
jdbc.datasource.init.scriptUtils.

37
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.004
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to

38
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.005
set this equal to debug by default,

39
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.001
as of about springboot-2.3 maybe.

40
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.008
What we saw was they moved what used to be info messages

41
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.008
into debug messages.

42
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.005
So we need to set the logging level of our scriptUtils

43
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.008
to debug so we can actually see

44
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.008
what goes on during start up.

45
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.000
We would never do this in a production instance.

46
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.005
It's only so you can visualize what's going on.

47
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.002
Now, the other thing that we need to add

48
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:28.007
is spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto.

49
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.003
And we need to set that equal to none.

50
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:32.009
Now, the reason we're doing that is

51
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.000
because we've already applied a schema

52
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to our embedded database and populated it with data.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If we don't set none here and we ran our application,

54
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.009
it would go ahead and import the schema and the data

55
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.006
via the scriptUtils.

56
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:49.007
But then hibernate would take over

57
00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:53.004
and remove those data tables and add new ones

58
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.007
based on the fact that it believes

59
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.006
it's controlling the schema.

60
00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:00.001
So by setting ddl-auto to none,

61
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.008
we're going to tell hibernate, don't create the schema.

62
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:06.006
We've got it handled, just connect to the database.

63
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.000
Now that is it.

64
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.006
That's all we need to embed a database into our application.

65
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.002
So I want you to go ahead and run this.

66
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:15.009
And I have this run command,

67
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.004
as you've seen me click on my IVE.

68
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:22.003
You may need to do a Maven Clean Package and then do a run,

69
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:25.000
or you may need to run the main file.

70
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.007
It just depends on your IDE.

71
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:31.006
But I'm going to go ahead and click this.

72
00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:32.009
And what we're going to look at is

73
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.002
we're actually going to look at the console output

74
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:37.006
of our running application.

75
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:39.002
So if we scroll back up to the top,

76
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:40.004
you'll see the spring banner.

77
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:44.001
We're running springboot-2.5.6.

78
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:48.004
You can see that Tomcat has been initialized on port 8080.

79
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.007
And then we get down into this Hikari pool.

80
00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:53.008
So it's set up a Hikari data source,

81
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.006
meaning that thread pooling is turned on

82
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.009
and it is going to execute a script.

83
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.007
And the first script that it execute

84
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:04.003
is called schema.sql, and that's by convention.

85
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.004
In there, it builds the three tables,

86
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:10.000
does some ultra tables and creates an index for us

87
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.001
that we will use throughout this course.

88
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.003
It then goes through and runs the data.sql file.

89
00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:20.004
And in this file, I am simply embedding a whole bunch

90
00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:23.003
of data into our database.

91
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:25.003
So at this point, we're pretty confident

92
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:29.000
that we have data running that we can use.

93
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.009
And that's what we're going to build off of,

94
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.000
in the next video.
