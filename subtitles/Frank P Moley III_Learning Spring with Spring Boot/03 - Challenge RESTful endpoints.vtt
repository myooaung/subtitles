00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.001
- [Instructor] So now it's time

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.007
for a final challenge exercise for this course.

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:13.002
This time, you're going to write a few of your own end points

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.002
in our ReSTful web service.

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.006
So here's the basic requirements for this challenge.

7
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.005
First of all, you're going to expose a service

8
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.000
that lists all of our guests

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.001
and you're also going to expose a service

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.008
that allows a guest to be added to the list.

11
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:34.001
Both of those APIs will respond at API guests.

12
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.002
Now, the list should be a get call,

13
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.008
the add should be a post call.

14
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.005
You're also going to expose a service

15
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:46.006
that lists our rooms at api/rooms.

16
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.009
You are going to wire all of these

17
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.005
through our ReservationService.

18
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:52.008
And that's all there is to it.

19
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.003
Now, you're going to stretch yourself a little bit,

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.006
'cause I haven't shown you how to do a post body,

21
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.005
but I think you can handle it by reading the documentation

22
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.007
if you need to.

23
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.000
It's not that far different from doing a get

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.004
with the RequestParam.

25
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.007
You've just got a RequestBody now

26
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.000
instead of a RequestParam.

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.007
But play with it and see what you can do

28
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.000
and I'll be around next to show you my solution.
