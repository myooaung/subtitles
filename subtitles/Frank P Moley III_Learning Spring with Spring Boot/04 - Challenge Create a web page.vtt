(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.001
- [Narrator] So now it's time

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.003
for our next challenge exercise,

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.008
this time building a webpage.

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.006
The requirements of this challenge are as follows.

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.002
You are going to create a new page to show all guests

7
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.007
that we have in our system.

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.004
You are going to show the last name, the first name,

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:27.006
the email address, and the phone number in a table view,

10
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.000
much like we did for our room reservations.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.008
You need to respond at /guests.

12
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.000
You need to have a controller, a view,

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.007
a model, and service injection.

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.008
Now, I'm going to recommend

15
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.009
that you keep the service injection the way it is today

16
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.009
and simply add a method

17
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.007
to get all guests in the system there.

18
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.000
That's traditionally how we might build such a system,

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
even though it's pass through,

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but you are welcome to just inject the guest repository

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if that is what you choose to do.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But, regardless,

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'll be back in the next video to show you my solution.
