00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Frank] As our course comes to an end

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.002
I wanted to share with you a recap and some next steps

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:08.002
for your journey with the Spring framework.

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.008
Let's start with that recap.

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:14.003
So we have been using Spring Boot as a mechanism

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:18.003
to learn the basics of the Spring framework.

7
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.008
We started our journey with Spring data

8
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.006
and loaded an embedded database,

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.008
as well as a remote database and repositories

10
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.007
that we could use as an ORM to get data

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.008
out of our database with very little, if any, code.

12
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.000
We also leveraged the IoC container

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.001
to inject dependencies into upstream classes.

14
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:44.000
We built a web page using the Spring framework,

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.001
and then you built one on your own

16
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.000
so that you could see not only how to collect the data

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.002
in a controller,

18
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.008
but expose it out through a time leaf based template

19
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.004
of that web page.

20
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.008
And finally, we built some ReSTful webservices,

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.004
as well as one in the challenge

22
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.002
where you had to start at the top

23
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.007
and build everything all the way down the stack

24
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.008
including the data access.

25
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.008
That should have given you a very easy to use

26
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.003
and basic model of the Spring framework

27
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:15.007
so that you could start building

28
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.007
on that in your own knowledge journey.

29
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:22.004
Now, there are some very good next steps that you can take

30
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.007
to expand your use of the Spring framework.

31
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:26.007
First thing I would do

32
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.001
is recommend you start building small apps,

33
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.009
even small projects that only have one or two methods.

34
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.003
The idea being that if you see a problem

35
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.009
and you can solve it, no matter how small with the language,

36
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.007
you will start committing that knowledge

37
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.002
into your long-term memory.

38
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.002
In my GitHub repo, for instance,

39
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.006
you will find a lot of little kata,

40
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:53.004
K A T A programs that I write

41
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.009
that helped me reinforce constructs

42
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.006
with any language or with any framework.

43
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.008
I'm going to encourage you to walk through the projects

44
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:05.003
themselves within the Spring framework,

45
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.008
at least read the opening paragraph or two

46
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.004
of each of the documentation sets

47
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.000
so that you can get a little bit more deep knowledge

48
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.006
of what they do

49
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:18.000
outside of the brief introduction I gave you.

50
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.002
And of course there are many more courses,

51
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.002
many of which I have created

52
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.003
in the LinkedIn Learning library,

53
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:29.004
that you can use to expand your knowledge of Spring.

54
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:33.003
Now, I want to end this with a very important, thank you.

55
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:37.002
I appreciate the fact that you have spent this time with me

56
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.007
to learn from me of the knowledge that I've gained

57
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.009
from others and I don't take that lightly.

58
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:48.003
My commitment to you does not end when this course is over.

59
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:52.001
You will find me on Twitter, GitHub and Stack Overflow

60
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:56.005
at @fpmoles and I'm very active in all of those places,

61
00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:58.000
answering questions

62
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or talking about the latest and greatest in technology.

63
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.006
I also encourage you to use the Q and A section

64
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:06.004
here on LinkedIn Learning.

65
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:08.009
I find myself answering students questions

66
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:14.003
much more often on the Q and A section than any other place,

67
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:18.003
because I have more focus in that Q and A section.

68
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.003
But however you need to, you are free to reach out to me.

69
00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:22.008
And if it's something I can help you with

70
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.009
related to one of these courses,

71
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.001
I'm more than happy to do so.

72
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:28.007
Again, thank you for your time.

73
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.004
And I look forward to spending more of it with you

74
00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:34.000
on one of my other courses here in the library,
