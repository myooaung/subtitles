00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] We have just enough groundwork at this point

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.005
to start a new project.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.001
So let's do that using the Spring Initializr.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.001
Now there are several ways

5
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.009
to start a spring boot application,

6
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.005
and while start.spring.io, or the Spring Initializr,

7
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.007
isn't my preferred choice,

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:21.004
it is the most universal way of doing this.

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:22.005
For the rest of this course,

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.008
if I create an application,

11
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to use an ID plugin

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.006
that leverages the web service that backs this page,

13
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:34.000
but for now let's just fire up a browser and get started.

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The first thing that we're going to do

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.006
is we're going to navigate to start.spring.io.,

16
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:43.009
and you'll see that this fires up the Spring Initializr.

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.003
Now, we're going to be offered several options here

18
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:47.009
to go through.

19
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.006
First, under Project we will pick Maven Project.

20
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:56.002
Then for Language we are going to select Java.

21
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.005
Now, when we get down to Spring Boot,

22
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.002
we're going to be presented with several versions.

23
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.002
Now your version list may look a little bit different

24
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.001
based on when you watch this video,

25
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.000
but this course is designed for the 2.X line,

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.002
so we're going to pick the most recent 2.X line

27
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.005
that is past release candidate,

28
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:22.000
which at this point in time is 2.5.6.

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.008
Now, we will enter in a group,

30
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:26.005
and if you've ever done Maven development for Java,

31
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.006
this should all look very familiar.

32
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:33.009
So I'm going to do com.frankmoley.lil for LinkedIn Learning,

33
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.001
and we will then

34
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:41.005
create an artifact called learning-spring,

35
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.000
and the name is fine.

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.002
We don't need to put in a description or anything like that.

37
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.004
What we have is perfectly sufficient.

38
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.003
We are going to package this as a Jar file.

39
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:53.001
And as I mentioned,

40
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.003
we're going to use Java 17.

41
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.006
Now, if you need to use Java 11,

42
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:58.007
perfectly fine.

43
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.009
All of the examples will work under Java 11.

44
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.007
I'm just choosing 17 because that's the most recent

45
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:07.007
that isn't a long-term release.

46
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.009
Now we need to pick some dependencies to add.

47
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.008
So up here I'm going to select Add Dependencies,

48
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.001
and I'm going to type in Web.

49
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:15.009
And for right now,

50
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.000
that's the only dependency that we are going to add,

51
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.003
but I encourage you to look through this list

52
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:22.006
because later in the course,

53
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:26.001
we will be adding things that could be added now

54
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.003
through this list.

55
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.006
Once that is all entered,

56
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.004
I'm going to to click Generate.

57
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:36.000
And my machine is going to take the zip file

58
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.002
that was just created,

59
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:41.004
and download it into my Downloads Directory.

60
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:45.005
So what I am now going to do is open up a terminal window.

61
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.002
I'm going to go unzip that file.

62
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.001
So I'm going to go to my Downloads folder,

63
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:56.001
and I'm going to simply unzip learning-spring.

64
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.000
Now, the way I am going to do this

65
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.003
is I'm going to actually copy the files

66
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.005
and not the directory itself.

67
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:06.000
So I will navigate into learning-spring,

68
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.004
and I'm going to copy recursively everything

69
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.004
into the location where I'm going to do all of my development.

70
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.002
In this case,

71
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:19.000
it's in my code directory learning-spring.

72
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.007
So now if I navigate there,

73
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:27.001
you will see I have a structure.

74
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:28.009
Now yours may look a little bit differently.

75
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.004
I've got this one set up for get

76
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:32.004
because that's how I do my development.

77
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:34.001
You may not have the get folder,

78
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.009
but you will have get ignore.

79
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.001
You will have a help file.

80
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:38.005
You will have some Maven files

81
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:43.000
that come with spring boot initializr as it comes up.

82
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.007
Now I don't usually check those files into source control,

83
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:49.001
and they won't be included in the exercise files itself.

84
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.001
So if you need them,

85
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:53.008
you're going to have to keep them on your side.

86
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:54.008
Now what we're going to do

87
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:56.009
is I want to show you the power of this download

88
00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:01.008
and that we can actually run this it exists today.

89
00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:06.002
So if I go here and type maven package,

90
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:08.003
and allow it to run,

91
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:10.000
it's going to do a whole bunch of downloads

92
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.007
and then build this package.

93
00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:14.006
So once it's done,

94
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:17.003
you should see a build success.

95
00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.004
Now later on we're going to actually add some value

96
00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:20.005
to this application,

97
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:21.004
but for right now,

98
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:25.007
let's just type java dash jar in the target directory.

99
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:30.009
We want to run learning spring jar file.

100
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.001
So now I have a JVM running,

101
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:35.008
on port 80 80 Tomcat has started,

102
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:39.002
and if I go back to my web browser

103
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:42.005
and I go to local host 80 80,

104
00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:46.001
you will see that I get a Whitelabel Error Page with a 404.

105
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.002
Now this is actually coming out of Tomcat.

106
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:51.005
We have not configured an error page,

107
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:54.000
nor have we configured an index page,

108
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.003
but you can see that Tomcat is running

109
00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:59.009
and has yielded a 404.

110
00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.006
Now that's all we're going to do in this video,

111
00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:04.003
but we have an application that runs

112
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.000
that has a whole bunch of dependencies

113
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that we're going to check out in the next video.
