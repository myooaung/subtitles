00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Of all the projects in Spring,

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.009
outside of the core framework itself, Spring Security,

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.004
in my opinion, is the hardest to learn,

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.008
yet it's one of the most common that you will encounter

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.007
in your day-to-day activities.

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.003
So what is Spring Security

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.008
other than a simple security framework, you may ask?

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.005
It is specifically a filter-based authentication

9
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.000
and authorization framework.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.001
This can be things like Basic Auth, OAuth, SAML,

11
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.004
or other authentication and authorization frameworks.

12
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:38.003
Spring Security also is a web-based exploit prevention

13
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.002
and it's preventing things like CSRF,

14
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.003
or Cross-Site Request Forgery, that is built

15
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.002
into the Spring Security package.

16
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.002
Part of this exploit prevention includes things

17
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.009
like encrypted secure headers and TLS support.

18
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.005
Spring Security also has a robust library

19
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.003
of quote unquote "plugins"

20
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.002
for utilizing various technologies like LDAP

21
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.002
and other mechanisms.

22
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.006
Now, I have an entire course dedicated

23
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:11.006
to Spring Security called Spring, Spring Security,

24
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.007
and it would be a great starting point

25
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.007
if you want to dig into Spring Security

26
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.008
before you see it in the wild, assuming you haven't already.

27
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.001
It will get into much deeper knowledge

28
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.004
of how to configure and run an application using Security,

29
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.008
both the authentication aspects

30
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:33.002
as well as the authorization to individual methods

31
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:35.000
within your application.
