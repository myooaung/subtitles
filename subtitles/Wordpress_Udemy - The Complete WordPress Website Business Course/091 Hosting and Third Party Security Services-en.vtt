00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.830
In this video we'll look at the different systems hosting companies use to protect their servers against

2
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.300
We're dressed as a web site application which should have its own security measures while hosting companies

3
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.380
The applications installed on a server like Wordpress are usually the weakest link in security.

4
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.350
By the end of this video you'll have a good idea of what to look for in a hosting company as well as

5
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.920
installation itself.

6
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.650
In this video I'll go through my recommended hosting companies and we'll look at what WordPress dot

7
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.510
Hardening is typically a security term for making a web application more secure or hardening its outer

8
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.800
This is a great page to read at the Codex at Wordpress dot org.

9
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.280
It's called hardening WordPress.

10
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.490
I'm just going to go down and point out a couple of things.

11
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.270
This is basically impossible.

12
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.480
your web site but it limits bots and hackers and other attempts from getting in and compromising your

13
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.240
So there is a complicated dynamic as stated here between hosting companies and the security of your

14
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.230
One of the main points right here if you read this is that hosting companies make a certain amount of

15
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.810
have some different levels of security and we'll talk about which hosting companies do what but what

16
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.360
When you install WordPress on a hosting companies servers it is your responsibility to secure those

17
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.900
On top of what the hosting companies can do all of the Web hosting companies that I use and that I recommend

18
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.700
in this course use something called a web application firewall inside of their servers and their stack

19
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.590
where they host WordPress sites and this is basically a firewall between attempts at hacking and well-known

20
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.350
Between that and your Web site that's hosted on their services and hardware.

21
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.810
So site Ground employs a very common web application firewall that's an open source one called maade

22
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.590
It's a cross-platform open source web application firewall.

23
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.050
It enables the server to defen h TTP and HDTV as traffic against attacks.

24
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.930
It also allows them to implement specific advanced protections and create ones that are specifically

25
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:22.360
Flywheel has a more extensive security system and they have actually free malware removal if your site

26
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.350
does get hacked.

27
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.350
Are going to go in and fix it for free.

28
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:37.870
They use a service called security that they're partnered with in order to provide a third party Web

29
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.350
That's probably even more powerful than maade security and at cloud ways they also use a web application

30
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.220
And even though I've had more Bot traffic to manage in terms of slowing down my site at my cloud Waze

31
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.610
Web sites this has been a great secure platform and they do regularly patch the servers and they host

32
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.650
That's what a web application firewall does.

33
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.690
So if you're researching hosting companies for your sites or for your business I'd recommend you ask

34
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.690
Now an additional web application firewall or a layer of security that's provided by a third party that

35
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.500
out there.

36
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.870
Security at securty dot net is a great Web site security company and one of those services is a Web

37
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.080
You can see in their graphic here that they'll allow traffic to come into their network as well as potentially

38
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.210
spam sequel injections.

39
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.350
bad stuff and they'll balance the load and only send legitimate legitimate traffic towards your Web

40
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.580
They do that by altering the DNS and having you point your web site traffic from your domain name to

41
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.740
security first before it reaches your Web site.

42
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.230
Their service is a paid for service and it's probably the best out there for Wordpress CloudFlare is

43
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.170
Some of the most common types of attacks are called brute force attacks.

44
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:51.260
These are actually bots that come to your logon page and they set up services and bots to try and guess

45
00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.280
Now brute force attacks are the most common and one of the problems with these type of attacks is that

46
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.860
this is actual traffic that goes to your Web site and it can slow it down.

47
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.710
And so there's different ways of protecting your Web site against brute force attacks an unauthorized

48
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.340
logging and attempts that might slow down your site and actually eat up your bandwidth as well making

49
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.980
your server space and potentially your hosting cost more.

50
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.870
We'll look at these next type of protections in the next video when we look at security plug ins for

51
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.910
I encourage you to do your own research to find out what you can about security at the server you choose

52
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.740
There's some great information at Wordpress dot org on hardening WordPress as well as brute force attacks.

53
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.700
Right here this is a great page to read for yourself and I'd recommend checking out CloudFlare and security

54
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.600
with their web site application firewalls.

55
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:07.950
And then if you do use a hosting company like site ground and flywheel and cloud ways you know you're

56
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.760
In this lesson you learn how your hosting company should provide some level of security filtering in

57
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.920
Plus we won over some third party services you can add to further harden your server space against attacks

58
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.520
in the next video.

59
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.640
We'll look at several security plug ins for Wordpress so that you can block the most common areas of

60
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.200
Plus you can use these plug ins to monitor the traffic to your site continuing to improve your site's
