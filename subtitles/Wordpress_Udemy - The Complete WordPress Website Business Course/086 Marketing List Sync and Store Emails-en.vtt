00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.180
In this video you'll finish your customisations of the woo commerce web store by adding a marketing

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.840
email list synchronization and you'll customize the look and feel of the transactional emails that newcomers

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.600
and wordpress will send to subscribers and customers who buy products and sign up for the free download

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.790
by the end of this video you'll have made the changes necessary to make your e-commerce store the best

5
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.690
So back in our web store.

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.950
Let's make sure we have the Wordpress dashboard open.

7
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:50.070
for Wordpress plugin activated and set up for using a Sign-Up form for your MailChimp lists.

8
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.590
last chapter.

9
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.000
For me I'm still connected with the same web site and so my MailChimp API settings are still here and

10
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.650
All we have to do is under MailChimp for W.P. go down and click integrations in their menu item on the

11
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.690
And now that we have a Wu comer's web store activated the newcomers check out link is now activated

12
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.550
under the available integration section.

13
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.060
So just click with comer's check out and up at the top under enabled just click yes and then you have

14
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.230
That gives the user the option to check or uncheck the box when they become a newcomer's customer on

15
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.540
list that is appropriate.

16
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.770
And then we could just leave the default here.

17
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.430
You can have that checkbox pre-selected which is a great idea.

18
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.930
We don't need to load any CSSA restyling for now.

19
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.900
And yes it's a good idea as we had discussed it in the last chapter to use male chimps double opt in

20
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.630
Now really that is all there is to it.

21
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.650
Now if you make a test here if you go and say you wanted to go down and let's go where we had been before

22
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.480
that free product let's go down to that free product let's add it to the cart.

23
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.050
Great my system is still working.

24
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.370
Sends me directly to the checkout page.

25
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.850
And then maybe I'll use one of my testing email addresses right here.

26
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.120
you can choose whether to do that or not but now if I place order it's got order received.

27
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.370
And here's my download if I need it and I should also receive an e-mail about this order and we'll be

28
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.630
And this video as well but now I'm going to go up to my MailChimp account and let's just go to MailChimp

29
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.730
And you should be following along and doing the same thing within your MailChimp and your Wordpress

30
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.990
accounts.

31
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.520
my dashboard there.

32
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.140
I'm going to look at my particular lists and I'll choose this list and I know that I had erased all

33
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.870
dot com email address.

34
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.140
And can you guess why.

35
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.870
Well it's because I haven't opted in yet.

36
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.410
Nobody will join your list if you're using the double opt in system until they confirm their e-mail

37
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.680
So I've gone into my email program and I received an e-mail at that e-mail address from MailChimp.

38
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.390
Here's my standard confirm subscription email and if I click yes subscribe me to this list that will

39
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.730
thank you page and it's got my little free download right there from our old mailing system.

40
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.410
But now if I go back to my MailChimp list and refresh the page I should have two subscribers now.

41
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.640
And there they are this number still says one but if you look down here in the list there is the e-mail

42
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.880
So that's great.

43
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.350
their email address will go straight to the MailChimp list get a double opt in and when they confirm

44
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.110
they'll join the MailChimp list.

45
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.430
e-mail that we're going to customize.

46
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.820
This is a customer e-mail and this is the standard layout that will comer's uses in the plugin to send

47
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.940
What we'll do is change the color to match whatever the brand coloring might be for your client or your

48
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.390
Let's get into it.

49
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.400
Back in the Wordpress dashboard I'm going to go back into newcomer's and then the settings page go ahead

50
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.540
And we'll check out how to customize those outgoing e-mails that the web store will send to customers

51
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.360
over on the right hand side of all of the settings tabs.

52
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:25.860
notifications all the different types of notifications that might get sent to a customer.

53
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:35.040
And now these are actually THP templates that will go out to customers or even out to owners of the

54
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.170
And these e-mail templates are determined through a PH file.

55
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:52.040
This is housed within newcomer's and you can see right down here the H.T. mail template is AICC a template

56
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.580
that's APHC file within the newcomers plug in.

57
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.210
But just like we did before with our will comer's overriding code as well as when we worked with child

58
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.810
You can override and replace this e-mail template by making a new file called Whatever It Is dot ph

59
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.250
So here is a copy of it.

60
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:25.490
I I just clicked view template right here and you can see that the instructions are here.

61
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:32.580
Copy this to this folder right here your theme and then the newcomers folder and then an emails folder

62
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.840
and admin.

63
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.820
Drop DHP.

64
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:43.620
In this case that's how you change the wording on any of these customer e-mails that will go out and

65
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.470
And if you notice there's actually a button that can automatically copy the file to the appropriate

66
00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:01.650
So if you just hit copy file to theme it gives you a message says that this template has now been overridden

67
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:12.180
So you can use FCP or the file manager to go into your server find that BHP file and open it in a text

68
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.900
these e-mail notifications.

69
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.510
Any of these e-mails go out to the customer.

70
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:31.320
Now if I go back to my e-mail program Here's my e-mail that came to me as a customer when I ordered

71
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:43.350
If I wanted to edit things that are said right here or add some other marketing copy or anything else

72
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:56.280
So back in the Wordpress dashboard Let's see I believe this is the completed order e-mail template and

73
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:03.440
it is your order is complete is the e-mail so your blank order from this date is complete.

74
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.710
Let's see if that's the proper e-mail that we're looking for.

75
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.370
Yeah.

76
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.850
file you'll see it says download your files.

77
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:23.610
So this template should say hi there your recent order on name of store has been completed.

78
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:29.510
So let's go back into here and let's view this template here.

79
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.240
As we look you go down here.

80
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.690
Here it is here's the text.

81
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:40.020
Your recent order on this is the web store has been completed and all that stuff.

82
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:47.760
Let's go back up and let's look at the second section under e-mails tab.

83
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.030
It says e-mail sender options.

84
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.620
This is where it's coming from.

85
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.010
And then your e-mail template.

86
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.940
Here's what we're going to edit in this video to make that email look just a little bit better but still

87
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:08.490
If you just click click here to preview your email template it will open another tab and it'll just

88
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.820
Here's a slightly rounded corners.

89
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.020
A certain muted blue color and that's what the copy looks like.

90
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.190
And then there's some footer text down here at the bottom as well.

91
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.790
This would be a U or L for a logo image that you could put inside of the e-mail header so you could

92
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.050
The logo for example.

93
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.970
Here's a logo image.

94
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:57.130
It's just 240 by 120 a nice small image from my desktop in the brochure site that we had made before.

95
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.780
So I'm going to upload that to the media library.

96
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.020
And now how to get the URL for it.

97
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.010
If I click that little edit button or I go back into the media library and find that image and click

98
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.370
Here's the file you are l for that image.

99
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.880
So I'll just select all that text and hit Control C for copy.

100
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:27.850
And now I'm just going to go back to my woo'd commerce settings page under the email tab right up here.

101
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:35.180
And then of course back down here to my e-mail template now if I just click there and hit Control V

102
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.010
I'm pasting that logo image directly into that e-mail file.

103
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.520
Then here's the footer text.

104
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:48.110
You know I could change the color just by putting a new Let's see just make it a little bit brighter

105
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.370
How about that.

106
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.960
And the body text.

107
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.530
Let's go ahead and let's make it just I don't know.

108
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.980
This is just a great let's make it a little darker.

109
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:07.030
How about straight black so it's really readable close to black anyway so save changes.

110
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:15.440
And now the emails that I get from making a transaction with it in the store should have that logo a

111
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.770
So what if I go back to let's see let's go back home again.

112
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.100
And I'm just going to go to let's see to the second page of the web store.

113
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.220
It's time.

114
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:43.120
Let's see if you know I'll just leave the same e-mail address there.

115
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.440
This time I won't sign up for the newsletter but if I place this order in fact you know what I'll do

116
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.360
If I hit place order I should get an order received page.

117
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.610
There it is.

118
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.200
And then up in my e-mail.

119
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.700
All right.

120
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:07.290
I went back to my e-mail and I checked that I received a new message from the newcomers store which

121
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:14.880
I opened it up here in a tab and you can see that here's the logo image that I had uploaded and referenced

122
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.540
and the color here is a little bit darker.

123
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.360
Great.

124
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.500
I was able to edit that and it's an excellent e-mail.

125
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.050
or the lettering for the store the name of the web store.

126
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:47.610
That would be a great way to brand these e-mails that go out to your customers in this lesson you customize

127
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.740
to e-mail systems that your web store uses.

128
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.500
get the option to join the MailChimp email list.

129
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:13.120
Congratulations you've created an e-commerce store using open source software Wordpress and commerce
