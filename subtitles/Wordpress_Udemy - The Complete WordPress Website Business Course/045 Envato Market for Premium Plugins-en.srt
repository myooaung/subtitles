00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,050
In this video we'll look at a large proven marketplace for premium plug ins called in Vado the Advento

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,960
market has lots of different resources for sale by experienced designers programmers and developers

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,080
and wordpress plugins and themes make up a big part of the products their themed Forrest is enviro's

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,910
We'll explore the and Vado market and I'll show you how I've used in Vado to enhance my business with

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,810
First let's just take a look at the and Vado Web site.

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,710
It's NVI a teow dot com.

7
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:48,110
And over here on the right if you open up the little button it'll ask you what you want to do in Vado

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,900
the enviro market is what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:50,930 --> 00:01:02,000
They have a theme provider called theme forest and code Canyon is where I get my plug ins for wordpress.

10
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,560
Here's the code Kenion page.

11
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,840
At the end Vado market and I'll usually roll over WordPress.

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:16,650
If you click the Wordpress tab it'll open up 4400 WordPress plugins are in the repository.

13
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,520
They all cost a little bit of money and you can rate them just like you'd go through and rate a plug

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,510
You can look at how many downloads and look at the comments and some testimonials and how long the company's

15
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,880
been around and make a judgment whether the developers will be around in the future to support the plug

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,080
Now I'll usually narrow down my search within the Wordpress plugin results using this search bar right

17
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:54,440
For example maybe I want a fancy pop up because I've got a client who wants to build an email list and

18
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,720
form as a pop up for someone that browses to the Web site.

19
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:09,020
Looks like there's quite a few here and I can spot one in the top few that I've used before.

20
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,080
particular because I have experience with it.

21
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:27,820
One thing I like about the Vado market is your ability on any products page to look at the details very

22
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:35,110
There's always a live preview button that opens up a new window or a new tab where you can get a demo

23
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,030
provided by the developer of the plugin.

24
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,330
That was a cool one.

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:59,110
an animated fashion comes in maybe from the sides or from the top.

26
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,010
There's some animation which makes it quite interesting.

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,010
Here's a real cool one that I like

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,460
nice fill it out and if you close it or subscribe it drops off the bottom within this plug in a lot

29
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,560
pop up for a client or for your own sites.

30
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,940
Inside of a site that I made for a client I'm inside of the layered pop ups settings window with all

31
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,830
these choices.

32
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,760
And you can see that it comes with a whole bunch of sample pop ups the same block over here because

33
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:54,140
The one that I have activated is here and I went through and customized it with these settings.

34
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,340
here where you can have a lot of different settings for the pop up that you're making.

35
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,260
Back at the layered pop ups and Vado market page at Code Kanyon let's look at what we've got here.

36
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:23,670
It says five stars with a little bit of testimonial and they're able to do all these kinds of different

37
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,770
pop ups.

38
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,740
I look over here I've got almost seven sixty seven hundred sales with 4300 comments.

39
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,330
The overall rating out of 428 ratings is five stars.

40
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:45,840
That's making me pretty confident created in 2013 and updated not long ago and it it always tells you

41
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,470
give you some advertising about what it does.

42
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,660
And these are different e-mail servers e-mail providers that it can work with.

43
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,970
And I've just found that it's a really great product for not that much money.

44
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:16,960
So what if I wanted to shop for a different type of Wordpress plugin maybe I need.

45
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:26,710
Recently I've done a search and researched plug ins that I can use to make a contract in the if I search

46
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,090
And that's what I did search for before.

47
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,490
Here's one called W.P. online contract and looks like they've got a couple of add ons for some payment

48
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,270
I really just needed to have my client actually needed to have his clients be able to sign a contract

49
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,700
online downloaded as it PTF and have it keep inside his Web site on file so that he could access it

50
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:05,970
WP online contract was an excellent solution and I went through the process of just going through and

51
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,640
Looking at the buyer rating looking at when it was created and when it was last updated and I went ahead

52
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,460
I've said it before regarding WordPress themes.

53
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:36,280
But one of the best things about purchasing a premium product like a premium plug in here is that the

54
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,890
Keep it updated as Wordpress updates and give support when needed.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,850
One of the things I looked at with this plug in before I bought it was that I was able to go down here

56
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:58,490
and see some recent comments and they were all positive comments six days ago eight days ago 11 days

57
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,080
And so that gave me confidence that I can go ahead and give it a try and make it work for me.

58
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,210
Don't forget I've covered this in an earlier video but they are responsible for the theme for us to

59
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,810
And Vado market has.

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,730
and then you can search within these results.

61
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,810
The team that I went over earlier in the in this course and some other themes that I've used are excellent

62
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,330
And I've always had excellent service with and Vado and theme forest.

63
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,050
a newsletter every so often and an access to a monthly list of free files.

64
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,340
I've used these to great advantage and they're always doing holiday promotions and giving away free

65
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:20,280
pieces of design and plug ins and code and themes from different providers on an ongoing basis.

66
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:27,120
And so if you look at this and Vado market email I got last March I've got a response of Wordpress theme

67
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:42,900
panel WordPress plug in some audio and I don't use 3D modeling but if you did free files every month

68
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:51,360
they also do a lot of promotions where they'll do holidays and celebrations of new things coming up

69
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,120
once a month.

70
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,520
There's always some WordPress goodies in there and I think it's great to be on the Vado mailing list.

71
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,830
I think the best way to get on that list is to visit the resources page from students dot dot.

72
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,330
Of course dot com or from the link at the top left of your site dashboard in your sandbox and just go

73
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,580
If you create an Vado account then you'll get on their mailing list and you'll be able to get that free

74
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Another way to find their monthly free offerings is to go to any of their major brands theme forest

75
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,780
or code Canyon or any of the others.

76
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,570
And on the homepage of that brand you can scroll down.

77
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:54,140
And then here's the free months stuff from code Kenion graphic river theme forest.

78
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,810
Usually a lot of Wordpress themes there and I've used video hive projects as well.

79
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,040
In this video we checked out the end Vado market where plug ins themes and other great resources are

80
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,020
Sometimes however a free plug in might exist.

81
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,880
That's just the thing you need in the next video.

82
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,750
We'll go over how to decide on and rate plug ins and find the one you need in the free WordPress Dorward

83
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,170
plugin repository.

84
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:23,980
