00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.620
In this video we'll set up shipping options for your e-commerce store for digital and downloadable products.

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.120
Newcomers can manage the whole process.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.810
When someone buys a downloadable product like a PTF e-book a piece of software a video or audio file

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.250
or any digital item.

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.260
This whole process including log ins accounts and download permissions can be automated by the end of

6
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.710
You'll be able to set up Wordpress and newcomer's to manage sales of digital downloads including customer

7
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.210
Let's get started.

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.230
We're still going to be working inside of the newcomers store web site that we've been working on.

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.560
So make sure you have that site open in one tab and your Wordpress dashboard open in the other.

10
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.100
Let's go to that WordPress dashboard and open up with e-commerce and the settings panel.

11
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.600
Now we have a number of tabs across the top that we've gone over in previous videos.

12
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.640
in the settings.

13
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.010
The one that we've had set now is disable shipping and shipping calculations.

14
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.400
store.

15
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.010
This is what you would have selected.

16
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.400
And then it disables all shipping items from the front end and the back end selections of our site.

17
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.530
But if we opened that up and we could say ship to specific countries only or these are other two selections

18
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.510
But if let's just use shift to specific countries only and then you can choose a country here just by

19
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.580
starting to type the name.

20
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:58.220
I'm located in the United States so I select that and then I can just go down and choose the rest of

21
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.940
or mobile device is a really good way to do that.

22
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.950
And then we can either enable or disable taxes and tax calculations et cetera.

23
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.700
And so if we go down and save our changes with the new shipping selection you'll see that you have a

24
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.100
And let's set up some examples shipping options for your commerce setup.

25
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.400
So click the shipping tab and you'll see that there are three sub items underneath the shipping tab

26
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.130
shipping zones shipping options and shipping.

27
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.090
Classis of course you can read about any of these using these little question mark tool tips as well

28
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.990
For now we might add a shipping zone that just has our entire country just an offer one shipping zone

29
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.270
for the entire store.

30
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:16.540
So if the zone name is USA then we can select regions or limit to specific zip codes if we want to.

31
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.530
If I start typing United States I can just leave that as the whole region and then it doesn't have any

32
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.980
The rest of the world is actually another zone within there.

33
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:41.240
I'm going to save changes here and we can see that you can choose and drag your shipping zones and that's

34
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.490
and then you want to use different different shipping methods for each of those zones.

35
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.590
If you don't add a shipping method to a certain zone like this one in the rest of the world then that

36
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.490
But now we need to offer a shipping method to the zone that we've defined for the entire USA.

37
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.500
So maybe we can use flat rate or you can choose free shipping and that can actually be conditional on

38
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.890
a certain dollar amount being spent or even a coupon code or some other conditional element now that

39
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.200
that will open up our flat rate for the 1 shipping zone that we have called USA and we can then title

40
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.970
And so we need to use the same decimal amount and say we have $8 for shipping and click save changes.

41
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.780
Great now our settings have been saved and that shipping amount will be calculated for the customer

42
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.970
for every one of our products.

43
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.860
I've already set one flat rate shipping method to my USA zone and so now I'll add free shipping as a

44
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.270
second shipping method.

45
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.540
Now if I click my free shipping method link over here I can define what free shipping requires.

46
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.640
open choice.

47
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.080
But I can make it conditional on having a valid free shipping coupon a minimum order amount or a combination

48
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.180
So if I do a minimum order amount of say if somebody spends 100 dollars well then they'll get free shipping

49
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.580
and then I can advertise that let's click shipping options at the top.

50
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.270
we can enable a shipping calculator on the cart page which would enable a customer to calculate their

51
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.630
Now since we're going to be setting up just a flat rate shipping charge for the entire region or zone

52
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.490
we can uncheck the calculator and not have that on there.

53
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.990
choice for the store owner and we're going to be advertising that we have a flat rate shipping for the

54
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.940
Now the shipping destination you can see under this tool tip this controls which shipping address is

55
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.200
I think it's a good idea to default to the shipping address because sometimes that can be different

56
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.170
So just click Save changes and then we'll take a look at the next item the shipping classes.

57
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.520
You may not have to use shipping classes but if you roll over the tool tip you can see that they can

58
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.510
weight or if you have heavy items and you need to provide a different rate for that class of product

59
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.050
You might be able to do that to split your different flat rates into their shipping classes.

60
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.690
We'll just leave that alone for now.

61
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:27.790
So that's almost all there is to it in terms of setting the shipping for our entire store.

62
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.940
the cart and we can look at how the shipping is presented to the customer.

63
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.250
You can see that if you scroll down a little bit in the shopping cart the cart totals show subtil total

64
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.500
of shipping which is labeled flat rate and shows the cost.

65
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.980
And then it totals it.

66
00:07:52.990 --> 00:08:00.910
So if we proceed to checkout you can see that that has the flat rate amount detailed as well and it

67
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.660
and they can go on with their purchase from there.

68
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.690
But you can see that we've gone over all the settings you might have to do some different calculations

69
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:34.420
Let's quickly go back into the new settings and let's look at a particular product page so that we can

70
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.660
So if we look at this happy ninja product that we put in our car a moment ago if you look down under

71
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.610
and you can assign it to one of the shipping classes we discussed before.

72
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:06.700
And so with the shipping calculator depending on where the location of the person is and the weight

73
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.690
and the dimensions of the shipping box you can let Wu commerce decide how much to charge the customer.

74
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.680
While we're here on the product page.

75
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.130
Let's start talking about virtual and downloadable products.

76
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.010
Obviously if you're going to offer a download for somebody and have them purchase that item and have

77
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:37.350
And you can see right here under product data that there are two checkboxes virtual Prucha products

78
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.500
file upon purchase.

79
00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:01.790
that allows you to manage downloadable products and access to a file upon purchase.

80
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.420
It's very powerful.

81
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.230
And we'll go over setting up a digital e-commerce product right now.

82
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.800
Back on the products page.

83
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.650
How about this first one in the list.

84
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.960
Single number two.

85
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.750
And then we can test the downloading process as a customer.

86
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.860
So the first thing I'll do to set this product up as a digital and downloadable product is I'll scroll

87
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.870
the shipping option over on the left hand side because a virtual product is intangible and it's not

88
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.810
And then also click the downloadable box.

89
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.860
You can see that when I check that box down below this regular and the sale price items it gave me a

90
00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:02.220
So one thing we can do right here is add the file and I know that I have an image on my desktop that

91
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.090
store.

92
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.650
one file as a downloadable part of a single product.

93
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.120
And so we'll just add one file at this point.

94
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:28.200
I'll just call it new single too since that's the name of this product and you should also know that

95
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.390
somewhere else besides the Web site Media Library.

96
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:44.010
Newcomers will protect your files against downloading and offer them up only to customers who purchase

97
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.450
And in that way you can choose the media library or any you are l where you keep your files.

98
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:56.640
But I'll just click Choose file and now if I go to upload files and hit select file I'm going to go

99
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.270
And there's this large image and I can just hit open and that will upload it to that media library and

100
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:24.720
this product to download the file and you can also place a download limit for how many times you want

101
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:37.140
You can have this download link expire after a certain number of days if you like or you can just leave

102
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.830
and product in your website is listed in the search engine directories like Google.

103
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.970
Is it an application or software or a standard product.

104
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:04.380
Just so this is easy to test so that we can buy it without exchanging any money and check our downloading

105
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:11.430
So if down here if I just change the sale price to zero that'll show that it's on sale for free at the

106
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.590
Then I'll go and click the update button.

107
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:23.430
One more place we can go in the Wordpress dashboard for downloadable items and their settings is under

108
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.210
I've navigated to the general settings page and then under products.

109
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:39.240
This page just has a few items to choose from and the main one is the file download method.

110
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.100
Now there's three options here.

111
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.730
You can read a little bit about it using the tool tip here but there is a good document in the commerce

112
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.730
docs.

113
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.800
I searched for downloadable product and I found this link here.

114
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:57.320
You can read the link right here if you like in their documentation but it gives good information about

115
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.860
Basically what it's saying is that forced downloads uses ph at the server to serve the downloadable

116
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.250
item to the customer.

117
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:20.480
And if it's very large you might incur a timeout if you have large items like video files or audio files

118
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:27.590
in which case if your server has this mud installed the send file method is better.

119
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.260
Next you can check downloads require logging which is a good idea if you're in if you're having your

120
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.340
They can go to your Web site and go to their account page to click their download buttons for products

121
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.810
or whether they are accessible while the order is processing.

122
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.220
So with all of our downloadable items options set.

123
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:11.450
Let's go back to the web store front end and we'll look at our product and buy it as if we were a customer.

124
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.820
So I scroll down to the single number two.

125
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.150
First of all you can see it has a sale icon and the real price is crossed off.

126
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.410
And even though I put the numbers zero in the sale price it goes free with an exclamation point.

127
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:32.100
So I can click Add to Cart and then view cart looking at my cart I could see that the total is zero

128
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.090
And as we get on here cart totals are zero.

129
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:42.930
So I can proceed to the checkout and as I scroll down I'll need to put some required information here

130
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.400
just because these are required billing details even though the end result will be zero dollars.

131
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:55.130
And in a subsequent video we'll be learning how to not require all this billing info.

132
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:04.670
But for now I'll just fill this in the video for a second and be right back to place my order now that

133
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.840
I can click the place order button and it says order received.

134
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.070
And now this is the great part.

135
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.120
And these are my order details.

136
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.290
too.

137
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.020
That's my object that I can download.

138
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.910
And so what happens if I click that right now it knows that I'm logged in and it allows me to download

139
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.410
Great.

140
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.020
So let me cancel that.

141
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:55.470
And since I'm logged in as the customer I can go down to the third tab here and click downloads and

142
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.750
Here's the product page and it says how many how many remaining infinity and it never expires and here's

143
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:10.260
my download button again that's working to download the file that I defined within this product and

144
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.510
Once I click OK great.

145
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:25.990
If I open that and open a folder in Windows Explorer which is that downloads folder and there's large

146
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.500
image if I just double click it it'll show me what I've downloaded.

147
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.880
That was on sale for free.

148
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:41.650
But you can see how the downloading works for products that you can offer that are virtual products

149
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.090
and downloadable items.

150
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:50.920
If I'm not logged in in fact this is a good test right here inside of my account I can hit the logout

151
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:58.590
And now that I'm logged out if I go to my account I don't have any information here that I can get.

152
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:04.830
I need to be logged in in order to download my product.

153
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.090
that was placed.

154
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.600
I've got a new customer order it tells me what was ordered and the customer details and secondly the

155
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.100
Of course you can customize this e-mail template and we'll learn how to do that in a future video to
