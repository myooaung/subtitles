1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,030
In this video you'll select a different genesis theme and check out how the custom postdated created

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,850
We're not tied to a particular theme forever nor do we have to re-import the data created around the

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,290
You'll get a sense of the versatility of not only the author pro plug in but all custom post type plug

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,020
Let's start by going back to the Wordpress dashboard on the author pro theme that we've been working

5
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,510
our existing content.

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,980
Let's all do interior Pro.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,740
The reason I'm picking interior pro and I'll just hit activate is that in terms of the home page and

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,050
for book which is again across one of the widget areas and it'll show for across just like the author

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,860
Let's go back and look at our interior pro powerd site now.

10
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:25,600
OK I've got my my site open in another tab octaves right click and hit open in new tab.

11
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,200
OK you can see that I've got the interior theme look right here.

12
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,640
It's actually also have the interior theme demo open in another tab.

13
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,870
So we can compare our site to what the demo is supposed to look like Don't forget it's at Demo dot studio

14
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,370
And then the theme name.

15
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,050
This one is interior.

16
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,500
This is the site name.

17
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,140
And then here's a widget area that can have we have a widget area here it looks like here's a widget

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,910
And then there's a couple other areas.

19
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,120
And this one is the footer which contains three widgets.

20
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,740
And so we're going to customize the interior theme for our author pro web site.

21
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,670
Let's just take a look at what we have.

22
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,460
We've got this is one of our widget areas where we had a single widget I think that was down in the

23
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,090
And here's our books for widgets in the area across.

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,550
Looks great.

25
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:42,330
I think I can see that the plug in is taking care of some lay out items and fitting it into the interior

26
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,130
pro theme look and feel you can see the buttons look a little different.

27
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,490
Let's go down and look at the rest of the home page.

28
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,450
Here's our little about the author that we had put in the after entry area so we're going to rearrange

29
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,630
But let's take a look at a single book page as well and see that the plug has taken care of some of

30
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,460
It puts the image to the right hand side and this looks really good.

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,530
As you scroll down you can see that it's got the different custom fields data present Also and here's

32
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,000
one of the by buttons.

33
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,840
Looks great.

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,130
And then you can see these two areas the above the footer and the footer area are visible on every page

35
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,470
So there's a little bit to change here.

36
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,010
And here's your challenge for this video.

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,360
Back on the home page you can rearrange your home page or front page widgets into the widget areas to

38
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,390
widget area and the footer widget area.

39
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,850
You can go back to the interior pro theme demo to look at what that looks like.

40
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,720
Also you may want to take and make a change within your own site.

41
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,800
to keep that at the very bottom but somehow arranged that that is visible at the top along with this

42
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,490
So your challenge is to arrange your site with the existing content.

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,620
The home page and the footer and before footer widgets and see how you go puzzle video now and then

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
OK how how'd you do with that challenge.

45
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,320
That might have been a couple of trial and error items that you need to do there.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,290
But if I go back into the Wordpress dashboard one thing I know is that because I need to move these

47
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,540
items that I've already created between widget areas the custom.

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,610
Isn't that great at that.

49
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,430
and I can just drag them around and put them where I need them to be.

50
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,140
front page one from page 2 and front page 3.

51
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,990
And then of course I have the before footer and footer areas.

52
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,670
So if I have the footer Let's see I can just oh also this simple social icons that had been missing

53
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,370
So I'm going to go ahead and do that into the footer along with the recent posts widget into the footer

54
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,360
and I'll figure out a third widget to put into the footer area as well to make it like the demo.

55
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,740
I think this front page 2 widget area with its four featured book widgets looks good so I'm going to

56
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,590
This one is the about the author user profile which has the Gravatar and the connection to their bio

57
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,040
So I'm going to use that Genesys user profile widget.

58
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,890
Except this time I'm going to put it in the before footer.

59
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,950
Instead of having this text widget which I am and I just bring down and get rid of over here I'm going

60
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,150
feature posts.

61
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:35,120
So if I bring agenesis featured post widget over the front page three now just to show the most recent

62
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,690
of different thumbnail sizes to choose from.

63
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,760
And that reminds me.

64
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,330
This may have occurred to you hopefully you thought of it during your process but because we've changed

65
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,000
once again.

66
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:04,220
So for this one because this is part of a widget here we're going to show just the most recent blog

67
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,050
I want a nice big square front page square eight hundreds.

68
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,860
We know that from author pro 800 by 800 was one of the thumbnail images but these ones ape 800 by four

69
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,780
So I'll choose this one nonetheless.

70
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,160
Let's leave the image to the left and then the text on the right.

71
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:40,490
And let's show the content and we'll do the same we did before limit it to 300 characters and we can

72
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,410
That's fine.

73
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,760
And our Click Save Let's see in front page one I have just a single featured book.

74
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,760
Let's go and bring that over to the middle of the footer section.

75
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,900
That's where we had it before in our author pro theme.

76
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,230
Let's see if I go back to the sample you can see that in front page one this is like a big hero image

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,570
There's a button that links somewhere to the Web site.

78
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,050
Some large text and the title is right here.

79
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:26,240
So I'm just going to imitate that with a text widget back in my sample site here or the online version

80
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,040
So if I don't have a front page one widget in there it just uses the header image and goes straight

81
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,900
But I want to use from page 1.

82
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:45,050
So I'll place a text widget in here and I know that this theme is program to format the content a certain

83
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,700
and put that inside of that content.

84
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:11,550
The author's name that was brought in as a part of our ex-MIL import originally and have a scholar author

85
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,590
that's just going to be a small title at the top.

86
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:26,200
And then let's put that little button in there so we know that we need we need a link.

87
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:32,090
And this one is just connecting to us a page within this site.

88
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:43,600
Now back at the site the home page I know that if I go to the URL slash books I'll get the library grade

89
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:51,420
it shows three across and then it's paginate so that we can go to the next page.

90
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:00,690
Great so I might create a button that would be that you are in control C for copy and I'll just paste

91
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,240
OK.

92
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:10,110
So if I want this to be an anchor tag which is a button or a link I have to go a for anchor and the

93
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,540
a button.

94
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:29,100
So if I just do a space class equals quote button unquote and then the next thing I need to define in

95
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,740
This is the hyperlink reference equals quote.

96
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:46,930
And all I have to do is close that beginning tag and then right here I can type whatever I want.

97
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,300
Let's see this is going to be all books.

98
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,780
How about.

99
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:05,350
and greater than symbol so I have automatically add paragraphs and actually I mean to take out one of

100
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,950
I've hit save.

101
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,040
Let's see what our site looks like now.

102
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,070
Oops I'm not on the home page so we can see that it's using a any cursive font for our page title.

103
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,190
And great.

104
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,490
open that page.

105
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,780
Awesome.

106
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,500
And now I've got the content showing up.

107
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,580
So I have a little thumbnail image inside of the behind.

108
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,190
Let's go back and edit that widget just a little bit make that front page look all that much better.

109
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,190
We've got one featured post and they're showing the content.

110
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:08,500
That's where I had my error and I need to put 300 right here and I'll just say if Now if I go back and

111
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,960
That's quite huge.

112
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,380
and then see how it affects our page.

113
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:30,580
First of all I'm going to region thumbnails regenerate all the math and it will look at the theme and

114
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,470
OK now that all my thumbnails have been regenerated let's just go back to the home page and refresh

115
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:47,160
to see how that affects our home page especially where I have that featured post.

116
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,450
It's still quite a large image.

117
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,030
See if I just look at image info in Windows.

118
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,430
page.

119
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,800
featured image size thumbnail that's been created for me.

120
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:20,940
I need to go to front page 3 and featured posts that featured image from page Square.

121
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,360
What else do we have here.

122
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,860
That's a large one.

123
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,900
a nice size 400 tall but 800 wide

124
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,390
refresh the page here.

125
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:51,080
Oh that looks really nice with 300 characters and then the read more link that blog post looks good.

126
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,290
I've got the four footer area with my author information and three widgets in the footer.

127
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:11,200
Go back and address this primary sidebar and then maybe I'll go and edit this menu so that these are

128
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,380
So if I go into first of all check Genesis theme settings you know see it looks like yes I have sidebar

129
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,760
It's like I had in my last design.

130
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,210
All right.

131
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:45,040
So if I do that and refresh that page there you go a nice full with blog post.

132
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,090
hand side and buttons.

133
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,350
If I have them great.

134
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:55,840
All right.

135
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,140
Let's go over and go to appearance menus.

136
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,750
I can see that that Hederman you.

137
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,260
Is that upper menu at the top.

138
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,960
And then there is the secondary menu which in this theme is called the footer menu.

139
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,920
People can get to them.

140
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,490
We don't want it to go too wide.

141
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,860
What I have here I might use a dropdown.

142
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,430
I think that's a good idea.

143
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,890
I could get rid of say this item on the right hand side and replace it with a dropdown item.

144
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,480
page there are all these items.

145
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:54,200
I just want to go in here and create a custom link and I think what I'll do is go to the see it's good.

146
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,690
Copy link location I've right clicked on all books and I use that link as the custom link at the top

147
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,400
But now I also want oh I don't have a title for it.

148
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:16,910
Area

149
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,670
call it all books.

150
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,410
I was missing from the footer menu.

151
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,440
And when I place him here I pull them to the right until there are some items of the one that I want.

152
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:45,220
There are also a couple of book tags that were on that footer menu.

153
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,820
Keep them on the same level and they'll be all part of the single drop down there.

154
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,130
I could even put a specific book if I wanted to as a menu and that one if I wanted to highlight a book

155
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,060
that look to the menu

156
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,770
and place it over there.

157
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,410
All books.

158
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,750
And there's my drop down.

159
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,930
Nice.

160
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,490
In this lesson you completely change the look and feel of the website but kept all the content intact.

161
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,070
This is a good example of both how separating the custom post-date content into a plugin preserved the

162
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,370
This illustrates the power of Wordpress as a CIMS or content management system that wraps up this chapter

163
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,480
in the next.

164
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,740
for your Wordpress Web site Business.

165
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,540
We'll be working with live web sites either with a free trial account or one that you've purchased because

166
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,050
Let's go
