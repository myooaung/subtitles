00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.200
In this video you'll learn how newcomers can manage free products and promotional downloads.

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.580
When building an e-commerce web store it's a good idea from a marketing perspective to get your potential

3
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.770
email list.

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.210
Newcomers can take care of the set up for you.

5
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.390
for free items like billing and shipping information.

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.200
Let's start by just taking a look at what we're trying to do here.

7
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.450
First have your Wordpress dashboard open and have your woo comer's store website open in another tab.

8
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.510
Follow along as we take a look at the web store.

9
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090
I'm going to go to the second page like we had done before.

10
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.980
Now the idea here is that if somebody is checking out the free product and they want to download that

11
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020
for those users.

12
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.490
So if that person wants to get the free download first of all the default is if they hit the add to

13
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.280
Now they could go directly to the checkout page and that's fine but if they go to the checkout page

14
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.040
then they have a couple of extraneous items here.

15
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.240
Why would you need to enter a coupon if your item is free in the first place.

16
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.600
And secondly in your billing details if I just want to collect a name and an email address why do I

17
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.660
don't need to ask people for additional information call the order notes at all for just giving them

18
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.080
a free product or having them do is give us their email address and their name and then we want to streamline

19
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.780
Now in this lesson this will be a great example of having a need for a client web site and going out

20
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.470
and finding the answer from what someone else has already done.

21
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.030
So I did some research because this was a project that a client needed done for their commerce store.

22
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.620
So I went and looked around and this great article at web training wheels Dotcom has a couple of compiled

23
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.980
tutorials information that makes a great little system for commerce.

24
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.050
First of all you streamline the checkout process to eliminate these billing details by using a little

25
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.630
down the checkout process by doing that.

26
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.040
You also send the people directly to the checkout page instead of having them go to the cart first and

27
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.200
about in the last chapter.

28
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.300
Now you can go to this Web address and find this tutorial if you like but I do have the code snippets

29
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.320
available in your resources section.

30
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.620
I did want to direct you to read a couple of things if you want to look at this a little bit deeper

31
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.320
in this web training wheels Dockum tutorial.

32
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.280
First of all there there's a couple of interesting reasons that she links to about reasons you might

33
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.840
And we're not going to go into that right now but it's interesting reading.

34
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.870
So if you just said a product to zero dollars as we said you've got the checkout process with all that

35
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.870
Skai verge and I opened up the skivers link which was a tutorial about how to simplify a free commerce

36
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.700
checkout.

37
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.490
And that code is something that she's just duplicated right here and it works great in my client's project.

38
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.510
But secondly she got another piece of code right down here a little smaller piece from this person here.

39
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.600
And I've used this successfully as well to send users directly to the checkout page after they add it

40
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.860
Now back in the Wordpress dashboard if we look under appearance and themes.

41
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.570
Let's take a look at how we're treating these themes.

42
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.340
I hope that the thought had occurred to you when looking back here in these pieces of code I mentioned

43
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.030
that they go in the functions does ph profile.

44
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.050
If you're just putting them right into your theme or your child theme but I hope that you had thought

45
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.580
well we're not really using a child theme here.

46
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.660
We could make a child theme of the storefront theme and then that's where we would want to put our code

47
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.580
in the duplicate functions that ph file inside of our child theme Instead let's use the code snippets

48
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.810
plug in a few chapters back.

49
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.890
I recommended that you check out the code snippets plug in and let's install it right now on our site.

50
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.120
So go to plug ins add new and this way we won't have to add that snippet of code to the functions dot

51
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.490
We can use a place inside of a plugin to do the same thing.

52
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.370
So make a search inside of the ADD plug and screen for code snippets.

53
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.980
It's this one right here.

54
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.960
This is a great plug in so I'm clicking install now and then when it installs the plug in and gives

55
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.030
Go ahead and follow along and do the same on your site.

56
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.630
Now you should have a snippet plug in settings panel over on the left hand side with the little pair

57
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.940
And if we go over to the right and click add new it will open us a editing page where we can create

58
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.770
a new snippet.

59
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.330
So I'm just going to type free product as the title of this snippet.

60
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.830
Then at the bottom under settings we can run the snippet everywhere.

61
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.230
We can only run it in the administration area or only run it on the site front end and that's fine to

62
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.020
So for now I'm just going to save this code snippet so that I make sure I have that saved and I can

63
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.690
So now in this tutorial here at web training wheels dot com.

64
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:54.070
She says that you can copy and paste the following code into your child themes functions ph file which

65
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.930
would be the best way to do it if you were using a child theme.

66
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.580
She also recommends a plug in which I was thinking that you read the reviews this plugin doesn't have

67
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:15.220
So instead of being dependent on a third party developer and another plug in my system if this code

68
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.630
So go up here inside this code block.

69
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.780
And I'm going to go over to the copy icon it's selected for me and it tells me your press control see.

70
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.500
And so I've got the whole entire block of code on my clipboard here.

71
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.590
there at the top and hit Control V and copy my snippet right in there.

72
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:55.940
Now just to make sure that everything looks good I'm going to save this without activating this snippet

73
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.810
at this time.

74
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:05.160
Now you might remember that if you leave out a semi-colon in some of this code you might get the white

75
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.280
So before I activate this code snippet I want to make sure that in case something's wrong with it and

76
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.210
area.

77
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.780
of a C panel.

78
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:36.000
But in this case code snippets plug in gives you a way to deactivate all your snippets so you can manage

79
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.000
So the way I found out about that is I went to the plug in page itself I go into WordPress darg clicking

80
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:55.900
Here's the code snippets plug in and click the title to open it up and in the FAA que section there

81
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.860
is a question here.

82
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.840
Hey I just activated a snippet and my whole site broke.

83
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.910
So there's two ways that you can turn on what they call safe mode.

84
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.020
So all the snippets will be deactivated.

85
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:21.360
to open up your W.P. dash config file and put this line in there and then upload that file back into

86
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.830
There is a second way and this might be a little bit easier.

87
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:33.750
You can just place this piece of code after the you are l so it's questionmark snippets.

88
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:42.190
If you append that to the R L that should turn off all snippets and allow you to access that page.

89
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.090
So you can always find that at Wordpress dot org.

90
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.970
Under the code snippets plug in area.

91
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.540
So we'll go back into edit snippet.

92
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:57.760
And I'm just going to go down to the bottom here and click save changes and activate do this on your

93
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:08.050
However I did check the box to only run this on the front end so cross your fingers if we go back in

94
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.710
So that's great.

95
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.070
I already have one item inside of my shopping cart where I was testing before so I just hit the red

96
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.320
See what that code did to change the way the customer interacts with the store here.

97
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.150
I think I'm going to add this to the cart free product great.

98
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.560
So right there it added it to the car.

99
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:51.760
But like I mentioned before I do now have to go to the shopping cart to be able to check out and go

100
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.220
get this product.

101
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.420
But I've got my shopping cart here now which is that extra step we want to remove later.

102
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.210
And if I hit proceed to check out this is what I want to see.

103
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.400
I just have my first name last name and e-mail address.

104
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.300
There's no coupon code right here and no comment field down here.

105
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:16.520
And it just says place the order and then I'll be able to get my free download right away with no hassle.

106
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.110
Let's add the second part of the code though.

107
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.830
If we go down a little bit lower in the tutorial you can see that here's this other block of code.

108
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:31.060
And this one directs the person right to the checkout page instead of having them look at the shopping

109
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:39.310
Another step eliminated in their process so click the click the button right here and hit Control C

110
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:50.950
Since this is all doing the same thing I'm just going to put a couple of carriage returns after the

111
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.230
Make sure that ends in a semi-colon.

112
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:07.890
I've got everything now if you read that tutorial carefully you'd see that just above this redirect

113
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.200
We need to put the proper product ID right here in the code.

114
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:24.090
And so if we go up to our shop we know that we need to find that the right product right here and it's

115
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:25.900
It's.

116
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:33.080
And so we need to go back into our commerce products list and find the ID associated with that.

117
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.440
So you know I find it easy to go under products and when I'm looking for something but I know I'm going

118
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.460
I'll just right click and open a new tab with that information.

119
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:51.340
So now go to that tab which is my products page in one single two shows as soon as you roll over it.

120
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.710
You'll see the I.D. And it's also in the RL.

121
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.370
When you click on it just like post or page IDs in wordpress.

122
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.060
So over here in the tutorial you can see that we want to only send them directly to the checkout page

123
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:16.140
if they're trying to buy that product I.D. 99 because it's the free download product.

124
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:31.050
So I'll go back to that snippets page and instead of 35 I'll put 99.

125
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.590
Now go to the bottom and save my changes.

126
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.880
Now this is an active code snippet.

127
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.750
So I want to make sure that nothing went wrong right there with this code snippet active.

128
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.600
So if I go back to the Web site and see what happens if I hit the home button to go back to the shop

129
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.980
looks good everything I think is working.

130
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.260
I do have zero items in my shopping cart right now.

131
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:06.380
So if I find a free item a single number to add to the cart.

132
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.830
And here is where there's another suggestion in that tutorial.

133
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:16.220
This was an AJAX call that allowed this to open up within the window and show me that view cart button.

134
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.810
Now I don't want that to happen with this free product.

135
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.710
So let's first test that if I remove that from the shopping cart.

136
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.550
that should send me directly to the checkout.

137
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.610
Excellent.

138
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:46.560
And you know I can place my order with just first last name and an e-mail but that last change we need

139
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:59.020
We need to disable a certain option in the commerce settings and that is to enable Ajax add the cart

140
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.080
buttons on the archives.

141
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.630
If we do this that will just streamline the process for free products all that much more.

142
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.840
So if people click Add to Cart when they're in a list of products like here on the homepage then they'll

143
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:28.210
So if I go back to one of my wordpress dashboard pages I can go under wew commerce and settings.

144
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:35.740
I'm looking for a settings under products and display is the sub item that we're looking for is this

145
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:44.890
If we disable that Ajax add to cart buttons on the archives and then hit save changes that will let

146
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:54.640
Even if we're in an archive page like this one that shows all of our items at once.

147
00:15:54.690 --> 00:16:01.660
First I'll remove this from my shopping cart and let's just go back to the home page here to refresh

148
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.440
New settings.

149
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.230
I'll go to that free product on the second page.

150
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.050
And now even though it's a list of products I should be able to click Add to Cart and it should take

151
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.110
Great.

152
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:30.350
having to fill in all their shipping and or billing information inside of the web store.

153
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.630
In this lesson you customized your woo commers store using a couple code snippets from an online tutorial

154
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.490
by cutting down on the number of steps in the checkout process.

155
