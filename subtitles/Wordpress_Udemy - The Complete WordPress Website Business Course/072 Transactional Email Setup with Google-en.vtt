00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.130
In this video we'll be exploring lots of options for setting up secure and reliable email systems that

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.230
You'll be setting up several free but robust ways of using best practices for transactional email from

3
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.270
You'll be able to take control of outgoing email and separate it from your web hosting account.

4
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.810
By the end of this video you'll have the powerful email sending capabilities needed for e-commerce sites

5
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.050
membership's systems and even internal marketing email making WordPress into the interactive content

6
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.660
Let's start by making sure you have a live server set up hopefully with a domain name pointed to it

7
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.030
and resolving back to that domain similar to what I have at.

8
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.040
Greg Davis duck.

9
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.460
If you open the students W.P. of course dot com Web site itself you'll remember that we have a resources

10
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.030
There's also a link right at the bottom of the page that if you open the resource page under hosting

11
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.670
we've got a few different hosting programs available.

12
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.240
And firstly I'd recommend checking out site ground because the least expensive plan of shared hosting

13
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.230
If you click the link will open up in a new window and you can go ahead and look at the startup price.

14
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.930
Now the regular price is nine ninety five a month.

15
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.100
But however many months you commit to it's only 395 a month and it even comes with a free domain name

16
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.130
and so in order to get started you just sign up by clicking this orange button and then you can buy

17
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.330
managing my domains and here's my Greg Davis dot com domain right here.

18
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.590
The way that I point my most of my domains to site Ground is by using name servers and you put in this

19
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.490
information here two different name servers that my site Ground account has given to me back inside

20
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.250
Dot com.

21
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:26.110
The ICO web hosting link points to rob Percival's own eco web hosting Dakoda UK and your course comes

22
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.210
program as I have taught in a previous video you can have a live host available for a trial period at

23
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.190
Eco web hosting back at students that W.P. of course dot com flywheel is one of my favorite web hosts

24
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.700
and if you sign up using this link the flywheel 60 day free demo site is free instead of a 14 day demo.

25
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:06.040
You get a 60 day demo at flywheel for being a student at you to me for the WP dev course dot com course.

26
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.730
Finally another free trial which does last for 14 days is at cloud ways which gives you a really fast

27
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.170
instance at the Digital Ocean.

28
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.060
If you sign up for it that way and if you just start by clicking get started and sign up for it.

29
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.120
It will allow you to go through the sign up process and choose which free trial you'd like to use.

30
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.930
If you go with Digital Ocean it will give you 14 days to play with a free website and you can point

31
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.520
Whichever way you've gone about getting a live hosting program together and wordpress installed go ahead

32
00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.480
I've got Greg Davis dot com open and we'll go through how to set up S-M T.P. or transactional email

33
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.010
for outgoing email called as MTV email through Google dotcom first of all let's take a look at the plug

34
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.010
as A.P. Mailer.

35
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.640
And if you click on it you can see the header image.

36
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.690
And so it'll look familiar to you.

37
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.630
And even though it says that it's not quite compatible up to the Wordpress version I'm using.

38
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.140
It does work and I've tested it and it's got more than 90000 installs lots of five star ratings and

39
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.770
That second post man plug in that you see they're called G-mail API extension is just his older plug

40
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.120
So use the newer postman S.M. T-P mailer plug in.

41
00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.770
And what I'd like to do is maybe I'll just go back to the log out button and I'm going to use the last

42
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.150
your password button here on the log in page to send myself an e-mail.

43
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:19.160
I'm going to use my username and click get new password and this causes WordPress to send me an email

44
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.500
and then if I don't click the confirmation link I won't have to reset my password.

45
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.920
So I've opened up my email client or my email program called Mozilla Thunderbird and I got this email

46
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.000
and it is my password reset email and I'm not going to click this link and reset my password.

47
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.220
But what I will do and I'll have you do in whatever email program you use is to somehow look at the

48
00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:01.410
So if I click more and then view source for this e-mail I can see that there is a lot of information

49
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.600
up here that is in there before it goes to the actual content of the e-mail.

50
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.310
Here at the bottom of this e-mail header can reveal a lot about where your e-mail is going and coming

51
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.690
And you can see that as I go down here it's got the e-mail address and I can I can make sense of some

52
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.520
Really there is I know that this S-G is like around my SGV dot net.

53
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.190
This is actually my server itself and I can see that it's the authentication results.

54
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.590
The SPF is neutral.

55
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:46.740
If I had an a Sender Policy Framework set up inside of the domain it might say pass for giving permission.

56
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.200
And that would be better than just having it neutral it's neutral.

57
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:58.200
Let's say it's neither this this IP address which is where my e-mail was sent from is neither permitted

58
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:05.430
nor denied by this domain which is my part of my name server and the server that I own at site Ground

59
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.670
And this is my IP address.

60
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:17.490
So if somebody were to hack into my web site itself or or into my email and start to spoof this IP address

61
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.210
it wouldn't be blocked or anything like that because it's not permitted nor denied for any domain name

62
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.220
and I could get my IP address or my server name here banned from sending email.

63
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:39.360
And so I can see that that's just coming directly from from site ground and I don't actually have a

64
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.670
S-M T.P. server set up.

65
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:57.660
Now a best practice is to set up so that you're using an s team PC as a.p server and that it is identified

66
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:07.500
and authenticated using some method the initial method is SPF and depends on what type of S-M T.P. server

67
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:15.750
But anything is better than just the default settings here especially on shared servers where somebody

68
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.450
their IP address or not.

69
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:39.000
and log in to my Greg Davis dot com WordPress dashboard once again and look at my installed plug ins.

70
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.570
And this is what I'll have you do.

71
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.730
Go ahead and open up your Wordpress dashboard add the postman plug in.

72
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.070
in I click activate and follow along and do the same thing.

73
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.850
Now it says postman is not configured and it's mimicking out-of-the-box WordPress email delivery.

74
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:09.120
I'm sure that right now if I did an e-mail either from the contact form or from the forgotten password

75
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.190
WordPress.

76
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:31.140
Gmail as your S-M T.P. server especially for clients that use Gmail already they would have to have

77
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.260
SATB server for free as long as you have a Google account and a Gmail.

78
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:49.460
And so what I'll do is go under settings and go into the post man as anti-peace settings.

79
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:56.550
Another thing that you'll find useful is if you go under WordPress dot org and under plug ins search

80
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.900
And if you go down here you can read a little bit about it but if you go to FNQ that's the frequently

81
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:17.070
There is a great little set of instructions and a video about setting up the Google SSTV server in post

82
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:24.060
man and I followed these with great success to set up Google as my SMTP server and I'll have you do

83
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:32.400
If you don't already go to Google dot com and get yourself a G-mail e-mail address it's easy and free

84
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.200
to do this kind of set up for yourself.

85
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:53.160
This is an easy way to set up configuration using postman S-M T.P. and the email for me in Google is

86
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.790
So I'll just put that e-mail address in there and again follow along with your own Gmail account pause

87
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:14.800
Now at gmail the man plug it knows that it's S-M T.P. dot gmail dot com.

88
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:24.420
So since that's correct I'll just click next and now it is checking to see what the G-mail provider

89
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.890
This has some dependencies on whether your host is strong enough to use it.

90
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.460
of the best is to use Gmail on port 587.

91
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:52.690
So let's go ahead and do that with the off 2.0 selected and I'll just hit next and now here's where

92
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.090
And that's where I got that information from WordPress dot org right here and I used the this link to

93
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.870
So go ahead and do that.

94
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.430
Now I'm going to need to put in a Client ID and a client secret so that I don't have to store my e-mail

95
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.370
transactional emails.

96
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:35.950
And so by going back to here and opening the Google developers con. I've got a tab open in my browser

97
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.710
logged in with my profile which is that same email address.

98
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.940
The gmail address that I have at Google that I had set up inside of post man.

99
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.600
And so with this open I followed those instructions and if I click credentials right here you can see

100
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.900
that I've set up I've set up a client ID.

101
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:13.690
And I just named it post man as a.p so that I would know what it's called and I could refer to it later.

102
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.530
And so I have a client id and a client secret here.

103
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:24.220
So if I just hit Control C and I hope you're following along and doing the same thing by pausing the

104
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.710
secret Control-C to copy and back at my web site control the.

105
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.150
And now if I just hit next it says I'm done.

106
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:48.970
When I hit finish it'll save the settings and then I grant permission with the email provider for postman

107
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.780
So I'll finish right here I don't need my browser.

108
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.860
OK so now I have a little red line over here and I've configured it but I have not received permission

109
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:09.070
So if I just click the grant permission as long as I'm logged in with my gmail account it asks me if

110
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.130
And so even if you're using a temporary domain at your live server this will still work using a temporary

111
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:32.670
And so I'll just click allow right now and it navigates right back and it says the 2.00 the off 2.00

112
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.630
And it says postman is configured.

113
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:44.560
Now you can use the send a test mail link or we can do that same thing you know all I'm going to do

114
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.580
my username and click get new password.

115
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.790
This will generate that email again and this time when that e-mail goes to my email client my email

116
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:16.130
So I've gone into my email program again and I opened the email that was sent from WordPress this time.

117
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.760
You can see that the From address is actually different the from address is my gmail account.

118
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.580
So I know that that post man S.M. T.P. setting that I made just now is working.

119
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:34.530
And let's take a look at the view sourceless take a look at the source code above the e-mail content.

120
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:40.820
First of all the first thing I notice is that there is a DKIM signature there's some signature and authentication

121
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:51.050
And you can see that if I look at the authentication results I'm getting some different places that

122
00:15:52.670 --> 00:16:01.310
I can see there's a different IP address the SPF results are pass instead of that neutral that I had

123
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:07.910
Now the From address is my gmail address and so potentially you or your client might want to set up

124
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:14.100
a special gmail address for your business rather than using a client's personal Gmail address.

125
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:21.860
If they do have one so you can see that you know it's been the same Tepes been from Google dot com.

126
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.320
There's a DKIM authentication which is another secondary authentication.

127
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.970
So that is a really good email setup.

128
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:45.250
If I look also over here you know the authentication results and it's received from a different IP address

129
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.110
This is actually an IP address at Google dot com.

130
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:56.200
And because we trust Google to map to manage their email sending We're using their SMPTE server because

131
00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.050
Oh great.

132
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.340
And that's fine to have that inside of my e-mail header.

133
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.210
click that password reset.

134
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.100
I don't have to change my password.

135
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.620
I'm just testing the e-mail headers.

136
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.450
Congratulations.

137
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:36.150
In this lesson you use the word Bresse Web site at your live server to set up transactional e-mail sending

138
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.180
through an external EQ as a.p server.

139
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:45.330
You set it up using a Google account and a gmail address so that your WordPress website can send email

140
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:54.420
We use another even more powerful e-mail server to send transactional email through our WordPress system

141
00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.270
while Google lets you send up to ninety nine emails per day with their free servers send grids free

142
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:06.340
Limits are much higher allowing 1000 emails a day for the first week and going up from there.

143
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.390
They allow 12000 emails a month with their free level
