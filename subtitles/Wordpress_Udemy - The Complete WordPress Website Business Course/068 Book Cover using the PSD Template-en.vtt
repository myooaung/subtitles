00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.710
In this video we'll get back into a little graphic design by editing the book cover PTSD or Photoshop

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.000
image provided by Studio press with the author pro theme as a Photoshop document.

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730
other image editing software.

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.230
The bookbinding layer is a transparent overlay which allows you to replace the cover image and still

5
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.070
the cover image and title and exported a web ready image for your author pro web site using either Photoshop

6
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.180
or a free image editing program.

7
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.400
You've probably noticed that these book images have this kind of binding fold over look on the left

8
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.680
Now these weren't created individually.

9
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.220
It was an overlay using a Photoshop document that makes these different cover images appear as if they're

10
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.550
Let's take a look at one of the images in the Wordpress dashboard inside of the media library.

11
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.350
Scroll down to where we have some of these book images.

12
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.860
Click on this one.

13
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.180
It's looking like it's 720 pixels by 11 40 and we know that there's a specific proportional size that

14
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.560
these need to be so that the cover doesn't get cut off with any cropping.

15
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.110
And there's also a let's see if we go and look under appearance widgets.

16
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.110
We've gone through in this chapter and used the author pro feature book widget set up front page too.

17
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.960
But if we look at one of these widgets we can see that the author pro image thumbnail that created is

18
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.890
Now your theme demo content as you remember was downloaded from your theme.

19
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.460
desktop.

20
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.740
I got a demo content files folder that I unzipped from the zip file and as a folder now called graphics

21
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.710
and assets and then there's a book cover PTSD or dat PTSD image file.

22
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.460
Now if I open this up you can see that it's four point six nine megabytes and we're just going to go

23
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.830
Photoshop and I told it to keep the layers.

24
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.350
It's telling me that some of the text layers have missing fonts and that's ok it's just because the

25
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.730
You can go ahead and just if you double click on the font or error icon here it'll say that substitution

26
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.110
And so if I'd want to edit this layer as well it's going to substitute a font for me and I can change

27
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.510
and use any of the fonts that I have installed on my computer from Photoshop.

28
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.420
So now if I have an author name and a book title name there is an image behind.

29
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.590
And I also have this cover which you could see as kind of a layer that has an effect on it called a

30
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.820
Now if I get rid of that gradient overlay you can see that it removed the kind of highlighting that

31
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.940
So I just click that to make it appear back again and that's what we're working with.

32
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.880
It's 720 by 11:40 just like we saw inside of our media library.

33
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.980
And if I go back inside of my widget area here and I look at what the thumbnail size is going to be

34
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.640
570 by three 60.

35
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.530
So if I make that with 360 you can see that the height would be 570.

36
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.110
So the thumbnail size has been created because it's proportional with the size of the original graphic

37
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.370
Now this is inside Photoshop and I mentioned that that image was almost 5 megabytes.

38
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.940
If you have Photoshop you can open up the file of any size.

39
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.430
If you remember Pichler we had the Pichler editor and we use that for compressing and adjusting images

40
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.510
for the web.

41
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.890
One problem with the pixel or browser based editor is that you can't open up the file that's bigger

42
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.560
like when you open up photo P dot com and it's able to open any size.

43
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.020
So I might just take.

44
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.680
Hit file and click open.

45
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.440
Inside of photo P.

46
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:11.200
Now go into my demo content files folder graphics and assets and if I open that book cover what we want

47
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.740
an image the layers are available to us.

48
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.830
We can see this gradient overlay and what we want is to place a new cover image which is this layer

49
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.200
And that way no matter what image we have on our book cover it's going to show a nice imitation of a

50
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.560
bookbinding here on the left hand side.

51
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.810
Now whether you use photo P or you have Photoshop.

52
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.570
with.

53
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:59.010
So I'm going to be using Photoshop but in either case you can use either program to work with your P.S.

54
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.420
First of all I'll open another image within Photoshop.

55
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.370
That's going to come from my graphics and assets folder within the demo content files folder again.

56
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.180
This one is a large image that we've used before and we used it in our brochure site originally at the

57
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:31.050
So now if I take this image and I want to put it into this Photoshop document first thing I have to

58
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.340
add it to this other image up here which I have in another tab.

59
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.110
Now double click this little lock symbol and then I can hit OK.

60
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.770
That just unlocks this layer so that if I have my indicator tool here I can move this layer and drag

61
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:06.260
What that does is it makes another layer basically move that layer from this image and it copied it

62
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.520
So now I can move this around.

63
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.690
If you did pull it in and it was below the cover image you wouldn't see it because this layer is underneath

64
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.160
the cover image layer.

65
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.610
That might just open my history panel and just go back to where I was that layers in a good place for

66
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.980
quite tall enough

67
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.240
I'm going to move it down until it's even with the bottom and then I have something going on up here

68
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.690
The image isn't quite large enough so I have a white color a little stripe at the top.

69
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.520
I don't want to just trim that because I need to preserve the size and proportions of my book title

70
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.510
I also think that the image is a little bit dark to have the title coming out and looking good.

71
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:20.130
I'm going to make an additional layer I have layer 1 selected and I'll click this little add layer button.

72
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.070
So here on Layer 2 I'm going to use a little bit of a gradient.

73
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:33.890
So if I use the marquee tool I'm going to select a certain area of my image right here.

74
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:44.630
So from about here up what I want to do is have this image gradually fade up into just a clear area

75
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.190
So over here where under the fill tool if you hold down and drag across there is something called the

76
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.530
And now it's going to use the colors or different patterns that you have here.

77
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.970
First of all and I want to choose my pattern.

78
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:12.670
I want it actually to go from the from the foreground color to a clear or transparent background here.

79
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:19.940
And so what I really want is to switch these tips so that I have white and I want to change this to

80
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.000
from white to transparent.

81
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:34.780
And now once I have that selected I can drag a line from here all the way down if I hold shift it will

82
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:46.720
Now what it did was it faded out my image until it got to white which is the color the background up

83
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.020
I think that looks good.

84
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:56.230
So click once to get rid of my square there and now what I'm going to do is move my book title up just

85
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:04.650
I just move this up again a hold shift that stays aligned to the right hand side.

86
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.110
Great book title and then author name down here.

87
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.350
I'd like this to be just a solid black.

88
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.800
So it shows up really well against whatever image I have down there.

89
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:26.610
I need to change the color of the lettering or change the color of the background down here.

90
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.200
If that didn't contrast well and you couldn't read the author name.

91
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:38.410
So now that I have this book image ready to go I remember I have a layer that has this gradient so that

92
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.210
out the image so that the title can come out looking good.

93
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.410
save for web and devices as we're used to doing.

94
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.710
And this I'll probably use a j peg because this is a photograph.

95
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:07.510
I want it to be coming out nice and clear and with medium quality looks really good.

96
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.690
See that's 85 K in file size 166 isn't bad either.

97
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.720
So that makes it look even better.

98
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.100
Took away some of the little graphical errors around the author name that looks really good.

99
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.300
So hit save.

100
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.330
Choose a place to save it.

101
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.270
I'm going to go to my desktop again.

102
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.270
And I've created another folder there called Author pro for the site that I'm working on now and I'm

103
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.420
And that's a nice small size.

104
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.620
when I upload it into the media library it's going to make that correct.

105
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.190
It's going to be proportional from this book size that I got from here.

106
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:14.930
So if I just bring Let's see use midnight on earth I'll just change the featured image I'll just remove

107
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.210
the desktop inside.

108
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.290
And there it is.

109
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:36.200
Open this file comes in very quickly it's only 166 K and I'll set the featured image by holding the

110
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.910
There it is.

111
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.230
There we go.

112
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:49.910
OK now if I open up my site and I hit midnight on Earth of course this isn't refresh refresh the page

113
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.950
on the home page.

114
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.040
Here is my new book cover and it has the nice overlay here.

115
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:04.650
And if I hit the individual book page I can see a larger version that looks great something seeing one

116
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:18.120
it so that it fades right back into a perfectly white color which basically disappears into the background

117
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.600
of the Web site here.

118
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:26.010
So I think I want to make this background color just us very very light gray so that it shows a border

119
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.870
I'll just make that quick change within Photoshop.

120
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.190
beneath the actual image.

121
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.300
But on top of the cover image gradient and you layer that's going to be maybe red on top of here.

122
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.700
Let's see choose there and then choose a new layer layer 3.

123
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.420
I'm going to choose a color that's going to be just a very light

124
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.160
that's fine.

125
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.050
And I'm going to fill that so I'm going to hold down and change to the pink book at two and then I'll

126
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:16.680
you know if I want to phone to see what's going on I'll just make that image later disappear for a quick

127
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:22.470
There we go.

128
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.850
So if I make that appear it doesn't look super great does it.

129
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.340
So let's go back up here and layer two is where my other gradient was and I'm just going to put it right

130
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.700
Now place this

131
00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:03.870
once they go right against my ruler doesn't it just move that little guideline up just a little bit.

132
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:10.450
You know you go stick it red about here and fade it from clear.

133
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:16.070
So I want to go back to the gradient tool I'm using again and I'm going to drop it back down from here

134
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:26.520
under that end and there we go that's going to look much better to fade into a nice beige color for

135
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.630
Very very well.

136
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:39.210
So layer two is there one thing you can do is just label your layers so that you can you know what they

137
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:58.960
This one is just background color go now hit control S and that saves document as a Photoshop document.

138
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.180
But I want to receive it with a different background color 163 cake rate.

139
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:13.020
Save this and I'm going to carve the same name and overwrite book Cover 2 and hit replace.

140
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:21.220
Right now I have to go back into Wordpress and I want to go you know what I'll do is go into the media

141
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:31.410
Now before I'm just going to delete this image permanently because it's the same file name so now when

142
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:35.790
There it is.

143
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.550
book and

144
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.580
since I deleted the image before it no longer has a featured image I'll have to set that featured image

145
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.020
choose the one I just uploaded.

146
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.710
You can already see that it's got a little bit of color so you can see the top edge of the book against

147
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.050
a white background.

148
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:14.730
So if I hit update and let's go back to the home page and we can see here it looks much better you can

149
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.240
That looks great.

150
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:28.010
In this lesson you opened the book cover dot BSD Photoshop as the file and worked with the layers so

151
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:37.250
Preserving the overlay of the left side bookbinding layer in each image and I showed you a couple of

152
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.490
In the next video we'll wrap up this chapter by changing the Web site to a completely different theme.

153
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.930
Preserving all the data from the author pro plug in and revealing how it can be displayed in any Genesys
