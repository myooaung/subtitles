00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.000
In this video I'll show you how to set up transactional email with Sparke post but only after you've

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.720
also have a dedicated WordPress plug in and they have a free level that allows for sending up to 100000

3
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.860
It's a great choice for your client sites and your own.

4
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.790
you'll be a master OK.

5
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.830
The only thing you need to know is the RL is spark Post dot com and that they do have a free WordPress

6
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.190
Ready go.

7
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.630
OK I hope that went well for you.

8
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.170
Only difference here is instead of us try for free.

9
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.480
I'm going to be hitting the logon button because I already have a spark post membership.

10
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.720
Also I'm going to go back to the plugins page of my dashboard.

11
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.690
Gray Davis dot com and I'm just going to simply deactivate the send grid plug in.

12
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.070
Now with both of my other MT P or Sendmail plugins d activated.

13
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.710
I'm free to go and find the spark post plug in and get logged into my site.

14
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.710
Spark posts and go ahead and set it up.

15
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.410
So let's the spark posts in the search bar brings it up right there.

16
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:39.080
4000 active installs right from the install plug in success page or click activate plug in

17
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.020
or right great if I scroll down and look at it Spart post.

18
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
Yes there is a spark post settings link right there.

19
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.710
Anyway And so now that I have this set up I see I'll go into can see that I used my email address Sparke

20
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.850
post at Greg Davis dot com.

21
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.150
That's actually an email alias but I used it to sign up for Sparke post right.

22
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.060
I've got a hundred thousand emails included in ten thousand email daily limit.

23
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.180
Wow that's a lot around.

24
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.210
Let's go back to that spark post plug in.

25
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.330
The API is the default or I could use as a.p with two different ports.

26
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.750
Let's try using the API.

27
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.640
So I need an API key from SPARC first.

28
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.020
So OK back to spark post you're going to go under my account.

29
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.000
And then I have AP guys here send email to me.

30
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.730
This is my Greg Davis duck API key.

31
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.400
Just give it all permissions

32
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.480
I can just let it come from any IP address and click add API.

33
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.800
OK.

34
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.320
Now this is this was true of second grade and it's true of sparkplugs.

35
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.040
it again.

36
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.710
So I'll click copy.

37
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.450
All right.

38
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.960
And then I'm actually going to go in to a document on my computer and save this API key in a text document

39
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.600
I don't know if you made a quick note of this but I've got a little notification here.

40
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.810
I'm using the sandbox domain and it's good for testing.

41
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.660
But I can only send 50 e-mails with that domain.

42
00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.300
So I've got to set up my own sending domain to send more e-mails but I'll just use this domain for testing.

43
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.470
up and tested it with my wordpress site.

44
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.090
So for now I have my API key copied on the clipboard and I'm going back to the 8 to the Wordpress dashboard

45
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.070
and I'm just going to paste the AP API key in there and I don't need to use templates at this point

46
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:35.010
or overrides could actually come I can use my own name from for a from name and I can use it as my email

47
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.980
Right now Ptomaine must match with one of your varified sending domains and when left.

48
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.180
Thank Greg Davis dot com will be used as an email domain.

49
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.570
OK.

50
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.340
I wonder if that will work for testing but if I just say save changes and see what it tells me right

51
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.870
I'm going to be using that testing spark post-box.

52
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.800
Let's if I sent a an email to testing at Greg Davis dot com.

53
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:12.220
My testing email address and sure I can show debugging messages and let's click send test email test

54
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.660
Probably because I put this email address as the from email.

55
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.410
Let's see if change is right there.

56
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.590
Let's try one more time.

57
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.900
I wonder if you ran into this problem as well because I haven't verified my Greg Davis doc sending domain.

58
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.480
It says message.

59
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.510
Invalid domain right here that pretty much tells me I'm going to need to because I am sending from an

60
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.990
actual Web site here.

61
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.410
Greg Davis dot com.

62
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.830
So let's click.

63
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.490
It's not ready to send from Greg Davis daka.

64
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.740
I have to complete at least one of the below to verify my domain ownership.

65
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.870
So SPF we're familiar with that DK.

66
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.450
I am familiar with that or email verified by email.

67
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.830
So I wonder if you went through this process.

68
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.640
If I have to I have to verify my ownership by email and they'll send me an email to either abuse that

69
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.140
Greg Davis dot com.

70
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:44.730
So in my case I can actually create an email address where I host my email as you saw in a previous

71
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.740
Pause the video right now and create that.

72
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:58.270
So as you remember I host my Greg Davis dot com email at Rackspace apps and so I've logged into Rackspace

73
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.970
to my control panel and you can see here I've created an alias called post-master and it might take

74
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:13.390
In my experience it comes very very quickly and so will click verify email right here says Email sent

75
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.100
and if I go into my mailbox OK here's my message from Sparke post.

76
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.010
Please verify your sending domain and I'll just click on this link and it will open Sparke post in another

77
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.730
Great so now they believe that I own Greg Davis dot com and so they're preventing people from abusing

78
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.490
all.

79
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:52.260
And I'll show you in a little bit later how to set up an SPF manually at your domain and a DK.

80
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.210
You can see this is a little bit more complicated than send good which had that easy system and had

81
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.510
K I am set up for me.

82
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:15.000
Ok so I'm back in the Wordpress dashboard in the spark post plug in settings page and since my settings

83
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:31.500
to be the email that the from email is and again I'll try to send to my testing email address that's

84
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.180
Great because they have verified my domain name.

85
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.430
Now open up my email program and let's check it out.

86
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.730
I'll read them in my email program and I've got that email from Spart post.

87
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.720
It says part.

88
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.610
Post email.

89
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:54.900
Regards.

90
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.460
Well let's look at the view source.

91
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.150
Look at the headers just like we did before.

92
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.900
authentication results look good Sender Policy Framework is a pass.

93
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.790
That's great.

94
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.620
And let's go over to the DKIM.

95
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.880
Now that is a fail in this case.

96
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.920
The key is not found in my DNS and that was actually expected.

97
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.360
Sparkplugs takes a little bit more manual set up to make the DKIM failed and I will expect the D-mark

98
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.020
which is good news.

99
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.880
Now I'm wondering how it went for you as a student were you able to create a special e-mail address

100
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.050
creating an SPF record and a DKIM record.

101
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.990
Well either way is possible to do.

102
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:08.500
And if you looked it up the SPF record has to be configured in the DNS records for your domain name.

103
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.350
And that depends on how your DNS is being set from your domain name.

104
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.170
For me.

105
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:22.290
I've showed you before at Greg Davis dot com I point the name servers directly at my site Ground server

106
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:29.970
and therefore I can change the DNS settings within my site Ground see panel.

107
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.040
In another case I have the DNS zone file here available to me in Go Daddy where I can set different

108
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:45.960
SPF records DKIM records in different kinds of DNS records depending on how you have it set up.

109
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.220
You may have had a different set up than me that I used in this video.

110
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.940
Just like around many topics with web site development you may have had to look up on Google or try

111
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.900
were able to do a little bit of research and find where you needed to be.

112
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.930
I need to make over here.

113
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.490
But let's look and see what Sparke post tells me to do.

114
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.770
dot com.

115
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:40.230
And this is the value that I need to put in there so that Sparke post has my domain verified via an

116
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.190
So I'll copy that which is copied to my clipboard.

117
00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:05.440
add a txt record so let's see the hostname is name in this case we know that it's Greg Davis dot com

118
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.230
is what it asked me to put right there.

119
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.200
It's a text record and the data that I want there is right here.

120
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.250
TTL means time to live.

121
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.200
And I'll just use the standard number that all of my other zone file records use.

122
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.160
Fourteen four hundred.

123
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.490
It's basically a time that it will go back and recognize changes.

124
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:40.800
All right I've added the DNS record and we can go back and refresh Sparke post right away to see if

125
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.160
across the Internet based on your DNS provider.

126
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:58.080
I'm aware that site ground I think when I'm controlling it with the C panel is very fast go daddy has

127
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:09.050
But I've had slower domain registrars in my past when I've looked at domains from client sites and such.

128
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:15.580
So let's just go back and see if I just test the SPF record.

129
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.820
Nope it looks like it needs to propagate across the internet.

130
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.780
Looks like this is a slightly different DNS record than I had before.

131
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:37.430
Possibly because I already had an refresh this page after I had verified it with the postmaster's email

132
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.370
So I just copied this here and let's go ahead and change that.

133
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.460
Looks like I've got a bunch of nice ones.

134
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.940
I do have some D.

135
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.930
DK I am records here.

136
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.280
Where's my text record.

137
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.530
Now this last one right here.

138
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:13.080
I've actually got some leftover text records in here from a Rackspace email from setting up my domain

139
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:22.380
And so for this one I'm going to they're not using that right now and not using Rackspace to send email

140
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.510
I'm going to get rid of that one.

141
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.690
And I am going to edit this text record.

142
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:41.340
So instead of having that long one I'm just going to paste the short one at record write so successfully

143
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.880
That looks much better a nice green checkbox.

144
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.410
Excellent.

145
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.940
inside of my domain inside a C panel.

146
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.520
There is one and there is one

147
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.060
know from and delete that one and delete this one.

148
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:37.640
Great now and free of DKIM records right now and I'm going to be adding a new record right here.

149
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.650
So it's a text record.

150
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:49.790
The hostname is not my domain but it is a different domain key with a special character from Sparke

151
00:15:51.140 --> 00:16:02.160
Copy that as the hostname place the name there I'll go 14 400 as normal.

152
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.110
This is going to be a text record.

153
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:17.340
You can see it's very long because it's very secure for email pay set there and click add record.

154
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.960
Great.

155
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:18.740
OK.

156
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.610
I look at it it's right down here.

157
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:20.850
Yeah.

158
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.680
That's that domain key.

159
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:28.800
Now let's see if it recognizes it I'll test that DKIM record.

160
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.540
Oh a nice green check box.

161
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:44.010
situation is a little bit different depending on where your DNS is held and how your domain is set up.

162
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.900
Now I've just done a quick test after waiting a few minutes to let the DNS propagate a little bit.

You need to be creative to solve problems in the next few videos.

171
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.980

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.380
and manage them efficiently.
