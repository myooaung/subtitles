00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.460
In this chapter we'll be looking at plug ins premium commercial ones and free plug ins from the Wordpress

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.950
This video will cover the plug in offerings at W.P. m u dev dot org.

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.910
A company in Australia that's been developing and updating WordPress plugins for a long time.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.160
By the end you'll understand some of the reasons for using commercial or premium plugins and get an

5
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.710
First let's look at the W PMU dev Web site.

6
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.400
If you just go to W.P. and you dev dot org it redirects to a secure site at age TTP.

7
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:52.190
It's called premium the PMU dev dot org and WP and you used to be the insignia for the multi-user WordPress

8
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.140
extension.

9
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.000
The way that I'm using WP dev course dot com.

10
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.350
I'm using a what is now called multi-site to enable more than one Web site in a single WordPress installation.

11
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.540
Well they started out as experts on WordPress multi-site or at the time it was called WPA and you and

12
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.400
they were a development company making plugins and extensions for Wordpress multi-site.

13
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.780
That does mean that they have a lot of plug ins and functionality that they offer for multi-site installations

14
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.070
but they have a lot of good plugins and themes as well that are part of their membership site that work

15
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.060
on all kinds of Wordpress sites.

16
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.030
I've talked about them before a little bit in our earlier chapters in this course but let's take a look

17
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.620
They have a number of different categories online business SEO Marketing publishing community multi-site

18
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.130
and Buddy press which is a social networking extension for wordpress.

19
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.980
But if we scroll down a little bit we can look at some of their best plug ins.

20
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.350
my business.

21
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.390
Many of these plug ins are available for you to play with inside of your student sandbox.

22
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:25.160
Students W.P. of course dot.com pre-installed inside of your own Web site at WBM udev dot org.

23
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.690
The plugins list if I scroll down a little bit you can see the number of plugins that they've developed.

24
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.970
And another thing that I've talked about in the past that's very important for me as I run a WordPress

25
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.690
meaning as Wordpress comes out with new versions.

26
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.130
I want these plugins to be updated so they're sure to work into the future.

27
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.040
And these are one of the plug ins that I use often is called Ultimate branding this plug in lets you

28
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.890
display your own logos colors.

29
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.780
It really lets you brand the dashboard to how ever you want it to look.

30
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.990
If that's not important to your client at all you can populate the administration dashboard with your

31
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.490
so that your clients know that that's coming from you.

32
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.480
This plugin is all about branding your Wordpress installation and handing it off to your client.

33
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.320
You can do easy customisations to the log in page.

34
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.170
You can put in your logo and different links in the admin bar and there's a lot of different parts to

35
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.010
I'm using the ultimate branding plug in to brand the dashboard areas at WP of course dot com when you

36
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.420
I've used it to create some custom links up here at the top to eliminate some of the menu items that

37
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.530
And putting a link down here to the hosting theme and plug in resources page that I have inside of your

38
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.400
dashboard.

39
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.310
Another great plug in that comes with your WPA new dev membership is called their dashboard.

40
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.740
This one manages the plug ins and themes that you're using from WBM udev within your membership.

41
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.780
It installs into your dashboard and gives you a lot of different benefits to going in and installing

42
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.270
this plug in.

43
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.960
It gives you some up time monitoring.

44
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.890
It can show you the performance and some different stats about the Web site it's installed on and it

45
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.950
inside your dashboard in addition to those general use plug ins they've also got some very specific

46
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.250
reports and gets your site hardened for security.

47
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.870
your Wordpress installation and help you to fix them pop up pro is a very configurable pop up plug in

48
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.790
not.

49
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.750
It's a great place to build an email list and a way to do that on your Web site.

50
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.800
Membership 2 pro is a plug in we're going to delve deeply in one of our future chapters where we'll

51
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.730
build a membership site from this plug in and wordpress.

52
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.960
One of the plugins that I use all the time from WBM udev is their backup and restoration put plug in

53
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:24.380
They built it as kind of a time machine like the backup system on a Mac and it kind of is it's easy

54
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.820
it to an external location or right there on the server downloaded to your own computer.

55
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.590
And it's easy to restore that version of the Web site.

56
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:48.500
It also has scheduled backups that you can incorporate so that every day or every hour or every week

57
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.750
go back and restore a backup.

58
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.400
I use this plug in all the time for web site migrations just like we've used the free all in one.

59
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:12.670
I use the snapshot pro plug in to do the same process I would encourage you to go in and explore their

60
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.730
There's appointments schedulers there's events schedulers and sign up areas.

61
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.430
There's all kinds of different functionalities that you can add to WordPress and you can trust that

62
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:39.370
all these plug ins are always going to work inside of your dashboard at W.P. dev course come inside

63
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.280
If you click plug ins you'll notice that a lot of the plug ins that I have preinstalled inside your

64
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:57.280
We've got custom press and as we go down Google Maps market press membership to that pop up pro plug

65
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.120
in this course will use these plug ins to accomplish what we need.

66
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.660
WPA you devs membership works on an ongoing basis.

67
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:20.670
You pay a monthly or yearly fee to access all of their plugins and themes on an unlimited basis.

68
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:28.710
That means you can use them on all your own sites and all your client sites as much as you want.

69
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:37.390
As I start to use these plug ins on my sites and my client sites in this video we went over some of

70
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.990
a premium plug in is often the best way to go.

71
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.800
In the next video we'll explore another resource for premium plug ins.

72
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:58.600
The enviro marketplace in Vado isn't just a single developer but a resource for thousands of developers

73
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.830
selling their plugins and themes at affordable prices.
