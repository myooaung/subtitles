00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.390
You saw in the last video how you can avoid editing a child theme.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.640
That's part of a framework like agenesis by adding CSSA to a in instead of editing the child themes

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.070
style sheet.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.780
What if you need to make edits or customizations that require adding code to the functions that HP file

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.100
but you still want to avoid altering the child theme in this video.

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.910
you add the code into a plugin instead.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.880
For this exercise since I'm not going to allow you to change the code or possibly break the multi-site

8
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.270
I'm going to have you open man up again.

9
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.380
I'm going to the one I called Live Dasch site and I'm going to log in page.

10
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.280
Go ahead and do this yourself.

11
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.220
Now that we have the dashboard open lets go to plugins add new

12
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.280
and let's just search for code snippets.

13
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.930
That's a common word for pieces of code that we might copy and paste and alter for our own purposes

14
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.540
inside of a CSSA file functions dopy H-P file or even inside of a plugin.

15
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.170
The first one that comes up in the list actually called code snippets is a good one that I've used several

16
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.970
I can see that it's got more than 20000 active installs it's been updated recently and I know that it

17
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.730
So click Install now.

18
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.740
And go ahead and activate the plug in.

19
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.050
Now that we have code snippets activated you can click manage under the plug in page itself or you can

20
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.730
Now we don't have any snippets at this time and I can dismiss the survey if I like so you can go over

21
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.300
You can look through the general settings but I'll generally leave these at the defaults.

22
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.940
You can look at because it will show you syntax highlighting inside of the code area in the editor.

23
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.630
be indented and however you prefer.

24
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.580
Now this code snippets plugin is designed to take code that is PIH Pico meant to go in functions Doppie

25
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.980
HP of a theme but not see SS or stylesheet code that you'd put somewhere else.

26
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.850
In that case we could use the simple custom CSSA plugin that we used in the last video alongside this

27
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.380
Let's try to make some edits somewhere that would require an added to the functions Doppie HP file perhaps

28
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.810
Let's change the Wordpress logo on the log in page to our own logo and make it click to the home page

29
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.940
Now I'll just start by creating a new snippet cards loggin logo and I'll go down and save it for now

30
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.070
with just its name.

31
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.480
Great now I've got to find the code necessary and some advice perhaps on changing the log in log in

32
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.620
I've gone over to Google and I search for Wordpress replace luggin page logo.

33
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.380
looks like it's exactly what I want and it's got some information about the log in form and how it works.

34
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.380
that link to the my own home page instead of to the Wordpress org home page.

35
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:18.110
So I'm looking for a code snippet that I can use customizing the log in changing the log in Logo.

36
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.400
functions that HP file of the active Feme and you can see that the advice is to upload a new image under

37
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.000
Yes in a directory named images so I know you have to do a few things here and follow along with me

38
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.340
in your own site.

39
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.240
I'm going to first select this entire block of code and hit control-C to copy it and I'm going to bring

40
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.210
Code editing window inside of my snippets plugin.

41
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.340
I'm under my log in logo's snippet and I placed that there.

42
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.230
I'm going to go ahead and call it.

43
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.880
I'm going to call it new logo new dash logo dot PMG and it's in the images file.

44
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.770
And now I can expect that if that's working.

45
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.470
I think that if I would have removed the semi-colon like we did in a previous video we could have broken

46
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.990
In that case we might have to go in just via FCP or in our local environment here and disable the plugin

47
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.080
and we'll go over a couple of steps on how to retrieve our code snippets if we happen to break the site

48
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.900
using them using this plugin.

49
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.210
For now I'm going to go with that.

50
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.180
I'm going to remember that my file name needs to be new dash logo new logo dot thing and I'm going to

51
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.530
I know there was a certain size of the logo the size of the logo should be 80 by 80 although we can

52
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.280
as a next step.

53
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.170
So if I open Photoshop and now I'm going to again make a new file this time I'm going to do it 80 by

54
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.670
There's the size of that little WordPress logo.

55
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.530
Maybe I'll give it a black background as well.

56
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:56.440
And again it's easy to make up some quick versions of logos using a font.

57
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.060
Let's see.

58
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.370
My lettering is white and use a capital F..

59
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.240
And let's make that a little bit bigger.

60
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.740
It's fire weed photography right.

61
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.520
I'll do an F W

62
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.200
nice.

63
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.040
All right.

64
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.980
So remember I have to save this as a ping first.

65
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.250
Again I'm going to I'll save it right here under.

66
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.880
Actually this is in my live site so I'm going to go to my desktop and save this image under my live

67
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.270
There we go.

68
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.930
And I will call it new logo but this is a Photoshop document.

69
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.540
Now I have to go up into file save for web and devices

70
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.050
and I can save it as a ping file

71
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.730
again.

72
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.050
I'll save it in live site.

73
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:12.950
New logo.

74
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.500
It's going to be a Dopping.

75
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.550
Great now that I've got that saved if the site were live on the internet.

76
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:27.390
I would need to use FCP to make the file transfer into the images folder of my theme's area my theme's

77
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:35.720
But I'm going to use Windows Explorer to transfer that file from the desktop under live site.

78
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.670
There it is the new logo Dopping over to the file structure of the site I'm working on.

79
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.060
It's in the map folder in NHT docs.

80
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.830
My active themes folder.

81
00:08:52.020 --> 00:09:02.910
So I am still using the affinity that weepie come dash childhood to and I'm going to create a new directory

82
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:13.590
a new folder called images as the wordpress site directed me to do and other places and a whole control

83
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.900
to copy it into that folder.

84
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:24.000
Now back at my log in Logo snippet I can verify that that's the location of the image and to test it

85
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:31.270
I'm just going to go ahead and log out and it should appear with the new logo on the logon page.

86
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.920
I know why that didn't work.

87
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.270
Let me log right back in again.

88
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:42.260
And there's kind of a failsafe if you're working with your code snippets and you're not quite finished.

89
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.530
It doesn't automatically activate the snippets that you have.

90
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:59.350
And so I just need to click activate and that should give me an activation message snippet activated.

91
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:05.870
Now I should be able to log out and check that my logo is there great.

92
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.220
It's still linking to the Wordpress dot org Web site though.

93
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.180
Let's go in here and we can see what we need to do to add the link.

94
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:21.250
I just need to add this code snippet and paste it below the previous.

95
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.140
Obviously it's not in functions that ph P but in our code snippets plug in.

96
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.230
So if I take this whole thing

97
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:40.280
and I'll just say Control-C to copy I lock back in and I'm going to go to code snippets and manage that

98
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.800
and I'll make a change to it.

99
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.050
Great.

100
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.820
Let me just hit two actors and hit Control V.

101
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:05.440
If I look at the code I can see that it's going to return the home you are so that I'll be the regular

102
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:13.450
You are ill for my website here live ASH site and also the title for when you roll over the icon or

103
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:23.750
I want that to actual actually say the name of the website.

104
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.860
Now let me go to the bottom and I'll save changes.

105
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.650
Now there's one more thing we should look at under each code snippet.

106
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:37.240
Near the bottom where we are saving our changes there's actually a description of some tags we can use

107
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.820
if we're using a lot of snippets and we want to keep them organized.

108
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.990
The scope of this snippet is either to run it everywhere only run it in the administration area or only

109
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.000
In fact the log in page is considered to be on the front end and it's kind of part of the administration

110
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.580
So I'll keep the scope to run everywhere and save changes.

111
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.160
OK let's go and log out.

112
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.320
And that way we'll look at the log in page and see what our snippet has done.

113
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.940
There's the logo looking good.

114
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.050
site title or the link title is fire weed photography.

115
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:29.230
So if I click it it will open the site nice.

116
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:36.650
Now I mentioned kind of a failsafe that the plug in offers that we should look at as a final exploration

117
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:45.380
I might just go to the plugins page at Wordpress org and look it up here to get all the information

118
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:54.420
I'll just log in although I don't really need to be logged in but I'll look up the code snippets plug

119
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.880
There it is and let's open it up.

120
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.760
And one thing that I've seen let's see I think it's under the installation

121
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.080
or is it under the FH queue.

122
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.860
It is help I just activated a snippet and my whole site broke.

123
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.630
where it brings code snippets plug it into a safe mode where you can look at the code for the snippets

124
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.900
And that's a way that you can get out of any kind of problems without having to deactivate the plug

125
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.920
the site well.

126
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.510
That about covers the code snippets plug in what if you're on Genesis.

127
00:13:51.560 --> 00:14:02.470
There's actually a Genesis W.P. clip's dot net has some free plug ins that do a similar thing to the

128
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:15.950
They hold clips including C Ss and functions that BHP edits inside of a Genesis powered Web site.

129
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:21.960
It works very similarly to code snippets but it's designed to work with Genesis powered.

130
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:29.080
In this video you went back to your local development environment to install a plug in called code snippets

131
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.530
which gives you a place to put code outside of the active theme or child theme.

132
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.900
You customize the log in page by finding a code snippet at Wordpress dot org and replace the logo with

133
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.090
You also learned about W.P. clips available at WP clip's dot net.

134
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:02.540
and how to choose free and premium plug ins from commercial developers or from the free WordPress plugin

135
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.310
