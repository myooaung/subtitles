In this video you'll get your sandbox website set up at students dot W.P. of course dot com where you'll

2
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.580
Several of the Web sites you'll build in this course are made using premium themes and plug ins that

3
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.050
We'll use the student's sandbox website at students W.P. of course dotcom to learn to build these types

4
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.650
WordPress installation at W.P. of course daka.

5
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.760
Let's get started.

6
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.690
I've set up a WordPress multi-site installation at W.P..

7
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.660
Of course dot com that allows you to get your own WordPress Web site that includes all the premium themes

8
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.720
You can configure and build web sites with the themes but you won't be able to take them with you.

9
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.210
And that's the beauty of the multi-site installation.

10
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.790
I can teach you how to use all these wonderful tools and you can choose whether you want to use them

11
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.420
I didn't start out with all these developers licenses but now that I'm licensed I can sell very sophisticated

12
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.790
On a side note near the end of this course I'll be teaching you how to set up your own multi-site installation

13
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.360
Let's go over some of the premium theme and plug in providers included in your students sandbox studio

their excellent assortment of child themes.

15
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.620
and design processes as they create child themes for it.

16
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.810
to provide the themes as a starting point for my client sites.

17
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.850
We'll be experimenting with Genesis and some of the studio press themes in your sandbox site.

18
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.980
W.P. m you dev dot org is a group of excellent dedicated WordPress plugin developers.

19
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.750
They keep their plugins updated fast loading and coded well w PMU devs paid membership is well worth

20
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.070
to use with their sites.

21
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.500
end all while seeing what you're doing and without coding your sandbox is loaded with lots of their

22
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.710
I'd like to introduce you to the soliloquy slider plugin.

23
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.700
It's available at soliloquy W.P. com for the commercial version with all its excellent add ons and there's

24
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.370
I use the developers licensed version as a trustworthy mobile responsive versatile slider plug in when

25
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.030
Will be playing with some of the plug ins.

26
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.090
Excellent functions through your Sandbach site

27
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.950
in the document.

28
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.620
Web site at WP of course.

29
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:41.400
Duck click the student's sandbox button here or in the header menu and you'll see the student resource

30
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.090
Click the center button to get your own site using your private student code.

31
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.860
In just a couple of steps you'll have your own WordPress site with tons of premium themes and plug ins

32
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.210
Just fill in a username and email address.

33
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.750
The student's sandbox code choose a password.

34
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.700
and then give me a site needs to be checked and hit next

35
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.860
next just choose a name for your actual site.

36
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.150
It will be that name dot W.P. of course Dacca and choose a site title

37
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.770
and click sign up

38
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.150
great you can go to the admin area by just clicking this button or view the site and you'll be logged

39
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.650
Here's my new WordPress site within your Sandbach site you'll see that the U R L is whatever name you

40
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.690
There are some differences up at the top left is a resources button that will take you to a Resources

41
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.020
you'll see that there's a few differences in the sidebar under settings for example there's no permalink

42
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.700
adjustment settings.

43
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.700
You can however choose the themes you want to use.

44
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:41.310
Use the customize or use the widgets editor choose menus and navigation items Hetter or whatever the

45
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:53.470
You can also create pages you can create posts and you can manage media in the standard ways.

46
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.310
One quick note in terms of media and the media library.

47
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.990
I've got a limit of 32 megabytes space allowed for each of the sites in this multi-site installation

48
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.710
and this place will tell you how much space you've used so far.

49
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.820
We'll be going over how to compress and resize imagery like I indicated in one of the earlier videos

50
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.010
as we make images and imagery for the different sites we'll be making in this course.

51
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.730
You'll see that if you click plugins there's no add new button because I've got standard group of premium

52
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.360
plugins already added to the multi-site installation and available to every site including yours.

53
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.120
going to be using and going over how to use a lot of these plug ins as we go through and build sites

54
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.260
Another resource you have within your sandbox site area.

55
00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:02.580
Our tutorial videos for Wordpress WP 101 tutorial videos are excellent and I'd like to offer these to

56
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:12.660
I have a developer license with Sean hask with with WP 101 and I offer these tutorial videos privately

57
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.420

58

WBM udev also has a plugin called video tutorials that you can click through to and you or your clients

59
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.140

In this video you've learned about the premium themes and plug ins will be using to make many of the

64
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.350
You've also set up your first WordPress installation for coursework at WP dev course dot com and looked
