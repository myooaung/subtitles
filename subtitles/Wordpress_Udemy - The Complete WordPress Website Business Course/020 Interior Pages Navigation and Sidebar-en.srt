1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,880
Let's make sure visitors to the brochure site can find what they're looking for in this video.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,080
You'll create a few interior pages and the navigation buttons in the header that leads visitors to those

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,940
Here's where you'll consider what parts of the site appear on every page giving visitors every opportunity

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,310
Let's get started.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,640
First let's brainstorm what pages we need visitors to link to from the Hederman you here.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:41,100
Maybe we need a contact us page and probably an About page and then maybe let's offer a third page which

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:53,450
So if we click back to the dashboard first thing I'm going to do is go to pages and add new Let's add

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,650
Here's a challenge for you.

9
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:05,270
Add a page called about and another called contactors and another called portfolio.

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,840
And then add those three pages to the header navigation using appearance menus.

11
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,490
I'll check in with you after you're done.

12
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,000
How'd you do.

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:36,660
just show you real quick where you can get some great text that's your standard Lorem Ipsum text at

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,000
You can just scroll down choose how many paragraphs you want.

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,300
Click generate lordship some and it'll come up with some text in Latin.

16
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,770
Just for some placeholder text and so I'm at a place that just go ahead and paste as text to make sure

17
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,620
And now I can turn that off right.

18
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,290
There's an about page with some text and I'll publish it.

19
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:24,660
And when that publishes I'll go back and click Add new and let's add a contact us page.

20
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,410
Make it pretty personal and I'm going to paste the text in there again.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,890
Publish that page

22
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,050
and then a third portfolio gallery.

23
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,990
Now I can go in and change that text later but it will be give us a good idea of what text will look

24
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,200
And of course we'll add an image gallery to the portfolio page eventually.

25
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,570
Now that I have those three pages I'll go to appearance menus and I know that I'm going to be able to

26
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:22,630
put a menu in here called Hetter menu and hit create and over on the left hand side under pages I can

27
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,590
click add to menu

28
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:43,250
I'll also click that I want this to be in the primary menu location where in this theme it's at the

29
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,480
and you can also open each one of these menu items to give yourself a few more choices.

30
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,600
Now the navigation title I don't want it to be Post Number 2 no title I want that to be home.

31
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,120
Now that's saved.

32
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,580
Let's go back to the site and refresh the page and see what it looks like.

33
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,900
Nice one that's bold the page you're on.

34
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,630
And they roll over blue which is the standard color.

35
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:33,960
And if you click any of the menu items the header stays the same and it opens that page.

36
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:41,510
You may have noticed the manage in customize or button at the top of the menus there is from any page.

37
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:52,250
You can customize and just like when we created the site logo and the say identity section in the customize

38
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:59,200
or you can also manage menus there and see your changes live on the live editor on the right side.

39
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:09,360
So if you roll over menus and open that up here I've got the menu and the same options I had as under

40
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,220
you create them.

41
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,170
It'll show you what it looks like live.

42
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,470
Let's leave about on the outside so it's very visible.

43
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,940
And you can also control that the way your theme shows drop downs as well.

44
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:46,470
What if I wanted to put the contact page and the portfolio page underneath the about menu with the dropdown.

45
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,070
You can see that it's slightly indented over here as I control it inside the Customize her.

46
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,290
And then when I roll over about that's what dropdown is look like in the 2016 theme.

47
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,190
Next let's change what the sidebars display to make it more appropriate for our brochure site.

48
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:13,230
In most themes the sidebar and footer content is controlled using widgets as with the menus you can

49
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:30,740
from the sidebar and replace it with a list of pages for navigation.

50
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,620
I hope that was easy for you.

51
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,970
Here's what it looks like when I do it this time.

52
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,310
Maybe I'll start with the customize or.

53
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,630
All right now that that's open I want to open the widgets tab and it looks like there's a content bottom

54
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,560
one in two and a sidebar area.

55
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,480
to go ahead and remove each of these widgets by opening it and clicking remove

56
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,220
Let's leave the search bar there.

57
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,320
That's appropriate for a site.

58
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,760
I'll save and publish.

59
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,520
I can see that now I've just got the sidebar filled with a search window.

60
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:29,820
Let me do the other half using appearance widgets so that you can see the difference.

61
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:37,180
Now what I've got are the widgets on the right side that I can open and close and on the left side a

62
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,800
widget area.

63
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
Is a list of pages

64
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,720
and we are actually placed that below the search bar.

65
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,960
See what options I have here.

66
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,860
Maybe I'll name this pages and I can sort them by the page title the order in which they were published

67
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,150
or the ID when I go ahead and do them by page order.

68
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:24,900
And then if I wanted to I could exclude a page from the sidebar.

69
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,230
Let's go ahead and look at the site and refresh the page and take a look.

70
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,180
Great.

71
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,050
post number 2.

72
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,460
But if it wasn't named number two how do I find out what the post ID is in order to exclude it from

73
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:58,600
Well let's open the pages and if I roll over it and look down at the bottom left of my screen I can

74
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,150
That's the post Id about pages 22.

75
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,530
Contact me is post 24.

76
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:19,890
Portfolio portfolio is post 26 so I'm going to go back into a perience widgets and I'm going to exclude

77
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,880
all right.

78
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,080
Great.

79
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,360
That looks great.

80
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,800
No matter what page I'm on.

81
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,940
Those two are going to show

82
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,260
in this video.

83
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,160
You created a menu for the header of the site and revise the content on the sidebar giving Web site

84
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:08,120
site in the next video you'll configure the contact form and place it on the Contact Me page and make

85
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,260
When someone fills it up see their
