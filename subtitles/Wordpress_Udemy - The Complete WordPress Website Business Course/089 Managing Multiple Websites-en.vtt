00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.640
In this video we'll look at a few different options for managing more than one WordPress Web site from

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.300
You can save yourself a lot of time making updates monitoring your sites and keeping up with security.

3
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
By the end of this lesson you'll be able to make an educated choice about how and when to take advantage

4
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.740
When you do you'll be monitoring all your web sites closely without lifting a finger and you'll be able

5
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.160
WBM you dev dot org.

6
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.620
I've got a nice blog post that was released actually three days ago according to the current date right

7
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.710
They do a nice review and a guide of several of these management platforms or management services giving

8
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.850
Most of these have a free level of service that you can use and see if you like it plug in a few sites

9
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.060
and you can continue to use it for free as long as you like with most of these.

10
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.400
And some of them have some premium add ons that you might want to take advantage of.

11
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:27.180
Eventually I use managed W.P. and their Orion service which is right over here.

12
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.070
This is their home page.

13
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.370
It's managed W.P. dot com and here's what it looks like.

14
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.810
Once I sign in my dashboard at managed W.P. shows me all the sites that are managed by this one single

15
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.950
some sites I have set up to be managed by managed W.P. Orion.

16
00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.540
I encourage you to read this post at WP you dev dot org as well as do your own research on what the

17
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.680
down here that talks about whether it's an external management or internal self-hosted option which

18
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.250
different Web sites that you manage these three are probably the best for that.

19
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.580
But I'd encourage you to do your own research and see what available options are out there.

20
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.640
We've talked about WGME you dev before as having a paid membership service which gives you access to

21
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790
lots of premium plug ins.

22
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.000
They have themes as well and a huge community of Wordpress experts I find it's real valuable for me

23
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.830
And at tracking level through their management plug in of all the different Web sites that are signed

24
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.990
go to any Web site and I can look at some different things like what plug ins that I have and need updating

25
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.880
I can have theme updates security performance and up time monitoring as well and ex-CEO as well as backups

26
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.720
I find that manage W.P. overlaps a bit of the services that my hub at WGME udev offers.

27
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.670
And so I just kind of take the best and what I like most from each of the services let's go through

28
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.010
I'm on the dashboard here where it shows me three different sites right down here.

29
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.350
look at which ones don't need an update.

30
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.190
Which ones are have updates available.

31
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.850
So under this managed plug ins tab you can see that I'm managing plug ins for two Web sites and it'll

32
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.940
show me of all the plug ins that managed W.P. is tracking on all my web sites.

33
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.850
Which ones are active on which web sites so I could select any of the plug ins by checking boxes here

34
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.570
and then either activate deactivate deactivate and delete or even update plug ins if it's necessary.

35
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.100
So I'll just hit this back button to go back to the dashboard screen over here on the left hand side

36
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.710
I can down here I can hide those filters and then appear if you click over view you can see that this

37
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:53.040
I've got a total of six plug ins and three themes and I could select all and update or click this update

38
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.800
all button on all of my web sites all at once.

39
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.150
It is a great timesaver if you're sure about compatibility issues and it's a very small update after

40
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.580
Of course I would go and check the Web sites to make sure everything's working right.

41
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.900
So suppose I got a notification that a certain plug in was having a security issue and it was recommended

42
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.870
pretty likely in my business.

43
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.700
I would be able to check the box over here and just update that plug in on every one of my web sites

44
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.730
using managed W.P. Orion.

45
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.230
Now how does this work if I'm logged in at the Wordpress dashboard at one of my web sites.

46
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.650
Skateboard coach dot com if I go up here and look at the Web sites list instead of this grid list I

47
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.930
The skateboard coach app is one of the Web sites that manage W.P. is managing for me.

48
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.360
And now over here it does tell me that I have to plug ins ready to be updated so click the updates button

49
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:08.940
Now how does manage WP Orion know that there are two plugins available for an update inside of my skateboard

50
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.910
coach app.

51
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.780
account.

52
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.050
This is all free to start out with and all the services I'm outlining here are within their free version.

53
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.240
So here it is the managed WP worker.

54
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.390
I went over to the search under plug ins and I typed managed W.P..

55
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.150
Here it is here.

56
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.770
The managed WP worker plug in.

57
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.910
They keep it updated and it's compatible with the latest version of wordpress.

58
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:49.300
It is just a great plug in that lets manage WP go and log in as you and make changes on your behalf

59
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.870
inside your Wordpress Web sites.

60
00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:00.040
If you're managing multiple Web sites in your business one of the great advantages is that you can log

61
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.830
That means you don't have to remember usernames and passwords or be forced to use the same username

62
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.990
and password for all of your client site accounts that manage W.P..

63
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:24.730
Well remember all those usernames and passwords for you if I just hit W.P. admin right here that will

64
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.540
It's actually a more secure way to log into your website dashboard because you don't even have to visit

65
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:44.460
the WP log in page and type in your username and password at all.

66
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.320
So let's take a look at managed W.P. in action very quickly.

67
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.260
You can see that I have to plug in updates on my skateboard coach app website.

68
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.620
It tells me that I'm using Word Press 4.6 which says there's no updates available for the WP or the

69
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.200
Now if I click these two I just select them there and click Update.

70
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.040
Now that it's finished I can see it gives me that nice message.

71
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.320
All the plug ins are up to date.

72
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.800
a look at what it tells us like that the plugins are all updated There's no message here.

73
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.330
Great.

74
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:47.330
These three themes again as in the last video instead of just go into them individually and deleting

75
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:59.090
I can do that a lot faster by going to manage W.P. dashboard and going over to the themes page here.

76
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:13.460
page for this Web site that I'm managing I can see that I have one active theme and three inactive themes.

77
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:19.850
Here's where I want to I can just check each of these themes and go down and delete all of them.

78
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.420
W.P. manage O'Brien will take care of that for me in one big group.

79
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.830
And it just makes it faster and easier.

80
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:33.790
Back in the Wordpress dashboard for the skate board coach app you can see I've updated the Wordpress

81
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.030
updates page and no more themes are there to update.

82
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:43.450
I could just go to appearance and themes and let's see what themes I have just the one current activated

83
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.840
theme is in my wordpress installation now that everything's updated on that Web site.

84
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:56.130
Let's just go through a few more things that manage WPA O'Bryan can do it can manage your users of which

85
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.480
on each of your web sites whenever you want.

86
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:17.970
Check right here these four and the fifth the backups feature are all part of their premium add ons.

87
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.350
It has different pricing and it's really very inexpensive.

88
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:32.410
All the things that are right here are free forever on an unlimited number of Web sites.

89
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:41.050
But if you go down here if you do per Web site or bundle them into over 25 Web sites you can see that

90
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.600
all these features are pretty affordable.

91
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:52.920
The managed W.P. service can do periodic backups and store them offsite separate from your server backups.

92
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:58.710
It can monitor up time and send you a text message or an email if one of your sites goes down.

93
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.880
and speed and performance report to your client as a part of your website care and maintenance plan

94
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.720
which will be going over and future videos and you can white label the service and the client reports.

95
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:23.250
So they don't know that you're using this service and it looks like it's just coming from your business.

96
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.760
Another couple of tools are down here.

97
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:31.530
Your own system info for each of your web sites at the server maintenance mode where if you're doing

98
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:41.840
of it with manage W.P. and the history of course of all your activity here and a way to roll back.

99
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.730
But in each one is the code snippets area we've looked at different ways to do code snippets where if

100
00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:00.360
snippets plugin so that you're not altering the theme itself but an interesting thing that you can do

101
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.090
a code snippet to all of your web sites at the same time.

102
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.120
This can be really useful for adding a personal message from your business.

103
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.020
Right on the Wordpress dashboard for your client.

104
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.670
Plus if you do something wrong and it breaks the site for any reason you can always remove the code

105
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:35.830
In this lesson I showed you what you can do to save time increase security and manage a group of web

106
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.280
This can really make your business and your client relationships better by providing an easy to administer

107
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.640
You'll learn how to create recurring revenue for your business this way later in the chapter in the

108
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.440
and how best to engage with them.

109
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.760
I'll show you how to make sure you take advantage of all your hosting company provides and set your
