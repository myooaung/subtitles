00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.390
In this video you'll learn how to automate backups of an entire WordPress site using third party services

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.160
and plug ins while your hosting company may provide periodic backups for your sites.

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.520
It's best to have redundancy or more than one backup in case something goes wrong.

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.020
By the end of this lesson you'll have several ways to set up automatic backups and offsite storage of

5
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.490
any site from your saved backups.

6
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.900
Let's start by getting on the same page as it were the same website page.

7
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.980
That is the same website dashboard that we've been working on inside of our logged in wordpress dashboard.

8
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.100
I'm at my womb comer's store site.

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.990
As you remember it's Greg Davis dot com slash MailChimp and I'm on the dashboard page here.

10
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.100
The video here if you need to and get logged in at your own WordPress site.

11
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.940
Now that were logged in let's go and open up that hardening WordPress article at Wordpress dot org again

12
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.170
and let's just scroll down to a place I have marked in the document by highlighting some of the text.

13
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.980
lesson database backups as well as file structure backups so the entire web site is backed up and ready

14
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.040
A sound backup strategy they say here could include keeping a set of regularly timed snapshots of your

15
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.830
So what that means is that you've got the database file and all the Wordpress core files the theme files

16
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.810
Basically your entire WordPress installation in a backup file in an external location separate from

17
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.620
It sounds a little complicated and it can be especially if you trying to do this manually on more than

18
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.720
Luckily there's plugins and third party services that we can use to take care of this automatically.

19
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.830
We were looking at I theme's security plug in in the last video and as you scroll down we mentioned

20
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.430
they have a third party service called backup buddy.

21
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.600
Now the themes backup buddy is a paid for service that is very excellent but there's a number of different

22
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.700
free plug ins are a good place to start.

23
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.070
But here's a good graphic on the themes that come back up buddy web page that talks about what makes

24
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.320
First you have a full site backup the database and the files included.

25
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.590
You store those backups offsite so that if your entire website and hosting company go down or out of

26
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.090
to a different server or to restore to the same server.

27
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.190
If your web site happens to go down we've also talked about WPA myu dev dot org.

28
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.320
The paid for premium plug in membership service that I'm a member of and one of their premium plug ins

29
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.800
It does all the things that we need to do in terms of taking offsite and timed and scheduled backups

30
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.080
and it is a premium plug in as a part of their membership service but just know that you can sign up

31
00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.360
You def get this snapshot pro plugin working and then you don't have to keep your membership.

32
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.010
You can still keep the plugin you just don't get support and or updates.

33
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.500
But I use snapshot Frot quite a bit for this very thing that we're talking about.

34
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.900
However let's go and look at two free plug ins in the Wordpress repository that accomplish this in a

35
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.530
Updraft Plus is one of the most popular WordPress backup plugins in the repository.

36
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.730
You can see looking down here it's got eight hundred thousand or more active installations.

37
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.480
They do have a premium version of their service but every thing we need comes with the free service

38
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.500
and updraft Plus is the plug in will be installing and configuring.

39
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.240
In this lesson.

40
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:59.140
than half a million active installations and another one with a premium version.

41
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:07.310
If you want to get back WPI up pro that has more features but like updraft plus the free version works

42
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.560
for everything I'll be teaching in this lesson.

43
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:18.560
So let's go into the dashboard of our live Web site and it looks like since I've been logged in for

44
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.810
my cell phone and I'm just pointing it at the screen here and all right.

45
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.630
My phone has buzzed that should lug me right back in to the Web site right now that I'm logged back

46
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.670
Follow long as I go to plug ins and the Add New button.

47
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.190
I'm going to be looking for updraft plus

48
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:57.130
am researching for the word updraft and there's the updraft plus WordPress backup plug in and I'll click

49
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.630
Now the new installing button with its circular Arrows is there and then it gives me an activate button

50
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.000
right in the ad plug in screen.

51
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.940
So now that I've installed updraft Plus I can go down and look at its buttons here on the plugin screen

52
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:20.110
I can hit the settings button but also under settings you've got the updrafts plus backups settings

53
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.610
We do need to set up a few things inside the configuration screen and that's by hitting the settings

54
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:46.190
to do these every week and I'm going to allow my external storage to keep a month's worth of backups

55
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.860
at a time before it deletes the old ones.

56
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.010
storage.

57
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.320
Now you can see there's a lot of different choices for remote storage here.

58
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.550
Dropbox if you'd like to follow along exactly how I do it in this video.

59
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.310
But feel free if you're a member of any of these other services to go and use them for your third party

60
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.540
A couple of these are part of their premium service and they do Dropbox for free.

61
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.700
in your browser and either sign up for or log into your Dropbox account.

62
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.140
Dropbox will give you two gigabytes of free storage before you need to upgrade.

63
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.970
Web site backups.

64
00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.960
So back in my dashboard since I'm already logged into Dropbox it'll be easy to authenticate with Dropbox

65
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:09.490
and now it says that all I have to do is save this page and I'm going to go ahead and include everything

66
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.480
in the in the backup files and I'll go back down and you can set it to send you an e-mail once it makes

67
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.540
This is a good way to collect those emails and then use them as a part of a client report.

68
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.860
If you're using Web site care plans that we'll talk about later in the course.

69
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:35.120
So I'll just click Save changes and then as I went up here and after it saved my changes gives me a

70
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.140
with Dropbox and upload those backup files to my personal storage offsite.

71
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.130
So since I'm already logged into Dropbox I can click allow right here and that's all there is to it.

72
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.790
It's scheduled itself to do a backup.

73
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.840
But what we can do in order to test the settings and make sure everything is working right is let's

74
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.040
So it's saying include the database.

75
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.770
Include the files in the backup.

76
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.960
And then I want to send this backup to remote storage.

77
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.780
along on your own web site and I'll pause the video and started back up when my backup is complete.

78
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.420
OK.

79
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.430
It looks like my latest log method says the backup apparently succeeded and is now complete.

80
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:49.610
And if I go over to my Dropbox folder you'll see that I now have an apps folder I open that up.

81
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:56.780
I have an updraft plus folder and inside that are some segments of my backup.

82
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.380
If you look at each one of these by clicking in an open area and then looking at the top you can see

83
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.260
we'll use in case you need to restore one of your backups.

84
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.200
Back inside the Wordpress dashboard you can go Under the existing backups tab shows that I have one

85
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.520
that I can perform using this particular backup.

86
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:43.000
The last thing we'll do in this lesson is test the restoration process to make sure that it's working.

87
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:53.140
So to test a backups restoration Let's go into our pages all pages and let's look at the thank you for

88
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:08.860
I'll just open that page and I'll just hit enter and say this is a site edit before restore.

89
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.560
Just typing some words right here and updating this page.

90
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:21.270
Now I know that if I restore the backup that was created before I made this edit and this line will

91
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.360
And so here is what I'll do I'll just right click on the permalink here and I'll say Open link in New

92
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.920
Thank you for confirming page on my live Web site.

93
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.480
And here's the line.

94
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:46.880
So let's go back into our WordPress dashboard and let's go and restore the last backup.

95
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.290
So we'll just go under settings go to updraft plus backups.

96
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:06.540
when I go over here and click restore and I can restore even any of the parts just the database the

97
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:13.650
So when we'll do this test let's go ahead and just restore everything and then we'll check out make

98
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:23.040
So a click restore right here and it looks like it's restoring the backup it's retrieving and preparing

99
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.140
Now there's one more step now that it's done that gives me a little report and it says OK.

100
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:39.660
So now I need to press restore again to precede or click restore and everything has begun.

101
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.840
It gives me some final checks and a report here.

102
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:50.060
And as I go back down I can see that it's done a lot of different things plug ins theme's uploads database

103
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.990
etc. and at the bottom here does restore successful.

104
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.790
And then you can return to updrafts plus or anywhere you like within the site.

105
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:07.760
But if I just go back to my thank you page tab and refresh the page can see that this line disappears.

106
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:20.240
So anything that had been done after the backup is now gone including any kind of hacking or any kind

107
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.280
Now I know you might be thinking boy back in one of the chapters earlier in the course we went over

108
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.250
plug in.

109
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.330
Well there's two main differences in the utilities that we're using for this backup system and they

110
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:54.790
Not only can you schedule backups to happen on a daily or or weekly basis.

111
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.920
and save them on your client's behalf.

112
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.260
In this lesson you learned how to create automated scheduled backups of an entire WordPress Web site

113
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.840
including the database and file structure and you set it up so that the backup files are saved to an

114
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:25.440
Now you can have multiple redundant backup systems set up for each of your client web sites which adds

115
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.150
a Web site from a previous backup in case of any problems in the next video.

116
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:42.780
You'll learn how to set up your Wordpress Web sites using HTP S and S S L or secure sockets layer doing

117
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.770
and inspiring confidence to Web site users.

118
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:57.870
It also allows your server to use the HTP to protocol which is another smart way to speed up your web
