1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,550
In this lesson I'll introduce you to a local development environment that you can use for free.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,040
Specifically designed for Wordpress will set up our first WordPress Web site of the course and start

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,130
and Mac.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,010
You don't need a flywheel hosting account to use it and it allows you to practice and test WordPress

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,610
By the end of this lesson you'll have a working WordPress Web site you can play with and a fast way

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,710
Let's get started.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,240
First open up a browser and go to local DOT get flywheel dot com.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,480
you can look through all the features and and things about it.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,330
But what I want you to do is click the download button and then choose whether you're on Mac or on Windows

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,680
local flywheel works almost exactly the same on both platforms.

11
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,970
Even the file locations are in a very similar location.

12
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,290
So click your platform and fill out your information and click get it now.

13
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,200
Now it's about a half a gigabyte 500 megabytes of a file so it might take a little while but once you

14
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:38,310
a video now and install local buy flywheel and I'll see you back here once you've installed local buy

15
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:46,620
Go ahead and navigate to the application you're in Windows or on your Mac might be in your applications

16
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:57,960
You can actually just leave all the settings as is and when you start the actual program it it'll give

17
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,660
Now this is a server environment installed on your own personal computer WordPress.

18
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:15,270
As I went over before needs to have a server as if it were hosted in a live environment.

19
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,810
That means it needs to be able to communicate with a database as well as store files and serve them

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,040
to a browser like chrome or Firefox.

21
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:39,540
oh what about 25 seconds and you could see that I have a few sites already installed in my local environment.

22
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,690
You won't have any when you first start but down at the bottom left here you can click the plus sign

23
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,200
and click the plus sign and then lets go through the options first.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,930
Choose a name

25
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,330
and the name is fine if you want to look at the advanced options you can and you can specifically choose

26
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,290
I like to use the default and then creating a site from a blueprint is something that will go over later.

27
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,100
But this I don't have any blueprints created and I will set them up later.

28
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,410
And this just means that you can install WordPress with whatever themes or plug ins you usually use

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,010
and it will speed up your development process by using a blueprint to create all your new sites.

30
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,350
So hit the Continue button after you've chosen a name you can choose a custom type of installation with

31
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,230
you'll have a preferred version that it will have here.

32
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:57,680
Let's just go and use the defaults and hit continue and then you're going to be choosing your Wordpress

33
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,960
dashboard username and password specifically for this site.

34
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,970
Again you can set that as something that you always know is the default so that all your local environment

35
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,100
And then there's an email address that you can leave as the default.

36
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,000
It tells you that you can choose this site to be a WordPress multi-site installation which is different

37
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,310
Let's just leave it as a single site by not choosing anything there.

38
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,090
And then you click add site now.

39
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,790
It'll.

40
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:42,380
It'll open up a special window where you need to give your computer permission to do the things that

41
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,830
And this is true of other development environments as well.

42
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:54,560
You're changing some of the very core files in your computer so that you can serve web sites as if there

43
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,680
Now once you have this you can see that it's developing.

44
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,460
It's downloading and there it goes it will open up and it will start the site automatically just start

45
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,620
a stop button here by the site name as well as at the top right the stop sign.

46
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,040
And that will be green and have a start button.

47
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,890
If it's not started yet.

48
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,130
Now I'd have my practice site one that I just created selected here and you can see that there's a number

49
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,700
But for now leave everything at the defaults.

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,840
And if you do install more than one site after this it see that each one of these is how you select

51
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,140
So if you haven't yet stopped the video and go through that process creating your first WordPress site.

52
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:55,140
Now before we look at any of these features and options for the site in local buy flywheel Let's go

53
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,190
First of all let's just click View site.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,070
And if I scroll down this is the default WordPress theme called 20:17 and it comes with a big full screen

55
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,940
image.

56
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:26,830
You can see that mine is called Practice Dasch site Dasch one dot local using dot local.

57
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,350
that you that your browser might go out and try to get.

58
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,740
And so there is the Web site even we can go through and click on any of the active links you can see

59
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:03,180
And then down here the Metor widget which is on the sidebar is just a default site layout that comes

60
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:12,220
Now let's go back to the local buy flywheel interface and then this time let's click admin.

61
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,280
Now this will open the Wordpress administrator dashboard which is always either a log in page has the

62
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:28,980
W.P. dash log in dot ph P extension and then it redirects to what is the real WordPress dashboard address

63
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:39,590
So use the log in credentials that you had set up in local by flywheel and click log in.

64
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,070
Whoops got to remember your password.

65
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,920
And now this is the default WordPress dashboard screen.

66
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,230
There's a welcome screen here that gives you a few different links that you can do usually dismiss that

67
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,700
The home page of the Wordpress dashboard the name of your site is at the top left and if you roll over

68
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,440
I like to keep each of these sites open in a different tab in my browser as I have here so that it's

69
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,030
And you can see that the default the U R L or the address for the Wordpress dashboard is your site domain.

70
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:39,430
Slash W.P. dash admin and that's all there is to it you already have a fresh clean WordPress installation

71
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,980
here in your local development environment.

72
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,480
You don't have to be on the Internet.

73
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:50,890
You can use this on a flight or if you're not connected and build and practice WordPress Web sites.

74
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:57,850
Now if you're back at the local buy flywheel interface just to let you know it does have to be turned

75
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:09,040
And if your site is not quote unquote running on the web server itself and you go back into your browser

76
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,490
you'll see that if I just refresh that page without the site running it gives me a message local router

77
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,060
error.

78
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,670
is not running and the dashboard page also will not work.

79
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:40,510
Now when you first start and open up the practice site it might take a couple of minutes for it to get

80
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,350
But there you go even remember that I was logged in often if I go up here under my username and log

81
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,560
to just remember W.P. admin for the administrator.

82
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,590
So if I go to that Web site it redirects to the log in page I can click my log in.

83
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,180
I asked my browser to remember my credentials and now I would suggest you just click around a little

84
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,410
We're press now gives you WordPress events and news in one of the widgets on the dashboard here and

85
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,610
for you for meetings in your local area as well as local news.

86
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,140
the practice site is live now by default WordPress.

87
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:53,270
If you're logged in shows you an administrator bar across the top of even the live Web site.

88
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,430
And I like to go in and open my web site dashboard in a different tab.

89
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,790
Like I mentioned one of the things I like to do and this is up to you is go into my own user account

90
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,800
edit my profile.

91
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,830
And I'd like to uncheck the toolbar checkbox and then save my profile.

92
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,710
Now you'll see when I go back to the live Web site and refresh the page now it doesn't show that administrator

93
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,840
Go ahead and play with it yourself and know that you've got your first WordPress Web site up and running.

94
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,200
Let's get to it in the next few videos.

95
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,290
In this lesson we downloaded and installed local by flywheel.

96
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,350
One of the best local development environments available.

97
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,220
It allows you to create new WordPress installations very quickly for creating new sites to practice

98
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,330
We'll take a little tour of the Wordpress dashboard and the different pieces that determine what your

99
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,170
See there.
