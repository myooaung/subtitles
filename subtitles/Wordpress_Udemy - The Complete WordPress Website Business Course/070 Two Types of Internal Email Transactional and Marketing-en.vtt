00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.180
In this chapter will be learning three different types of e-mail that Web sites and web site owners

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.670
use to our e-mail systems that web sites use automatically or internally.

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.000
domain name.

4
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.710
Transactional email and marketing email.

5
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.600
By the end of this lesson you'll understand the differences and applications for these types of e-mail

6
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.120
Let's just start by defining the difference between transactional email and marketing email transactional.

7
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.480
Email is defined really well in this MailChimp knowledgebase article because they supply a service called

8
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:03.620
the opposite of bulk e-mail transactional sends specific messages to one person.

9
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.590
A good example in wordpress is when you click the forgot my password link on the log in page WordPress

10
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.390
will send you an email and that e-mail is a transactional e-mail.

11
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.640
One thing to remember is that even though it has that word transactional in it it doesn't have to have

12
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.890
a e-commerce transaction or some kind of financial component.

13
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.130
bulk e-mail transactional e-mail isn't required to include an unsubscribe link.

14
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.910
in wordpress so doesn't WordPress send transactional email just fine.

15
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.590
Well it certainly does.

16
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.600
And one of the reasons why you would use a third party service like male chimps mandrill or a number

17
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:28.710
keeps their IP addresses and their e-mail addresses secure authorized and authenticated you lessen the

18
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.890
We all know that millions of spam emails go out every single day and many of those are spoofing another

19
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.000
And you can get those IPs and those e-mail addresses and domain names blacklisted by Google and other

20
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.110
And that would be a very negative thing for your clients or your own web site.

21
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.500
There's certainly a lot of articles and recommendations from different Web sites that you can find on

22
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.210
sites and other web applications like Wordpress.

23
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.780
outgoing transactional email services are available if you Google him.

24
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.050
One is how to use Google's S-M T.P. server where if you have a free Gmail account you can use Google's

25
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.240
name being spoofed or being stolen from someone else's spam email.

26
00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.020
Here's a great article I found and it's how to use an SPF record to prevent spoofing and improve e-mail

27
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.390
reliability.

28
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.960
If you just search for any of these terms look for this article on Digital Ocean.

29
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.070
It's an excellent primer for learning about how to prepare your domain name and your website and prevent

30
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:26.140
Unintended spam messages with your domain I just mentioned that Google's S.M. T.P. server if you're

31
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.590
has a charge to it.

32
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.520
There's also two more excellent transactional email services that offer free plans that have plenty

33
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.970
Send grid is one that has a free plan that allows you to send up to 12000 emails per month and you can

34
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.190
And then another one is called Spark post and they'll allow you to send up to 100000 emails per month

35
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.380
on an ongoing basis for no charge and spark post actually has a WordPress plug in.

36
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.750
That makes it really easy to set up and connect with their API so that you can use their service for

37
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.160
There are also some other great transactional email services that do charge a little bit of money.

38
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:34.330
Transactional email service is called Mandrell and it just went from having a free level less than a

39
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.640
And so if you have a paid MailChimp account you can choose to sign up for Mandrell which is an excellent

40
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.990
Now flywheel the managed WordPress hosting company that I've highly recommended in this course has an

41
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.770
Now one of the things that you pay for when you sign up for a managed WordPress hosting account is at

42
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.360
flywheel they're using sand grid.

43
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.070
The excellent company I just talked about here to send emails from the Web site.

44
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.900
So because this is a managed WordPress host at flywheel you don't have to do any extra set up to get

45
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.480
a third party company like send grid to be sending out your transactional emails.

46
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:36.790
So you're not using the default WordPress ph mail system which can be spoofed and stolen for spam but

47
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.610
which is much more protected.

48
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.160
Now I use site ground for my cloud account I use iCloud account at site ground I should say to manage

49
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.870
at a certain IP address.

50
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.780
at site ground.

51
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.990
And because of that I'm able to customize using the control panel.

52
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.970
And here's the subpanel for my web site.

53
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.430
Greg Davis dot com and I've got in this control panel I've got all these services that I can use.

54
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.130
And basically this is one of those an example of a virtual private server or a VPN.

55
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.540
And so it's a little bit similar to a shared hosting account that I can pay one fee to get an unlimited

56
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.150
IP address.

57
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:52.660
And so I know I have to worry that this IP address will be spoofed in a spam situation but I am going

58
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:12.160
email system using both Gmail in one example and also using the Greg Davis dot com email server that

59
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.410
I manage some of my mailboxes for a small charge of $2 a month so that I have a lot of storage space

60
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:35.550
and a really professional service from a company that specializes in delivering email I'll also show

61
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.390
is another host that's very inexpensive.

62
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:59.790
Web sites live and I pay only $5 a month for an unlimited unlimited number of Web sites and cloud ways

63
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:09.460
provides an instance on the digital ocean servers which is really fast specific to WordPress hosting

64
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.940
and other CMS services.

65
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:18.910
But you can see that under Add-Ons in cloud ways they have a few different options for delivering email

66
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.990
transactional email through your Wordpress Web site.

67
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:28.870
You can use an S.M. T.P. add on to set up a good free Google G-mail like I'm going to show you how I

68
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:41.910
a lastic emails another service that's also a dollar a month per e-mail address.

69
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:49.370
So my personal and professional website at Greg Davis dot com I do have a number of different places

70
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.060
The most obvious one perhaps is on my logon page if I do a forgotten password.

71
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.050
But that's really a small part of what possibly might be sent out from your web site to individual users.

72
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:21.500
here I've got a it's a contact form seven plug in form and I get an e-mail that gets sent to me and

73
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:35.450
that their e-mail was sent and this is also an example of transactional e-mail.

74
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:42.080
So if you have a lot of people using your contact form there might be a lot of e-mails generated and

75
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.340
you can expand that idea into if you have a membership web site.

76
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:55.550
For example at W.P. death of course com each time a student signs up for their own sandbox site they're

77
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:05.780
And so depending on how many students or how many members sign up for a site or even if you have a membership

78
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.610
But they've become members and users of the Web site to access protected content as a part of their

79
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.610
You're going to want to use a number of different transactional emails for them and depending on how

80
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.470
installation.

81
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:37.880
And it's a best practice to send those transactional emails with an authenticated SPF record behind

82
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:45.330
And from a proven third party service so that those have the most deliverability possible.

83
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.600
You don't want any of those transactional emails going into someone's spam or junk folder.

84
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:03.950
happen if you're sending emails from your domain name and somebody tries to use your domain to send

85
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:13.380
So I'm going to ask you to practice the techniques we're going to be setting up and using in this chapter

86
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:21.120
on a live web server so that the e-mail systems are live and you can send e-mail from the server straight

87
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:33.850
see what's going on in the background with e-mails that are being sent from WordPress.

88
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:41.190
So whether it's at site ground with an inexpensive shared hosting program as an intro or if you have

89
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:55.800
cloud which is com or a managed host like flywheel I'll be recommending that you make sure and get a

90
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:08.160
Now both flywheel at get flywheel dot com and cloud ways offer limited time free trial and the trial

91
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.180
demo site that you can use and build for coursework here that might be the best option.

92
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:31.680
Floodways on some of their systems especially the ones that are hosted at Digital Ocean give you a two

93
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.510
programs.

94
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:52.340
Like I said I use a cloud account at site ground for my business and I also use the managed flywheel

95
00:13:52.350 --> 00:14:00.270
hosting as a bulk plan for my larger traffic sites and my larger sites so that it's managed for me and

96
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.640
Now you can see in this flywheel help document if you read a little bit further down that they do not

97
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.310
party service like MailChimp and others and I 100 percent agree with that.

98
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:28.430
If you search around the internet you'll find a lot of information about whether to use Wordpress or

99
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:41.150
And it's definitely not recommended if you use transactional e-mail systems like the one included in

100
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.790
wordpress or even third party systems like send grid or Mandrell.

101
00:14:50.690 --> 00:15:00.350
Instead MailChimp is an excellent bulk and newsletter and you might say marketing email system and I

102
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:09.680
They have a free level of service where you can have up to 2000 contacts for your autoresponder and

103
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:22.250
If you go down a little bit further on my home page you can see that I've got a form here and that's

104
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.460
name last name and e-mail are going to come from mine.

105
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.150
MailChimp account and not from WordPress itself.

106
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:45.920
The big difference is that MailChimp and others are set up to send hundreds thousands or tens of thousands

107
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:50.330
even millions of e-mails to a group of people all at once.

108
00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.320
out newsletters or marketing and advertising pieces to bring business into the Web site.

109
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:06.980
Many of your clients will want a marketing email system and I highly recommend setting up MailChimp

110
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.270
it to your client WordPress Web sites and your own.

111
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:24.410
There's a lot of articles on the Internet that discuss this but I found a good one at WBM you dev dot

112
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:31.460
org in their blog are WordPress email marketing plugins worth considering and if you read the article

113
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.940
you'll find that you would only want to use an email marketing plug in to send marketing emails and

114
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:50.270
Or you're just starting out that best practice instead of using these plugins to send marketing emails

115
00:16:54.530 --> 00:17:00.220
The best practice is to use a third party bulk emailing system instead.

116
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:07.420
This video was an overview of transactional email and marketing email and how they are used within the

117
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.800
I'd recommend you keep up with current trends and best practices in the area of email because there

118
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.660
address in the next video.

119
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.910
We'll take a look at email systems that you might be more familiar with send and receive email systems

120
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:38.050
We'll be learning about how to set up email systems like these but for custom domain names in this way

121
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.160
Web sites you create can have their own systems around email addresses like.

122
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.570
Let's do it
