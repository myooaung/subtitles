1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,880
Now we'll delve back into your local development environment and check out the way Wordpress is installed

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,810
There are several default themes present with the newest one activated and a couple of standard plug

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,920
And there are a few that should be changed to use best practices in this video.

4
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,680
are important.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:39,400
Let's go first let's get set up with our local WordPress installation that we set up in the previous

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,590
I'm going to start map and it's already started so I can see the Apache server and the MiSeq will server

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:01,090
the web server tab and I can see that under-sea colon H.T. docs under the map folder is where I have

8
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,970
a WordPress installation will be the name of my web site.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,160
If you remember I set up WP of course one as my wordpress Web site.

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:28,870
But let's open windows explorer and if I look under C colon and in the map folder under H.T. docs you

11
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,130
If you open windows explorer you can go and see which folders you have and what are their names and

12
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,120
Web site as long as map is running.

13
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:56,960
Now in the default installation the maildir sidebar information is down here on the right hand side

14
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,920
and there is a log in button I'll usually right click on that and click Open link in New Tab and I already

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,530
So now I'm logged in to my fresh WordPress installation that has all the defaults set up and I'm now

16
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,580
I'm using WordPress in a local environment and it's going to be the fastest setup for creating new sites

17
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,380
and managing my coursework.

18
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:37,140
Go ahead and navigate to your own WordPress installation and we'll get started looking at the defaults.

19
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,710
First of all if you open the website itself you can see that this is the 2016 theme.

20
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,910
Let's go back to the tab.

21
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,620
Open up appearance and themes.

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,810
And look let's look at which themes come with wordpress at this point.

23
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,820
One is called 20:16 it tells me that it's the active theme.

24
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,050
If you click each of the theme details buttons you can look at what themes the current theme.

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,230
There's a few control buttons here but I don't usually use these control buttons to customize my websites.

26
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,140
I'll use the ones that are over here under appearance.

27
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,600
You can click the small arrow at the top left to go through the themes that are installed in your workplace

28
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,910
installation and look at that actual traits for each one of them.

29
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,360
And the X closes that modal window

30
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:55,630
if you rollover plugins and then click install plugins you can see that WordPress ships with two plugins

31
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,170
already installed.

32
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,700
Now they're not activated but they are installed Ekis meant prevents comment spam and hello Dolly is

33
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,000
And if we activate the Hello Dolly plug in you can see that it's very simple.

34
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,070
What it does is it gives you a quote from the Hello Dolly musical in the top of your dashboard.

35
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,020
Every time you go to a different page

36
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,590
Now this isn't a plug in.

37
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:40,130
You might go into the plug ins list which I often do and I delete that plug in I like to keep my dashboard

38
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,090
So once it's not activated you can hit delete and go ahead and delete the files.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,360
And then that plug it won't be in your play list anymore.

40
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,100
X-Men is a great plug in to activate once you've got your site set up and configured because if you

41
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,120
and emailing the managers and the administrators of the site.

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,110
For now all on building sites I just keep it in activated.

43
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:27,620
Now if I go up and roll over users and look at your profile you can see some information about your

44
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:42,680
When viewing site now by default WordPress has this checkbox enabled and if you go over to the Web site

45
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:55,490
dashboard and other places to manage your site as well as your user profile and log in and log out button

46
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,120
over here a member of the public wouldn't be seeing this toolbar so I prefer to go back and uncheck

47
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,830
the toolbar box.

48
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,740
Update my profile.

49
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:13,350
And then because I work between two tabs in my browser I can refresh the page and that toolbar disappears.

50
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,940
Thereby showing me the way the site would look to the general public.

51
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,470
Back in the dashboard if you click Settings general or just the Settings button you'll open the general

52
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,320
Initially the site title of course but then the tagline is a default tagline just on the wordpress site

53
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,850
you might change that to something more appropriate for your client.

54
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,950
The WordPress address of the site you are LDS are probably the same as what was set up when you were

55
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,750
All these are part of the defaults.

56
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,110
And as we roll down membership means that you can have people register as a user on the site and when

57
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,230
will go through as we go into making membership sites in the future I'll usually leave this unchecked

58
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,300
for a regular web site for a client.

59
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:25,290
I will change the time zone and not only the UTC times with the numbers but there are also time zones

60
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,480
in different cities across the world.

61
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,470
You can just type the first few letters of the largest city around and see if that is the same time

62
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,070
Denver is the one for me and I choose a date format a time format that fits with my country or my clients

63
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,910
And the language and let's save our changes.

64
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,050
When you say changes in wordpress you'll usually get an administrator message with a green bar here.

65
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,290
This one says settings saved.

66
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,840
You can always click the red X at the right side to close those messages.

67
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,520
Just a few more settings to go through.

68
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,370
If we check the writing settings page you'll see that as you make a post if you're doing a blog as a

69
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,880
We'll talk about the later video but in this theme they enable a number of different post formats whether

70
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,200
And then you can post via e-mail.

71
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:43,180
Meaning you can make an email address and when that e-mail address receives an email from you it will

72
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,130
will enable the notification of a service like ping or magic dot com.

73
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:03,740
And this is good for search engine optimization and notifying Web sites around the Internet that you

74
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:16,370
under reading this is a setting's page that controls how your website visitors will approach your website.

75
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:24,770
Your latest posts or a static page and what I'm going to do right now is select a sample the front page

76
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:33,200
It's one of the default pages called sambil page and I'm going to change that from your local Post's

77
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,260
in a subsequent video.

78
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,380
a static page as the front page in order to have that Web site be appropriate for the client.

79
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,730
There's a few blog settings pages and I usually use these at their defaults and then while I'm building

80
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,780
company.

81
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:15,270
through the internet but I click save changes for my front page display settings discussion has to do

82
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,940
And there's a few settings you can read through here if you're going to have a blog section on your

83
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,260
Under media depending on what theme you are using these are the standard image sizes that get created

84
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,470
when you upload a photo or an image to the media library.

85
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,830
I usually leave these at their defaults unless I'm looking to match my column with or the body text

86
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,130
And at that time I might change this to the appropriate size so that every time I upload an image it'll

87
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,380
library.

88
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:15,980
Or you can leave all of your images inside of the media library which is a folder called uploads and

89
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,520
But oftentimes I will just uncheck the organize my uploads box as I'm building the site and potentially

90
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,740
and posts I'll recheck that for future uploads.

91
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,540
Lastly permalink are the you are Elle's that your site is using now.

92
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,380
It's very important actually that you check an appropriate box right here.

93
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:51,190
Post name is currently the most popular permalink setting for Wordpress posts.

94
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,090
and posts appear in the URL.

95
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:08,530
So click Post name and then save changes in terms of the categories and the tags which will go over

96
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,720
The category default base your L word is called Category But there's an explanation here if you use

97
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:29,660
name is tag is the default word for the tag base.

98
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,590
the theme looks and there's a hello world post where if you open that up you can just see one sentence

99
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,270
Welcome to WordPress.

100
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:56,150
Then start writing and you could see that our permalink structure has propagated through the site and

101
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:04,770
it's got the post name here after the website address if you click pages all pages you'll see that there's

102
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:11,840
also a sample page that comes up and you can see that from our settings under reading when we set a

103
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,640
in that other setting.

104
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,360
Finally there is a default comment that comes up and all three of these pages are something that you

105
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,640
In this video you've opened up your local WordPress installation looked at the defaults and changed

106
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,180
In the next chapter you'll build your first client say a simple brochure website using the default theme

107
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,020
and a few extra plugins.

108
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,800
See you there.
