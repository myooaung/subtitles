00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,150
The ability to back up move around and restore WordPress sites is super important for managing a WordPress

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,140
Plug ins can make it easy in this video you'll migrate the local site you just built into another local

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,950
I'll show you a few plug in options that I use for moving WordPress sites around for development and

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,060
By the end of this video you will have made a complete and full backup copy of a WordPress site and

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,610
Let's get started.

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:41,500
We're going to be moving the last site that we were working on in the 2014 theme and if you don't have

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:56,040
Make sure that you start map and then go to your u r l there and also go to the Admin Page and log in.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,290
It would also be convenient if you had the start page open in your browser like I do over here for maps

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,530
so that we can access the database we'll be using it to access the database.

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,330
If you're using your site Ground server go ahead and log in.

11
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,210
You can click my accounts and then go to the see panel and from there you can scroll down to files and

12
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,830
I've done that over here.

13
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:32,760
You can also access the databases by going over here and clicking ph PMI admen.

14
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,960
Let's open the Wordpress dashboard and go down to plug ins and click add new I've already installed

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,830
But I'm going to go ahead and recommend that you install this plug in it's called all in one W.P. migration.

16
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,490
You can do a search for it by using the term all in one migration and I could see it comes up over here.

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,490
Updated recently compatible with this latest version of wordpress.

18
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:07,450
More than 100000 active installations with a lot of good reviews so I'm confident that I can use that

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,500
So I've installed it and then I activated it.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,820
And if we go over here under all in one menu it's only got a few options of backups.

21
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:28,250
Screen that you can see the backups that you've made and an export and import screen if you have that

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,620
Go ahead and roll over the menu and open the export page.

23
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,910
It gives you just a few options.

24
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,160
And what we're going to do is actually just choose a place to export it to file.

25
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,780
And then it's preparing to export and it's going to go through its process and then we'll be able to

26
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,930
That took just a few seconds somewhere under a minute and now it gives us the ability to download that

27
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,500
Let's go ahead and download it.

28
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,160
it's sixty nine point seven megabytes.

29
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm going to move it out of my downloads folder and into a folder called brochure site where I can keep

30
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,310
So I'll open up my downloads folder in Windows Explorer along with my desktop here.

31
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,600
And I've got that brochure site folder that I created before when we were creating images.

32
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,340
So I've got the local host brochure site backup file.

33
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,860
That type is a W. press file a file type that they create.

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,670
So now we need a new fresh WordPress installation to install this backup into.

35
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,820
So here's a challenge for you as long as you have map running.

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,590
Go ahead and move the word press corps files into a new folder in the map H.T. Docs folder create a

37
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:27,960
by navigating to WordPress at that new URL s.a.a how to go.

38
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,610
Did you get a new site installed.

39
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,310
Well here's how I would go about doing it.

40
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,370
I'm going to go ahead and go to Windows Explorer again and let's see I need the latest version of Wordpress

41
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,380
unzipped and there are my word press corps files for four point five point two over here I'm going to

42
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,760
3.

43
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:17,080
And you can see that I've tested this through migration one and two but in migration 3 I'm going to

44
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,660
here and my wordpress folder and paste them over here.

45
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:36,580
Now that I have that copied over I'm going to rename the WP dash config dash sample file to just W.P.

46
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:45,990
dash config and then what I've done in Adam my text editor my code editor is I've been able to open

47
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,880
If you just open up a folder that has files that you want to edit and call it a project folder.

48
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,790
If I do that with migration 3 then it will show me all those files within migration 3 that I might want

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,040
So if I just click W.P. config dot ph P It's in migration 3 I can verify that.

50
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,640
Now I know I need to put in my data in database name username and password and change the local host

51
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,850
port number.

52
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:25,280
So let's go back to map to the start page and we'll create a database under Tools ph my admin or there's

53
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,380
And that will open up your database.

54
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,910
I'll just click new over here.

55
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:42,880
And I'll think of a name just to match the site I'll use migration 3 so I know which is which and I'll

56
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:53,170
Now that that database has been created I know that using manf I am just going to use the standard log

57
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,970
As the database user.

58
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,150
So it's going to be migration migration 3.

59
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,080
The username is route and the password is route.

60
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:16,210
And I know that the local host needs a call in and the port number 33 6 if you remember port numbers

61
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,040
up here 33 06 or if you're on the map start page

62
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,170
then it's down here.

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,890
I'll go back to the database though.

64
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:41,070
There's nothing else I need to do here but I'll just take a look at migration three can see that there

65
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,020
those tables.

66
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:02,810
slash migration three as long as Wordpress can connect to the database.

67
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,630
It'll work.

68
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,540
It looks like something's wrong.

69
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,780
Do you know what it is.

70
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,240
Well when I was editing my file I put in all my data but I failed to save it.

71
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,580
If I was on a life server but all I have to do is save that file and it's in my file structure here

72
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:40,500
Now it's going to the database go through the real fast WordPress installation settings

73
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,430
great hit the log in button in my browser is going to remember the password because I use the same one

74
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,740
There we are.

75
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,790
Hope you were able to manage that as well.

76
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,060
to start.

77
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,260
So I bet you can guess what we do next.

78
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,120
I'll click Install now.

79
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,670
Activate the plug in.

80
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,170
And then all you've got to do is import the file that we export it from the other installation.

81
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:55,040
I'm going to import from a file and if I go to my desktop again I can find that brochure site folder.

82
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,130
Here's the file if I just click open it's starting to import and I'll pause the video as it does so

83
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,130
once it's uploaded the file and gone through a couple of import process settings.

84
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,440
It'll give you this warning.

85
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,270
It's going to overwrite the database media plugins and themes.

86
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,580
So you want to make sure that if this wasn't a blank site or if you were overwriting another site that

87
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,810
Your data has been imported successfully.

88
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,970
Great.

89
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,380
it'll open a new tab if you do that through it through that link.

90
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:50,360
And this is something for at this point you'll need to log in again with the previous site's credentials.

91
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,470
If they're not the same but because this is the new site now.

92
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,720
So I've still got the same settings under permalink but I've got to save it.

93
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,090
And then the plug in.

94
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,050
This is probably making changes to the HD access file which will go over in later videos.

95
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,930
But that's how we control the redirects of the permalink settings.

96
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:27,340
I could close this and now that I'm logged in over here on the new site where I change my permalink

97
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,730
I can go and make sure everything is all good I'm going and right click and open this in a new tab.

98
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:43,820
You can see that I'm in the new you are l migration three from over here is the old Jaro brochure dash

99
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,860
There's the site looks great.

100
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:58,830
One of the things that the plug in does is up here if you remember we made this home button in the old

101
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,980
menus was through a custom link and a fixed you RL.

102
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:19,650
So if we look under that custom link on the old site was the u r l and so at the new site this has actually

103
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:30,360
What that tells me is that under appearance menu here when the plug in made the migration it actually

104
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,010
had the old u r l and it replaced them with the new R L.

105
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,710
Making this home button work.

106
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,700
So now we've got a complete copy of that original site at a New York.

107
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:58,970
A whole new WordPress installation including all the media all of the whole database structure and including

108
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,840
That's an easy way to migrate a site between local hosting and a live host where you're going to be

109
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,140
and an exact copy on your local computer to make fundamental changes without breaking the live site.

110
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,210
And then when it's done you can migrate it right back up and overwrite the live site.

111
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,960
In this video you migrated a whole WordPress Web site from one Yoro to another.

112
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:47,950
modifying the W.P. config file using a free plug in you were able to make a backup file of the entire

113
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,320
We'll get right down into the files and database and migrate the site completely manually.

114
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,350
No matter where it's hosted.

115
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,080
Let's go
