00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,120
In this lesson you'll create your own child theme using the standalone theme we used from Automattic

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,720
as the parent theme by using your code editor and a few snippets of code you'll manually create your

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,700
Here's where you'll make any code edits to customize the site using best practices by editing the child

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,490
Let's start by just reviewing what a child theme is here from WordPress dot org a child theme is a theme

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,670
the recommended way of modifying an existing theme.

6
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,490
Now we went over that in the last video.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,240
But if you scroll down on the same page there's a little bit of instruction about how to create a child

8
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:54,440
You can also find a lot more detail if you Google something like how to create a child theme in wordpress.

9
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,130
You'll come up with a lot of different tutorials to do it.

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:07,730
You do need a code editor like Adam that we've used in the past and I have a favorite tutorial that

11
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,100
Inside their blog and it gives you a lot of good little code examples and tells you exactly the steps

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:29,240
Just like the word press Darrig this article tells you that you just need three things and it's true.

13
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,470
First you need a child themed directory which is basically a folder called Something child.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:44,060
And then you need two files inside of it style that CSSA and functions dot THP each one needs to be

15
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:54,680
And then you can add your CSSA styles or your functions dot ph peacoat code snippets that you might

16
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,540
Here's a challenge for you.

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,230
Go ahead and open up.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,480
Start map or whatever you're using for your local development environment and open up your fire weed

19
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:20,750
Open up the Wordpress dashboard and look at the themes and then go ahead and look at the Wordpress Codex

20
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:29,110
at Kodak's dot WordPress dot org slash child underscore themes or Google one of the tutorials maybe

21
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:45,060
of this one called affinity and activate it plus the video now and see if you can do it.

22
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,460
I hope you did well with that if you did create a child theme correctly.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,830
You should have a nother theme available here.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,790
Probably with just a blank screen shot and the name of your child theme.

25
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,720
Here's how I would go about it.

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,030
First I'm going to go to a Windows Explorer and open up the folder that contains my wordpress files.

27
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,200
If you remember this one is called Live site.

28
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:24,660
So there's my wordpress core file structure and within the content and themes.

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:39,720
As a new folder and I'm going to call it exactly the name of the theme that I want to create the child

30
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,550
So I call it affinity W.P. come dash child

31
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,080
create.

32
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,030
Now within that folder I've got a place to files if you remember back here at the child themes how to.

33
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:11,870
I need a style that CSSA and a function's dot BHP so I'll just go to my code editor called Adam and

34
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:25,190
I can actually go to the content themes and in this folder I could right click and say I want a new

35
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,350
going to be within the child themed folder and I'm going to call it style dot see SS

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
in order to find the code I need to place inside style.

37
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:55,260
Thus VSS I can go back to WordPress data work and just copy and paste this.

38
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:04,870
This example code Control-C for copy and I'll just paste it right at the top there and I'll just edit

39
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,150
There's really only two if you actually do go back here.

40
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,970
There's two that are required for a child theme out of this style that CSSA code at the top.

41
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:30,400
It's the theme name and the template but you can go ahead and use the whole amount of code and just

42
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,010
WP SEO and.

43
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:48,450
Now how do I know that it's the name of the folder where the theme files reside affinity dash W.P. come

44
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,800
great.

45
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,740
Otherwise I can leave the leave it the same.

46
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,270
theme you are I everything else doesn't really matter I could put my own name if I want to on the description

47
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,290
The way this control asked to save.

48
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,370
OK so that is the first file.

49
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,870
The second one I need is called functions that ph p.

50
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,770
Again I'm going to go into affinity W.P. come child.

51
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:50,230
All right click on that folder and click new file and it's going to be called functions a dot ph P and

52
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,380
Here it is right here and you do have to place a certain piece of code in the functions up DHP a file

53
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
that your child theme has to enqueue the styles from the parent theme.

54
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,210
Now where am I going to get that code again.

55
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,780
Back at Wordpress dot org.

56
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,940
I could go down and find the queuing styles.

57
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,220
You can read a little bit about more detail here.

58
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,680
In this case this is going to be enough because there's just one style that CSSA file in the parent

59
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:37,810
So if I hit Control C from here and go back into my code editor paste that directly into functions dot

60
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,340
ph P Now you just need the starting ph p tag.

61
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,940
But you the finishing when you can keep adding other functions that BHP style snippets or code snippets

62
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,520
editing the parent theme.

63
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,060
It functions up HPL just had control S for Save make sure both of these are saved.

64
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,810
And now I can go back and activate my child theme.

65
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,220
There is a bit more to understand but that is enough to get us going.

66
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:22,970
If I go back into my themes page and hit refresh in my local installation I should see my second theme

67
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,040
And because I've defined it as a child theme of this affinity theme everything should work perfectly

68
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,940
great.

69
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,210
That theme has been activated and let we hit refresh on the live site

70
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,830
great.

71
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,820
It works exactly the same way obviously and you've probably noticed the way this theme with the default

72
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:57,050
images is set up as it has a random image that comes up for the home page and for some other pages every

73
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:09,400
let's finish up by making one more change within the style does CSSA file of our child theme and we'll

74
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,080
Maybe we could choose something down here on the footer.

75
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,340
Maybe I can make those a bright white instead of this low gray the way I'd find out what the CSSA styles

76
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:47,980
inspector the inspector something when this is activated inside of this Firefox utility that when I

77
00:09:53,140 --> 00:10:00,470
Here's the actual markup code on the right and down here at the bottom are the CSSA styles.

78
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:08,860
So I can see that there the let's see this is defined as a border that's one pixel that's solid and

79
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:19,370
So if I take this whole style element called Dot widget title that's a class along with the first bracket

80
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,990
I'm going to start out the code block by doing that and then I'll hit enter to the next line.

81
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,350
I'll go back over here and inside of the brackets.

82
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,250
Copy that and place that in my code here.

83
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,140
Then enter one more time and I just need a closing bracket.

84
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,650
And great.

85
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,200
hexadecimal codes.

86
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,970
You can go to Photoshop or Pichler one of those image editors and pick a color and find out what its

87
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,480
So I hit control as to save and just a check.

88
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,950
Nothing has changed within the style sheet of the parent theme.

89
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:44,130
because we were able to cue the styles in the functions up DHP Well let's go back to our website and

90
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:53,550
If I just close the inspector and refresh the page since I saved that style that CSSA file.

91
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,560
Well sometimes you might have to do a little bit of experimentation because I can see that didn't change

92
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:10,750
So I did go back into the web developer toolbar and open the inspector actually.

93
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,990
And when I look at this area I also see that there's a dot footer widgets there's a footer widgets its

94
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:28,740
So if I take that footer widgets class and paste it right in front with a space for widgets and widget

95
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,860
So I get control S and save it.

96
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,990
Turn off the web developer and let's see if I refresh.

97
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,210
What that does to the border of the footer titles.

98
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,460
Nice nice and white.

99
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:55,100
And we can see that that's only been done to the child theme not the parent theme.

100
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,750
So when they release affinity 1.1 or 1.5 or 2.00 I'll be able to update infinity.

101
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:08,520
Still get all the newest stuff when they update the theme but my changes will still be preserved because

102
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,530
In this video you created your own child theme using the affinity theme as a parent.

103
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,140
Then you activated it and made a change to the style that CSSA file to change the web site without touching

104
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:33,260
Nice job in the next video you'll create a child theme using a plugin which can make it slightly easier.

105
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,280
again without touching the parent theme.

106
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,070
So either
