1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,930
In this video you'll use the themes built in scrolling home page navigation tags and build the footer

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,970
pages of the theme using the Genesis theme settings and sidebar widgets.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,510
We'll also check out the inner workings behind the scrolling home page navigation in our local environment

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,730
You'll understand how anchor tags can provide a beautiful and useful navigation structure for scrolling

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,320
For starters make sure you have the caf theme site open inside the student's sandbox.

6
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,840
Make sure that when you roll over the site it's your cafe themed site and you can see your list of sites

7
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:04,140
First let's take a look at the menus that were imported using our X-amount import that we got from the

8
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,910
If I click appearance menus usually the edit menus tab is the first one selected but if not go ahead

9
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:28,930
the menu is the menu that I created and was part of the default parallax installation just to give an

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,050
As you remember all of these were just a custom link with NO YOU Arel except a hash tag they didn't

11
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:53,990
The other two menus that came in with our SML import are called primary navigation that one has an about

12
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,940
with a dropdown with a bunch of different sub items that came in as pages as a part of our import.

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,740
And then there's a few custom links menu mission mantra location.

14
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,470
dot com slash Cafe site dema.

15
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,150
And if you remember we looked at these menu items before they they have a standard you are l and then

16
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,500
Front Page 1 from page 2 from page 3.

17
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:42,890
So if you look at the navigation menus page for cafe inside of the studio press member area I'll just

18
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,710
We've got a primary navigation menu that goes after the head menu and then there's also a footer menu

19
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,450
further.

20
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:07,280
You'll see that they recommend that you use a custom u r l for these menu items and you call it your

21
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,870
dash widgets back inside the student's sandbox.

22
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:26,670
You'll see that these custom you aureoles are actually populated with relative Your else rather than

23
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,860
the absolute you are else here.

24
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,200
Absolute just means they go all the way from the HTP and include it for using the whole domain name.

25
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:44,610
A relative you are l is just a slash and then the ending part of the inside of Wordpress menus.

26
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,500
You can use relative you or else like this but because this was part of the cafe demo the way we imported

27
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,250
each page.

28
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:10,650
So to make these work we'll have to edit out that slash cafe and for each of these menu items go ahead

29
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,900
and take out the slash cafe but leave slash hash tag front page 3 and all the other appropriate or else

30
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,370
go ahead and pod.

31
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,630
Pause the video now navigate to the menus area and make that change.

32
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,460
Don't forget to scroll to the top and click save menu at the right hand side when you're done.

33
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:37,180
OK don't forget to go up to the about link as well which is pointing to the hash tag.

34
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:50,330
I click save menu on the right hand side and then what I'd like to do is push put this into the primary

35
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,450
If I scroll down to the bottom of this menu I can check the primary navigation menu box and then click

36
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,320
As you remember you can also manage the menu locations using the tab up here.

37
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,880
We've already set primary navigation menu to the assigned menu.

38
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,120
Primary navigation.

39
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:19,280
Let's go to our site and refresh the page and see how our relative your L's are working inside of the

40
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,140
Great now if I use the scrolling wheel or the scroll bar at the top I can see that the menu comes to

41
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,300
Now I scroll back to the top I can see that if I use this menu item about I'll go to this about section

42
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,420
and there's front page 2 Front Page 3 etc..

43
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,170
Nice.

44
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,400
Your next challenge is to populate this bottom footer menu with the menu that was imported with our

45
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,080
If we look at a site demo again and scroll all the way to the bottom you can see that it was a social

46
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,500
Go ahead and go back to the menu page and populate that menu into this footer menu area.

47
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,900
Good luck How did it go.

48
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,120
Did you get the proper menu populated into the right place.

49
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,880
Well here's how I would do it.

50
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,430
OK there's the footer navigation menu and if I open it up I think the secondary menu is the right one.

51
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,590
I'll save the changes and we can look at it.

52
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,940
But if we were sure you might have gone back to the edit menus tab and looked at that secondary navigation

53
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,920
contact page menu and it's the right one.

54
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,700
So if I go back to the Web site in the other tab and read and refresh rate I've got the menu down in

55
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:13,630
Now you may have found that you tried out the secondary navigation menu as a location and in fact when

56
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,270
tell you the secondary menu location is not used inside of the theme demo.

57
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,680
If I scroll to the top you may have found if you tried to activate that menu that your social menu came

58
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,310
You may have found that.

59
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:45,040
But just to show you if I do activate say that secondary navigation into the secondary navigation menu

60
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:54,470
and click save changes you'll see that that puts that menu at the top below this widget which is that

61
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:03,980
But above the header image here and it scrolls away and disappears when you scroll unlike the primary

62
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:14,060
So I go back and just deactivate that secondary menu location by clicking select a menu and then saving

63
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:25,850
Now my site doesn't use that secondary navigation menu location back inside of our live site tab.

64
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,770
Let's scroll down a little bit and look at a sample page.

65
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:43,660
that these pull images aren't working the same way as they were inside the parallax theme but they do

66
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,840
There's also a menu inside of the primary side bar widget location.

67
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,700
Let's go back and look inside of appearance widgets.

68
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:08,670
And we can see that this custom menu which used to be populated inside of the head or widget area it

69
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:18,300
Well when we change the theme from parallax to Cafe pro that widget got stuck inside of the first widget

70
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:31,650
So that is a custom menu that I brought from over here this custom menu widget that we can use and the

71
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,000
header menu is the one that was selected.

72
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,220
I can delete that or bring it over and place it down here in the inactive widgets if I like.

73
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:51,400
If I don't have a primary sidebar item and I refresh the page you'll see that it just gives us a default

74
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,680
we wanted a full screen layout instead of using the sidebar area on interior pages.

75
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,180
width layout instead of using a content and a sidebar column plus a video now and give it a try.

76
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,130
I hope you did well with that.

77
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,240
Here's how I would go about changing from the two column layout to the full width single column layout.

78
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,530
I go back to the Wordpress dashboard.

79
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:36,230
What I'm looking for is under Genesys theme settings because we're using Genesys we've got this default

80
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,530
layout selection under Genesys theme settings.

81
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:56,310
Let's check it out by opening the site again and refreshing the page nice.

82
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:11,950
but they do enable a nice lay out with align left and align right in a single page.

83
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm going to finish this lesson with posing a challenge for you.

84
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,140
If you remember in our local site which I had called Live Dasch site and we built out as a photography

85
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:39,700
on the home page as we scroll down past the featured image on the home page we have recent posts three

86
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,590
two and one on the home page.

87
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,750
However the affinity theme has a home page design with Page panels.

88
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,450
along with scrolling navigation using diamonds on the right hand side.

89
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,610
Your challenge is to go find the Wordpress dot com affinity theme.

90
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:16,580
It is at Wordpress dot com slash themes slash affinity and also use map to activate your local development

91
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,160
Open the Wordpress dashboard so that you can go ahead and use this to make your changes.

92
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:35,690
But what I'd like you to do is to activate the panels inside of the affinity theme here and you can

93
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,590
and following them.

94
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,120
It might help to take a look at the theme demo using this link at the top right and have it open in

95
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,020
You can see that on the right hand side.

96
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,240
page there.

97
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,760
They're scrolling navigation works a little bit differently as you scroll down the different and Dimond's

98
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:16,990
light up or become gray as you scroll down and you can also use them as clickable links.

99
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,180
Good luck in this lesson you added navigation menus to the scrolling home page web site.

100
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,010
We've been working on by using the appropriate relative you or else you were able to make the anchor

101
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,980
You set the site to use a single column layout for interior pages and then open to your local development

102
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,980
I'll reveal how I went about modifying the affinity theme to use their scrolling home page and anchor
