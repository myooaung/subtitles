A framework for Wordpress is a theme structure which can give extra functionality and different options

2
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.900
themes in a working WordPress website that inherit properties from a parent theme which is present in

3
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.050
Use this structure to allow their child themes to inherit more functionality and customisation options

4
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.840
than WordPress offers by default.

5
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.300
code within the child the files itself.

6
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970
the child theme doesn't get updated.

7
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.410
Only the parent theme let's start by checking out what WordPress says about child themes.

8
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.890
It's recommended that use a child theme because if you modify a theme directly and it's updated then

9
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
This is probably the biggest reason and the most important one to use a child.

10
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.360
Instead of updating or changing the parent theme or just a theme by itself it can speed up development

11
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.860
on the site and it's a great way to learn about WordPress theme development.

12
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.810
In this course you've delved pretty deeply already into how WordPress theme files work and how it connects

13
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.450
When we experiment with child themes in this video theme frameworks take this concept a step further

14
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.950
by providing a fixed parent theme and then allowing developers and developing themselves child themes

15
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.030
Let's look into how the Genesis framework works a little bit because this is what we'll be using to

16
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:18.780
If you go ahead and log in I want to show you the back and dashboard of your students inside of course

17
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.780
dotcom.

18
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.600
And if I just look under appearance's themes you'll see that I have a whole lot of themes available

19
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.910
can see that I have the Genesis theme in here but not activated.

20
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:50.360
And the theme that's activated right now is called the alt. pro theme which is a child theme for Genesis.

21
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.250
Now if I go ahead and write click and open visit the site in a new tab you can see that I'm actually

22
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.070
own design and my own content for my purposes here at W.P. of course dot com taking a look back inside

23
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.520
If I hit customize I'll be able to show you some of the custom functionality that Genesis child themes

24
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.180
First of all there's front page background images that the theme puts in here and I can actually change

25
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.900
seven different widget areas that you can populate with whatever you like.

26
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.640
That's my text widget which is number two right here.

27
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.100
widget which shows two columns right here.

28
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.620
When I have one of the things that many Genesys child themes provide is a front page layout which lets

29
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.790
Now back in our locally hosted live site we used that new affinity theme here and we were able to customize

30
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.600
But if we wanted to we should install a copy of this called a child theme so that we can place any of

31
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.410
that this is just version 1.0 of the affinity theme.

32
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:05.250
If I were to go into the editor or use my text or code editor called Adam to edit the stylesheet style

33
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.870
that I want or even any code snippets that I could find on the Internet as soon as this theme updates

34
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.180
it will erase all of my changes.

35
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.890
Now that is unless I have a child theme installed in the next video we're going to install a child theme

36
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.190
that wouldn't be ruined when the theme updates you can easily create a child theme for any standalone

37
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.920
theme that you have whether it's a premium theme or a free theme.

38
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:06.020
make nondestructive edits that wouldn't be overwritten if the child theme gets an update instead of

39
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.970
In this video I presented an introduction to child themes in wordpress and also how frameworks use the

40
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:29.130
the next video you'll create your own child theme for the new thety theme by Automattic and make some

41
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.840
Then when the developers update the theme to the next version none of it changes and customisations
