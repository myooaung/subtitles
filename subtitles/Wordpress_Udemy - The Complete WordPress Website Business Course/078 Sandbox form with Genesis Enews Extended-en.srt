1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,330
In this video you'll revisit one of your students sandbox sites at W.P. deaf course dot com and set

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,990
The Genesis framework again comes through with clean coding and beautiful styling for MailChimp forms

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,190
using the Genesis E-News extended plugin.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,750
The plugin is free in the repository but must be used with the premium Genesys framework.

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,110
up systems easy.

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,290
This time with an opt in form from MailChimp and the Genesis framework remember this website.

7
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,600
It's our original student's sandbox site made on the parallax pro theme from Genesis.

8
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,530
we replaced the lettering with a logo image up here at the left hand side.

9
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:05,610
Now let's add agenesis E-News extended plug in and a MailChimp for you remember how to get there.

10
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:12,630
Go back to I have this Resources page open still at students that WP of course dot com and I clicked

11
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,120
So this page opened up and I was able to log in using the Wordpress log in form.

12
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,110
Then I went up to my sites and opened the parallax pro-side dashboard.

13
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,180
Now over here in plugins I'm going to be looking for the Genesis E-News extended plugin.

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,780
I'll just click activate make sure that plugin is activated and now it gives me a widget under appearance

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,430
Now I also have the demo site open on the right hand side.

16
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,750
You can get there by going to demo dat studio press dot com slash parallax.

17
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:04,990
Then I went up an under sample opened page layouts and I'm looking at the content sidebar page layout

18
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:13,420
I'd like to put an E-News extended widget up here in the sidebar to show what are MailChimp form will

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:24,580
If you remember back in our parallax pro website that we made we go back to a sample page.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,050
Now here's a challenge for you.

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:39,280
Go back and tear parallax dashboard and change the default layout from a single column to a content

22
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,950
slash sidebar layout like the demo puzzle video now and give it a try.

23
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,120
Here's the way to do it.

24
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,460
Site wide.

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:57,240
I'll go up into Genesis and theme settings and if you scroll a little bit down there's a visual representation

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,950
down and hit save changes.

27
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,790
Now let's go back to our site tab and our sample page and refresh and see what we have.

28
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,580
this is the sample content that comes with the theme.

29
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,970
When you have an empty widget area.

30
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,240
So let's go back into the Wordpress dashboard and under appearance.

31
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,980
Let's open the customized.

32
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,200
Great now that that's open all open widgets.

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,430
Now why don't I have that primary sidebar widget that I'm looking for over here.

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,160
template.

35
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:53,160
So if I go into a sample page inside of the Web site here you can see that my widgets that I can customize

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,830
are different over here on the left hand side.

37
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,980
So now I have the primary sidebar widget here I can click Add a widget and go ahead and click the Genesis

38
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:09,960
E-News extended widget and we'll see what we can customize inside of this Genesys widget.

39
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,630
repository it does need the Genesis framework in the background to work.

40
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,430
And so let's see what customizations we can make even without grabbing any code from MailChimp yet let's

41
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,000
just make a title

42
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:42,570
sign up for our newsletter and you can place some text before the form and then some text after the

43
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,490
And the great thing about this is that this text is going to be styled to fit the fonts and headings

44
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,890
button or something like that but let's just leave it like that.

45
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,030
There's a Google slash feed burner ID.

46
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:15,130
If you're using these specific customisations for building your list you can use those IDs there.

47
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,870
But here's where the meat of it is.

48
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,190
It says not all services use hidden fields.

49
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,870
The Genesis E-News extended plug in is designed to work with any bulk mail or marketing email program.

50
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,830
It works really well with MailChimp and that's why we're using it right here.

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,090
It's just designed to work very well with Genesys child themes and you have a few more things you can

52
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,540
Or we can do is put some links in here just to see what will happen and what it will look like when

53
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,970
there's actually a link.

54
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,870
So if we have first name and email address you can see that it's already making the form look quite

55
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,630
And if we change that color site wide within the Genesis theme settings that will change in the form

56
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,500
as well.

57
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,580
So that's the benefit of using a plugin like this instead of just pasting the embed text from MailChimp

58
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,610
I'm going to change the button text to say join with an exclamation point.

59
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,200
And now I'm just going to go up and take out this after text and before text.

60
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:02,470
just a comfort message for the user that says if they join We're never going to share their email and

61
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,420
In fact that might even be better.

62
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,060
Cut and paste it into my button text instead because really why they're joining the list might be just

63
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,150
to get the download here.

64
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,830
So I go up here and take a look.

65
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,170
Let's just save and publish that for now.

66
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,630
Now of course this isn't an active forum because I don't have the proper code from MailChimp placed

67
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,520
Let's go back to MailChimp.

68
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,820
Now I'm still logged in under my list that I was working with in the last video.

69
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,990
So open MailChimp and log in and get to the sign up forms page and then the embedded forms place so

70
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,930
And it just the classic tab in embedded forms here.

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,850
I scroll down and as you remember we used this entire piece of code inside of our text widget to make

72
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,400
built in the last video and it looks just like the MailChimp form.

73
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,900
One thing to know is that you can't grab just a piece of this text you when you click in it it just

74
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,530
So I'm going to hit Control C and you know open up Notepad.

75
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,810
Just any text editor will do.

76
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,990
But I'm just going to paste that entire piece of code into my notepad document.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,850
Now if you look inside of the notepad document.

78
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,310
I've got like we had looked at before.

79
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:56,620
The styling is irrelevant to us and inside the MailChimp embed we're looking for the form action first.

80
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,700
the quotations.

81
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,660
It lasts all the way up until this end quote right here hit Control C and copy it.

82
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,190
Or of course you can right click and click copy.

83
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,050
code so I'll just hit right click and paste straight into there.

84
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,980
Now I need some special code for the email field and the first name field.

85
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:40,590
Again back in my notepad document I can see that the email field here we're looking for the name actually.

86
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,590
And so if you know in MailChimp that it's in all caps and it has a certain name for first name last

87
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,740
And again back to the notepad for first name.

88
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,800
It is all caps f name and I am just copying that straight into there.

89
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,160
And now there's no hidden fields inside of the code that MailChimp uses so we don't need to worry about

90
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,140
And really that will activate our entire form and save and publish.

91
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,080
And now this form will work for signing people up for that email list.

92
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,470
Let's go back to our sample page and hit refresh in our tab look at our lives say here.

93
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,630
Sign up for a newsletter that's

94
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,620
ahead and sign up for it.

95
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,030
Get the download now.

96
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,100
It opened up a tab that has a MailChimp sign up form right here and it tells me that there are errors.

97
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,070
Well I've already joined the list and this happens to you.

98
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,430
You can go back up to the top where you can manage subscribers and let's view subscribers and I'm just

99
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,300
going to remove remove myself from the list.

100
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,360
I'll just check my box right there and this is how I joined it yesterday.

101
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Clicked delete.

102
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,270
And of course you've got to confirm that you're going to do that you want to delete that subscriber.

103
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:26,430
OK now that that subscribers deleted I can erase this tab right here and go back into my web site and

104
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,230
let's sign up with that e-mail address again.

105
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,330
So it's sent me to the thank you page that we had set up before.

106
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,940
It's the same system and I'll get an e-mail I can confirm to join this list.

107
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,690
You can see that using the Genesis E-News extended plug in makes your forms really easy to use.

108
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,770
Now let's see what the Genesis E-News extended widget looks like in a different area of the Web site.

109
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,260
Suppose we wanted to have a sign up form in the footer area on every page of the Web site.

110
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,910
We go over here to footer one let's just see what it looks like to place a Genesis E-News extended widget

111
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,510
inside the footer.

112
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,340
OK we've got a blue area that matches our highlight color for the Web site and this footer area is going

113
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,020
So here's a challenge for you.

114
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:33,580
right code from your MailChimp account activating agenesis E-News extended form on the footer a video

115
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,820
now and give it a go.

116
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,020
That hopefully was super easy for you.

117
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,080
Genesis and MailChimp both make things very easy to do without having you know any programming.

118
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,350
Well now that I have the Genesis E-News extended widget inside the footer one widget area already I

119
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:02,900
which I am right now take that same code and since I already have it open I don't have to repaste it

120
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,600
but I've got it inside my notepad document here.

121
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,930
I mean to take that form action code control C for copy.

122
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,040
And now I'm going to place it in a form action field.

123
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:25,820
I know that the name of the email field in MailChimp is always e-mail all caps and name in all caps

124
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,470
When I leave the last name in the hidden fields empty.

125
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,840
And then Heeres get the download.

126
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:43,390
Oops I did that all the time.

127
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,480
There we go.

128
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:54,470
Look at that nice form that stretches the entire width and has a big nice call to action but button

129
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,420
And you can see that it styles the form differently depending on where it is on the website.

130
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:08,240
This is the really nice thing about using Genesys E-News extended for optin forms wherever you put it

131
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,110
So if we changed the theme from parallax to Cafe pro or to executive pro or any of the themes we've

132
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,410
what changes we make in the background.

133
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,080
One last thing to fix is just an empty form with no title or anything.

134
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:38,480
I go back up I could see that I was using sign up for our newsletter and your e-mail will never be shared

135
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,020
so I'm going to do that in the widget area.

136
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,240
And then this.

137
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,250
Your email will never be shared.

138
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:54,290
Message place in the text to show before the form and see what that looks like at the footer that looks

139
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:03,080
And we're all done that should be a working form that I can use to sign up with MailChimp in this lesson.

140
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,200
extended plugin using this plugin lets us separate the style or the look and feel of the form from the

141
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,420
This makes the forms look good and match the theme in the next video will wrap up the chapter by exploring

142
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,760
This will come in handy as we build an e-commerce store in the next chapter.
