00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.590
In this video you'll create some appropriate categories for the photography site so that visitors can

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.060
You'll also use your categories to provide an intuitive navigation scheme for the content side bar and

3
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.660
take a look at a category page which is one of the archive pages provided in wordpress categories or

4
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.930
We'll be learning how to use other taxonomies like tags and even custom taxonomies in this course.

5
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.420
The idea here is that we have a great section of the Web site called the content side bar right here

6
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.670
site and trying to look for different types of photos from this photographer at this point I'd like

7
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:10.540
the sidebar with those category names and then we'll go through and we'll assign several posts or at

8
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.970
Well here's how I would go through the process first under posts.

9
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.150
We used it at one point in an earlier video but you could see that we have a whole bunch of imported

10
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.990
But I'm going to go ahead and choose a few different category names that a photographer might use and

11
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200
enter him in here.

12
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.550
As before I've sped up the video to get through the process of creating each of these new categories

13
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.540
a little bit faster.

14
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.610
OK.

15
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.860
It's showing me my latest categories at the top so I can see that I've actually chosen figure actions

16
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.250
posts can be categorized in one category or more than one category.

17
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.530
And when somebody clicks that category name they'll be taken to what's called an archive page which

18
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.320
Now I'll just go over to appearance customize open the widget editor and I'll create a list of categories

19
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.960
inside of that content sidebar.

20
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.060
Now as you went through this process you may have noticed a couple of potential problems.

21
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.700
One is that if a category doesn't have any posts in it it doesn't actually show that category in the

22
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.670
All of these categories that came with our import are not ones that we really need.

23
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.240
So the first thing I would do is go through that categories list and delete all the categories that

24
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.010
And then I would add a post to each of those categories so that I could see what it will actually look

25
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:39.940
I'll start by closing the customize or and then going back under posts to the category page and what

26
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.240
I want to delete and there's actually 72 categories for pages of them.

27
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.450
And in fact I can go ahead and list all of those categories on the same page for bulk deleting if I

28
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.710
that's more than 72 and hit apply every screen within the Wordpress dashboard has a screen options dropdown

29
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.990
that you can use to control what you want to see or how many items you want to see on the screen.

30
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.840
What I'm going to do is click the checkbox next to names so that all of them are checked.

31
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.500
And then I'm going to go through and look for the categories that I want to keep Now one thing I want

32
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.090
called photographs and I do want to keep that one because I think every post that has a photograph in

33
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.200
So there's photographs I want to keep that on

34
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.530
still life

35
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.790
great.

36
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.060
So a click book actions to lead.

37
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.160
Now this just deletes the categories.

38
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.710
It doesn't delete the posts within the category.

39
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.080
If a post is left without a category it will be set to the category Uncategorized which is actually

40
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.850
Within WordPress There we go one two three four five six categories.

41
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.510
Oops it looks like I deleted one of the categories that I had created before.

42
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.540
It must have been right near the top because it starts with a.

43
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.840
I missed it before but it's called Action.

44
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.650
A lot of times when you type into a field and you need to remember something that you typed before the

45
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.650
So I'll add that category back in now that I have these categories.

46
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.240
There's zero posts in most of the categories.

47
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.570
There are three posts in the photographs category because I had created those posts and placed them

48
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.990
But what I do now is go through two posts and I'll start to assign some posts to certain categories.

49
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.220
I can use the quick edit method for getting these into some of my categories.

50
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.560
And really it doesn't matter which ones I choose.

51
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:42.950
of course when I set this content up with my client I will have them be putting in photographs and making

52
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.930
Now because I know that each of my photograph posts will have a featured image I'm going to go ahead

53
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.760
place a featured image within each of those after I've chosen categories for all of them.

54
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:28.220
Oops don't forget I want to put this not only into the photographs but also the particular type of category

55
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.910
photographs.

56
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.330
Hello world.

57
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.950
This one needs to get him out of it Uncategorized and be put into photographs.

58
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:52.250
I'm just going through and setting up this category schemes that I can see what my design will look

59
00:07:53.450 --> 00:08:01.530
Once I have categorized posts with featured images just one more task I'm going to place a featured

60
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:15.420
top and the three posts coming down right here on the front page having featured images and I'll also

61
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:25.600
So applause the video while I take care of that as I finish up the last post here.

62
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.930
I just want to show you that I've placed a featured image within each of the three posts and for this

63
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.590
on the home page or the archive page there.

64
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.400
I also want to let you know that I went in and I'm going to go ahead and change this featured image

65
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.960
to the one that I edited.

66
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.920
And we as we had in previous videos.

67
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.750
Great now that that post is saved we might be able to just go back to the home page and refresh the

68
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.770
Nice.

69
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.990
We've got three feature posts here.

70
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.080
Nice.

71
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:35.930
I go back up and click one of the sidebar photo categories buttons you can see that shows a title category

72
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.900
And that's the photo I had under the action category.

73
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:53.420
I can also see that the R L has the R L we're using slash category slash action and that u r l the name

74
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.990
category or something different depending on the client.

75
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:11.150
If you go back to the Wordpress dashboard and under settings permalink you were controlling that you

76
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.090
a little bit lower down are the optional changes the category based and the tag base.

77
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:31.040
There's an explanation here but if for instance you use topic instead of category it will place topics

78
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.650
in that you are all here at the top.

79
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.200
One last thing about the category taxonomy.

80
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:45.950
Some themes will display not only a title on a category page or an archive page but also a description.

81
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.300
And 2014 is one of those.

82
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:57.280
If you go back to the Wordpress dashboard under posts categories and then you open up one of your category

83
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.600
pages by say action edit.

84
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.450
You'll be able to put in a description.

85
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:13.230
Now this description isn't used on every theme but some themes do use it for a photographer site.

86
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.400
It's a nice addition.

87
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.060
You'll learn about categories and created some category navigation by placing a widget on the content

88
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:35.560
You learn that categories are one of Wordpress is taxonomies or types of content and that archive pages

89
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.410
are those that display a list of certain types of content.

90
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.240
In this case the category archive displays a list of posts within a certain category.

91
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.100
editing section of the Wordpress dashboard in the next video.

92
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:02.860
We'll go over another included taxonomy called tags and compare it to categories and you'll create another

93
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.310
Let's get to it.
