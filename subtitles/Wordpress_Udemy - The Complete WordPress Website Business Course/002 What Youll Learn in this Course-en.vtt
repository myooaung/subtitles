00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.790
Since there are a lot of different moving parts and systems that need to work together creating a complete

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.150
You'll learn how to implement all the moving parts into a working whole without having to program or

3
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.690
The phrase Web developer has a wide range of meanings but in this course you'll learn how to be an expert

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.140
WordPress implementer making functional custom web sites using the tools presented here and you'll be

5
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.290
By the end of this video you'll have an understanding of all the systems that work together to deliver

6
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.100
You'll have an example of any kind of web site imaginable and be ready to venture off on your own to

7
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.140
You need these three main things the Wordpress files a server to host them and a database.

8
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.060
The files are built into programming languages DHP and Javascript.

9
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.180
The server reads these files incorporates data from the database and delivers web pages to a browser

10
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:31.060
HDMI L and C Ss as a WordPress implementor you don't need to know much about these programming languages

11
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.880
but you do need to know how the systems work together will be setting up development environments that

12
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.860
These can be on your local computer or at a hosting company ready to deliver your websites to the world.

13
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.240
First self-contained.

14
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.010
It's a server just like hosting companies use but it's freely available to use on your local computer

15
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.810
to develop web sites without being connected to the Internet.

16
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.110
Map stands for my apache My sequel THP.

17
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.710
Apache is an open source web server that's used by many hosting companies.

18
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.960
It's enabled to use Add-Ons like my sequel databases and HP on which Wordpress is built.

19
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.160
Installing map on your local computer means that you can build and test web sites without needing to

20
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.040
If I started the server by clicking here you'll see the Apache server light up as well as my sequel

21
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.810
Once I have these running in the background I can navigate to a predefined address at the server through

22
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.130
any browser and open my WordPress website.

23
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.000
Take a look at the address bar.

24
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.860
I'm not on the internet.

25
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.240
I'm just navigating to the server on my local computer through map.

26
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.920
I can log into the Wordpress dashboard here by opening up the log in page in another tab and using the

27
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.440
Now if I change something on the site using the Wordpress dashboard I can save my changes and open the

28
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.630
I'll just open.

29
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.840
Hello world.

30
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:47.980
I'll type local for web site enabled and click update.

31
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.770
Now once I get the update post has been updated message I can navigate back to my Web site tab and refresh

32
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.900
Wordpress is communicating with the server using Apache and connecting to the database in the background

33
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.050
and then delivering the Web site pages to my browser.

34
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.810
All through my local map server environment.

35
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:22.130
Now if I open windows explorer I can show you the files that the server is using to surf the Web site

36
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.870
Here's the word press corps file structure and if I use the map interface inside my browser I can show

37
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.200
Let's go to man and if I click Open start page inside my browser.

38
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.370
It will open a map page that's again hosted locally on my computer and under my sequel I can click THP

39
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.240
my admin by using this utility built into the server called P-H PMI admin.

40
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.720
I can show you the database tables and here's where I made that change just now.

41
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:12.820
Under the local for database I can go to W.P. posts and all the tables under there are right here and

42
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.140
Local For web site enabled WordPress.

43
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.620
Though it started as a blogging platform has grown into a content management system or a CMOS.

44
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.240
A blog is just a Web site that's set up to deliver periodic posts and display them in reverse chronological

45
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.490
order because so many features and functions have been added to the Wordpress platform.

46
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.400
It's become the most popular CIMS in the world.

47
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.580
Powering more than 25 percent of all the Web sites on the Internet it's the convenience of managing

48
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.700
themes and plug ins for Wordpress that has let it to become so ubiquitous it's structure keeping the

49
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.180
through themes and functionality through plug ins allows WordPress websites to be easily managed by

50
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.080
My clients appreciate that I can give them the keys to their website so to speak and allow them to make

51
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.090
If we go back to the Wordpress dashboard I'll show you how you can manage and customize WordPress Web

52
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.520
development without having to program or code anything from scratch.

53
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.860
After they're installed into WordPress you can see that I have a few themes here and I can enable a

54
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.050
different theme to completely change the look of my web site.

55
00:06:52.210 --> 00:07:01.190
Without changing the content it all take a look at the difference same Web site different look and feel

56
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:09.060
if I go back to Windows Explorer I can show you where the theme files are located in the WP content

57
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.660
enabled the 2014 theme.

58
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.560
The theme I had enabled before was called 2016.

59
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.130
These are some of the default themes that come with wordpress.

60
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.520
If I go back to W.P. content you can see that there's also a plug ins folder here.

61
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.200
And yes you guessed it that's where the plugin files are located.

62
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.490
While themes control the look and feel of a Web site built with wordpress plugins are used to control

63
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:52.460
For example here's a contact form plug in and I can show you where it's managed within the Wordpress

64
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.540
Back at the dashboard here's the plug in Section.

65
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.030
You can see the corresponding contact form plug in here.

66
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.170
The plug in provides a settings panel within the Wordpress dashboard located here.

67
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.560
And if I open that up I can manage my contact forms.

68
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.200
I want to get a functional contact form to appear on the Web site.

69
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:30.100
When someone fills out the form the plug in and wordpress combine forces to send me an email with the

70
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:45.530
Back in wordpress under pages you can see I've created a page in wordpress It's called contact me and

71
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.650
Here's where I've pasted it from the contact form plugin.

72
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:59.760
If I open the web site in my browser and I browse to this contact me page you can see the page I created

73
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.970
Now since this website is being developed locally I'd have to have another add on for Apache server

74
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.580
to be able to test the email delivery here.

75
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:18.060
WordPress has a robust transactional email delivery system that controls things like contact form emails

76
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.910
sending email to new users with their log in information and the forgotten password system so users

77
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.300
to accomplish the things I just mentioned.

78
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:39.060
There are other systems that will get into later to like domain name configuration client billing and

79
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.080
For now take note that we are using a web site address on our local server just for development purposes.

80
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:53.160
When you set up Web sites for clients you'll need to connect their domain names like exampled dot com

81
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.850
to their Web site.

82
00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:00.690
We do this by pointing the domain through the domain registrar like go daddy dot com or another service

83
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.370
to the web server.

84
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.460
When we set up a live internet server at a hosting company we'll explore how to do this.

85
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.720
As you build more than 10 Web sites in this course you'll learn to connect the systems together to create

86
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.460
needs in the future.

87
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.090
To wrap it up in this video I've discussed how Wordpress is a content management system that contains

88
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.670
The main systems working together are pretty simple.

89
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:37.700
However a server with the ability to deliver web pages using both a file system and a database.

90
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.050
Will look at all the specific files in the word press corps file structure set up all your developer

91
00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:00.710
Then we'll get started with business tools like invoicing using a spreadsheet template how to take one

92
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.120
To stay on top of trends see their
