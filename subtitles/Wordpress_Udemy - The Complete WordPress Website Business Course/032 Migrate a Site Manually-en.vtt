00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.480
In the last video you created a complete copy of a WordPress site at a different server location and

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.220
It was easy but what was really going on by migrating the site manually you'll do all the steps yourself

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.780
and through the process learn all the steps and how they work together.

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.040
By the end of this video you'll understand the process of migrating a WordPress site and you'll be able

5
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.570
Let's get going.

6
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.920
Start by making sure that you're logged into your brochure dash site WordPress installation locally

7
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.760
using map and click Open start page so that you can open this map start page and be able to access the

8
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.170
go to the see panel and down here under databases you can access it through DHP.

9
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.460
My admin what we're going to be doing is moving the fire weed photography site that we made in the last

10
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.630
This time we're not going to be using the plugin but we're going to be doing it manually instead of

11
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.120
We're going to be copying all the files from the original brochure site you are ill and file structure

12
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.140
including the database.

13
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.470
So the first thing I'm going to do is open up windows explorer and I've got the same window open on

14
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.460
The first thing I've already done is created a folder using this new folder button inside my map HD

15
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.240
Now it's empty at this point but what I'm going to do is take the entire file structure from brochure

16
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.070
So I'll pause the video while that's copying for ground users will use the file manager to do this migration

17
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.100
of files ourselves.

18
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.240
So when the file manager.

19
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.460
I know I have the files for this site within the brochure site folder.

20
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.430
I'm going to go back up one level and create a new folder.

21
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.640
I'm going to call this one manual migration and now that I have that folder there I need to capture

22
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.150
all the files from brochure Dasch site.

23
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.860
I just held shift down and I'm going to compress them into a zip file so it will be easy to download

24
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.050
and then upload into the next folder.

25
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.990
So now that that's created my zip file I can reload the page to take a look for it.

26
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.710
But I'll take this file and then I'll double click it to download it to my computer.

27
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.480
Great now that's downloaded it's in my downloads folder on my computer.

28
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.920
I could go up one level again and go into manual migration and since this directory is empty I know

29
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.500
Here it is that will give me a message at the bottom right when it's done uploading.

30
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.640
Now that that says 8 megabytes complete I can just click go back and it will close that tab.

31
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.700
And I've got my zip file there.

32
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.510
There we go.

33
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.660
Now I can reload the page and I got all my files there again.

34
00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.920
I can delete this zip file since it made a copy and unzipped the files into the same directory

35
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.980
back in Windows Explorer.

36
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.510
The files have downloaded into the map folder.

37
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.860
There it is now that I have an exact copy of the file structure that brochure say is using over in my

38
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:28.080
I'm going to create a new database and then make a copy of the database that this site uses inside that

39
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.240
So I'll go back into Firefox and open the map start page and I get a quick Ph.

40
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.430
My admin is managing the databases that are being used within my sequel.

41
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.400
That map is using on the server on my local machine and when that opens.

42
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.840
I'm going to call it manual migration

43
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.990
now if you recall when we make a fresh WordPress installation we use the Wordpress installation script

44
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.890
in order for it to connect to the database and then populate the actual database tables and rows.

45
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.120
Now this is an empty database in the same way that we've done it before but what we're going to do is

46
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.350
export all the database tables from the brochure dash site database and then we're going to import them

47
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.950
into the manual migration thereby creating an exact copy of the database.

48
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.870
So within HP my admin click brochure site and you can make sure that the databases brochure site up

49
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.450
all we do is keep the default settings and click go.

50
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.550
And that will prompt our browser to save a file and I'll just click OK.

51
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.420
Great that's in my downloads folder.

52
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.620
Now all I have to do is click the manual migration database.

53
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.920
Now I can tell that it's the database that I'm in is manual migration and I'll click the import tab

54
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.950
leave everything as the default again click Browse and go ahead and go into my downloads folder.

55
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.240
Find that brochure site.

56
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:36.150
Dot Cuil file and select it hit open and I can go to the bottom and click go.

57
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.680
There we go.

58
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:46.060
And it says import has been successfully finished 96 queries executed and we can go ahead and look at

59
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.130
I click manual migration or hit the structure tab.

60
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.540
You can see that all those tables are within it and there we go.

61
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.900
There's a couple of more steps to edit.

62
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:04.720
And if you're in the database under manual migration Now let's look at W.P. options.

63
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.840
You can see that the old U R L is in here under site you are Apple and home.

64
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.750
And we want to change that to the new manual migration.

65
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.290
You are a

66
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.320
there is one and there's two ground.

67
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:35.240
We'll create a new database slightly differently go down to my sequel databases and then we're going

68
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.810
So I'll call this one manual and I've got to remember that the database name is Greg.

69
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:53.660
The 11 underscore manual that I need to create a user that's sure enough I can call it the same thing

70
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.960
and choose a password

71
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:13.120
to create that user with the user name and password that again I need to remember

72
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:23.440
that I need to give that user access to its database

73
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.430
when to give that user all privileges.

74
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.120
And it's been updated so I can go back now.

75
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.080
I'll just quickly write down all the information that I just entered so I don't forget it.

76
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:45.930
Now I can go back to the see Pernell home and go back down to the databases section to open THP.

77
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:56.350
My admin Now if I look under grade 11 I can see my different databases here and if I click manual you

78
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:07.610
Just like when working locally with map I just have to go into the brochure database and export the

79
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:26.090
and then I can close that go into the manual which is empty and import that same file.

80
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.590
Click manual on the left here to look at the tables and go into the options just like when working in

81
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:48.070
on both site Eurail and home rose.

82
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:56.750
Now there's one more change we need to make to make our new RL work in a new tab up here and be a duplicate

83
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:03.250
of this old Tab brochure site and that is to edit the WP config file.

84
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:11.020
I'm going to go into Windows Explorer again and in my manual migration remember we made an exact copy

85
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:26.260
So I'm going to go ahead and open Adam the code editor and navigate to this manual migration set of

86
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.440
I'll have file in Adam and add a new project folder.

87
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.990
I'm going to find it within H.T. docs and manual migration

88
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.550
great.

89
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.920
this one is in manual migration great.

90
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.710
Now instead of brochure site this one is going to the new database name

91
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:15.850
and the user name the password and the host should be all the same I click control as to save and now

92
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.530
that should be the last step.

93
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:25.300
If I type localhost slash my uro

94
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.190
if everything's connected correctly I should get an exact copy of the site.

95
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.690
Nice.

96
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.200
Looks like everything is working well.

97
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.570
I'll open a new tab and make sure I can log in to the WP admin area

98
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:57.950
and I've created an exact copy so my username and password will be the same as that user and password

99
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.620
You are is correct.

100
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.200
I'm logged in.

101
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.550
Everything seems to be working.

102
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.600
And to edit the WP config file if you're on safe ground.

103
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:19.370
The easiest way is to go to the file manager and use that code editor on W.P. config.

104
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.390
of a brochure site.

105
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.970
So I clicked code editor and edit and I'll put my new credentials in down here.

106
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.740
Click Save and I can close this window.

107
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.960
I should be able to navigate to the new site in the same way as locally.

108
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:58.430
As I mentioned in the last video this time the home button has not been changed.

109
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.940
So there's one more change we need to make within the Wordpress interface and that is to edit this menu

110
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:12.700
I'm just going to go ahead and edit the menu and change that custom You rail to the new home page.

111
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.190
And I'll hit save menu.

112
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.760
And that should fix it.

113
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.070
Let's see.

114
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:26.660
Nice.

115
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.150
You are l.

116
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:37.220
All the other links that we've populated this site with our relative links and so there are pages or

117
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.680
to the New York and stayed correct.

118
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.750
You can run a simple check within the database to see if any of the you URLs are the wrong one after

119
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:06.280
If you're inside the manual migration database go to the search tab and I might search for the exact

120
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:24.930
brochure site and then select all the tables and hit go zero matches.

121
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:32.300
So I know that in the whole database there's nothing that says the old you are all if you do happen

122
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:47.310
I'll open the search window again and show you the links that come up that contain manual dash migration.

123
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.290
For example if you do come up with.

124
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.410
Looks like there's two matches NWP options one match in posts matter.

125
00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:02.690
If you get the old link coming up you could say browse and that'll open up those rows in the same window

126
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.210
and you can go ahead and edit them right here.

127
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:11.810
If you have a lot of search and replace or a lot of database tables to change that you could run a search

128
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.030
and replace function.

129
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.580
There's a great search and replace plug in here with more than 100000 active installs and this one looks

130
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:30.510
Better search replace this will be convenient to use in the case that you're migrating a site to a different

131
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:40.140
L perhaps and it has a lot of posts or a lot of pages that contain references to the old site name.

132
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.110
Nice job.

133
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:47.400
In this video you made a complete copy of a Web site and moved it to a new location without installing

134
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:56.490
You made the appropriate edits to the database and the WP config file to make everything work together.

135
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.280
In the next video we'll look at some of the differences in how hosting companies work with the files

136
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.970
hosting companies provide migration services as a part of their business.
