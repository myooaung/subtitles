00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,930
In this video you'll learn how to manage multiple WordPress websites and sell your services to clients

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,930
Security releases monitoring and reporting for more than 50 different Web sites and we'll explore how

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,770
By the end of this lesson you'll have the tools proposal templates and knowledge you need to set up

4
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,730
Let's check it out.

5
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:42,410
Let's start by just going back to W.P. elevation dotcom that I had mentioned in the last video and I'll

6
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,050
Troy Dean and Christina Romero at the BP elevation offer a lot of free information.

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,050
If you just join their mailing list and get on the waiting list for their courses and their membership

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,440
If you click the Join button at the top right you'll see a pop up come up at this time.

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,200
It says it's currently closed and will reopen for new students shortly.

10
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,510
an amazing webinar.

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,760
We learn exactly how to manage Web site care plans for your clients.

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,360
Very very excellent.

13
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:34,970
If you also look in the blog if you click blog up at the top here you can go ahead and go down and enjoy

14
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:42,710
some different pieces of information where there's so much good stuff there that I've come in searched

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,820
on Google for a few of the articles that I know have provided great value to me.

16
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:56,470
I searched for W.P. elevation Web site care plans in Google and I came up with this one as the top result.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,210
It's from April of 2015.

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,590
And let's just go over some of the information that Troy presents in this article.

19
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,340
Now this is a very long blog post.

20
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:16,560
It's actually a very thorough article that I would read from start to finish if I were you and actually

21
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,490
Web site care plans and Web site maintenance plans work.

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,160
This is some intro text and some little proof of some income that his clients have made but with wordpress

23
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,490
maintenance plans I really subscribe to the idea that Troy has here of calling them WordPress care plans

24
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,770
rather than maintenance plans because maintenance has these kind of stations with auto maintenance or

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,680
People don't really want to subscribe to maintenance plans but care plans.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,330
It's a positive image and people are really excited because they don't want to have to go in and fix

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,790
They want to have somebody in the back end taking care of it day to day.

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,720
And as we scroll down you can see that he has an excellent section here about what to include in your

29
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,280
website care plans.

30
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,740
And let's go over some of these in detail that first and maybe the most obvious thing that you should

31
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,320
updates or updates of Wordpress come out and wordpress does security updates which are minor and usually

32
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,180
non-breaking updates automatically.

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,850
WordPress does provide this as a part of the core service but then Major WordPress updates are manual.

34
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,890
When word press releases a new version and you can decide whether you want to allow your host to do

35
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,980
here plugins and themes.

36
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,500
Also update periodically and when WordPress updates its a really good idea to check that the plug ins

37
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,950
and the themes that their Web site is using have broken or been made degraded after the updates.

38
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,810
And this is one of the pictures that you paint for your client that you're going to be going in and

39
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,930
updating WordPress for security and for increased features and speed and at the same time you're going

40
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
It's a kind of monitoring of the Web site on an ongoing basis.

41
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,480
That's really worth something.

42
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,020
And it has a lot of value to clients.

43
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,890
Backups should also be a big part of a Web site care plan.

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,410
You can backup data daily and you can do weekly backups of the entire website so that if anything happens

45
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:03,730
or if God forbid the client goes in and breaks the website you can always back out to a previous version

46
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,800
and restore it very easily.

47
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,800
up their web site in an external location like Dropbox or Amazon S3 in addition to backing it up on

48
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,680
And you can get reports of hacking attempts that come in at your server and you can pass that information

49
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,440
along to your clients on a weekly or a monthly basis so that they know that you're protecting their

50
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:48,940
website on an ongoing basis and then uptime monitoring is another great way to offer value to your clients

51
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,980
so that they don't have to be checking their website every week or every day to make sure that it's

52
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,830
up you can assure them that you're going to be getting a notification in the case that their Web site

53
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,100
Now there are a lot more tips and tricks in this article.

54
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,400
Premium services that you can offer for even more money.

55
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,430
A list of tools that Troy and Krystina recommend which are a lot of the ones that I use and I'll show

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:29,260
And you should just read this whole article completely to get everything that you can out of it.

57
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,120
Here's the play button for a replay of this or it's 115 minutes long.

58
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,580
There's also an e-mail a link to it.

59
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:55,690
The e-mail text that Troy Dean uses to send to his clients to introduce the idea of web site care plans

60
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,380
to them and what value they bring.

61
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:05,620
It's really the same way that I got started by reading this and asking my clients if they'd like to

62
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,060
And many did right away seeing the value of me watching their Web site from behind the scenes on a consistent

63
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,110
So go ahead and read this article.

64
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,670
And let's go on to the next step.

65
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,950
There's a couple more great blog posts in W.P. elevation com.

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,710
Here's one by Christina Romero about transitioning clients into using Web site care plans and recurring

67
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,860
Again an excellent excellent blog post that gives you a lot of good information about the steps to take

68
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,670
to get existing clients to buy into a care plan.

69
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,720
So a couple of steps you create a sales page on your website that tells and paints the value of those

70
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,900
Check out that has automatic subscriptions which is very easy to set up.

71
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:04,480
Write a blog post that you can then talk about and point your clients towards to read more in more detail.

72
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,640
What web site care plans entail.

73
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,700
Draft an email that I just showed the link to back here that you can send to your current clients and

74
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:19,540
send that email from a marketing system so that you can track who opens it and who doesn't open it so

75
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,240
So the people that open and clicked the link in the initial email even if they didn't get right back

76
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,670
It's an excellent process to go through if you already have some clients that you're taking care of

77
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,230
site maintenance.

78
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,580
Here's a good little section in number 2 in this blog post.

79
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,810
Get a process that talks about when you have a Web site care airplane your taking care of someone's

80
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,060
Do it efficiently so you don't take too much time on each website.

81
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:10,490
I have either hosting plans or web site care plans on almost 50 different client websites and I have

82
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,540
their Web site and I send them a monthly report telling them everything I've done for them in the month

83
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,150
so that they can feel good about paying me that recurring fee.

84
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:35,370
Let's jump into the tools that I use and take a look at the backend of my hosting program at site ground.

85
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,250
Now it looks a little different than your sample site Ground account that you sign up for yourself because

86
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,020
in a virtual private server.

87
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,510
It gives me this W H M which is a web host manager program on the backend where I can go over and list

88
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,600
If I just click all you can see that I'm showing 46 different Web sites that I'm actively managing here

89
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,400
and each one has its own control panel.

90
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,730
You can see that I can switch in the see panel through between all the different sites that I manage

91
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:27,300
and if I look at this account the panel for this client I can go down here and just want to show you

92
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,220
One of the things that I like to do is set up W.P. auto update but I like it to update the Wordpress

93
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,860
But I do like to turn off the plugin updating.

94
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,390
I want to update plugins and themes manually myself so that I can make sure and check on them.

95
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,550
Now I do have the automatic WordPress version enabled and I do have actually upgrade plugins checked

96
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,120
that I like to keep.

97
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:15,880
Now if I go back to the see panel homepage again near the bottom there's also the staging service.

98
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,510
Now on the startup plan that you have with your free trial staging is not enabled you have to get at

99
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:36,720
If I wanted to just create a staging copy here I could just hit continue and choose a username and password

100
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,880
updates.

101
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,830
I can test everything out make sure it's working and then with one click I can overwrite the old site

102
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,610
and take all my changes.

103
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,420
that I offer in my website.

104
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,900
You can see this is their home page and you can use a lot of the services for free.

105
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,890
So if I just log in here I want to show you the back end of my account at managed W.P. dotcom where

106
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,320
There's a free plug in that managed W.P. provides called the worker plug in and you place that and activate

107
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,150
basis are listed here.

108
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,580
I can get them in a grid pattern or in a list like this and I can see on each one what the version of

109
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:54,100
Wordpress is and if I look at the overview I can see a lot of different stats about what needs updating

110
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,490
and the overhead I might be using where I could get rid of some stuff and make my site faster.

111
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:14,270
I can optimize websites in that way if I wanted to go through and use managed W.P. to update plugins

112
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,910
for example throughout all of my sites I could go here and see which of these plugins I want to manage

113
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:30,150
and I could do them on all 30 or 50 sites that manage WP is managing for me.

114
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:37,370
I don't often update all sites at the same time and so often use this Web site's tab over here.

115
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,410
for updates.

116
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,790
I can just click update.

117
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,810
All right here.

118
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,920
And then I can go and make sure that everything's working now we've learned how to manage backups with

119
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:15,210
and an up time monitor as well as monitoring SEO and Web site rankings along with Google Analytics.

120
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,120
If you have it installed it's worth upgrading to the premium services especially if you're charging

121
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:33,950
It's very worth that much money for the value you bring to do all these services for your website clients.

122
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,780
Mine start at $150 a month and go up to $300 a month for my web site care plans.

123
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:48,150
In this video we've gone through a few different articles at W.P. elevation dot com found a resource

124
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,380
W.P. elevation in order to invite your clients in a really valuable way to subscribe to your Web site

125
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,420
I also showed you around my back end of my hosting program at site ground where I manage some of my

126
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,280
gives you a great place to see all of the stats of plugins themes and wordpress updates all in one place.

127
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,920
In addition to offering backups and uptime monitoring as well in this video you learn of a number of

128
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,000
by setting up your clients to value what you have to offer and showing what you do to support their

129
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,000
consistent.
