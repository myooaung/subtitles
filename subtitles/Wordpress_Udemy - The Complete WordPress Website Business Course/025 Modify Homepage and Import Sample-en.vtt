00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.690
WordPress keeps the web site content in a database separate from the theme and core files.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.560
Were able to change the layout but keep the same content in this lesson you'll import a sample set of

3
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.500
theme would look.

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.310
Using the same content you'll be importing the standard sample content provided for Wordpress theme

5
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.020
This list you see every kind of test and image formatting possible as you build a web site.

6
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.290
Let's get started in this chapter.

7
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.470
We're going to be modifying the last site that we made under the old brochure site inside of our local

8
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.500
So if you don't have it open already.

9
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.770
Get the server running and go ahead and log into your Wordpress dashboard at your brochure site.

10
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.180
If you remember.

11
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:12.010
and placed a photo and some content as well as modifying the navigation Hetter the sidebar and the footer

12
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.890
The first thing we're going to do is import some sample content so that we can see what the site will

13
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.930
As we have multiple blog posts coming up on the home page.

14
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.040
So if you navigate to WordPress dot org.

15
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.230
What I usually do is search for sample SML.

16
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.360
It's an XML file that will be looking for to import into Wordpress and it'll show us many different

17
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.900
In fact every single layout option that a WordPress site might have so that we can test what a theme

18
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.990
It's got a theme.

19
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.530
This comes from the Wordpress Kodak's under support and here it is right here.

20
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.450
It's from Automattic the company behind Wordpress and its the theme unit test data.

21
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.120
SML.

22
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.700
If you click the link it might just open all of the SML document into your browser.

23
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.540
So what you might want to do is right click and then save link as and that will go ahead and download

24
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.240
Unit Test Data dot X will insets finished downloading.

25
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.300
I can't open the downloads folder in Windows Explorer and then I can drag that over to my wordpress

26
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.740
Looks like I've already got it there so just make sure I have the latest one.

27
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.090
Now I'll go back into the dashboard and if you go under Tools import there's a number of importer's

28
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.290
And we're going to download the Wordpress importer.

29
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.750
These are all different import or plug ins and if you just click WordPress it'll prompt you to download

30
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.460
the Wordpress importer plugin

31
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.690
install.

32
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.530
You can click activate plug in and run in Puerto

33
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.270
and then browse to your computer where you saved the xml file.

34
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.310
Upload file and import if you like.

35
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:51.400
You can just import these authors or you can attach or assign the posts to an existing user.

36
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.940
If I want to explore how different authors would look inside the site I might just go ahead and leave

37
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.810
And I do want to click download an import file attachments.

38
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.790
There we go.

39
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.120
If you click Have fun it'll bring you straight back to the dashboard.

40
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.640
Now we can see in the activity that there is some more published posts there's some comments in here.

41
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.340
Let's go ahead and look at posts all posts.

42
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.890
You can see that not just hello world but there's a whole bunch of posters actually 41 items in my posts.

43
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:44.090
And in terms of pages I've got 22 pages they're marked so that we can see what they look like and what

44
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.640
And let's look at the users.

45
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.530
it's imported these users.

46
00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.920
Now these users are subscribers instead of administrators and it shows you how many posts each one of

47
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.660
As the administrator I'll be able to access all of the posts even if they're authored by these fictitious

48
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.460
users.

49
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:22.740
And let's take a look at the media library and make sure that we've imported all the media great.

50
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.610
For example some of the images are labeled with their size and you can also see

51
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.280
which page or post each of these image is attached to.

52
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.370
So let's change the home page of our site to instead of being just a single page.

53
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.710
Let's have it be a list of posts in reverse order with the newest one at the top.

54
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.130
Go to the Wordpress dashboard and under settings reading

55
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.050
instead of displaying a static page the front page displays your latest posts.

56
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.430
Settings saved.

57
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.280
we'll see a featured post which is sticky which means that post sticks to the top.

58
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.260
There's our latest hello world page that was formed as a default post when we installed WordPress.

59
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.340
That's a long post.

60
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.140
Here's another one.

61
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.970
One of the things we can do to trim down each of those lengthy pages is to show instead of 10 posts

62
00:06:52.260 --> 00:07:04.410
Let's go ahead and show three we can also if I go back to the home page itself on the first page of

63
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.790
I'll just use the convenient edit button here.

64
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:25.510
And after a small section of the post what I'll do is insert a read more tag.

65
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:32.560
That way when this post is being displayed on an archive page or on a list of posts page like the home

66
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.460
Let's take a look.

67
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.590
Here's the sticky posts.

68
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.430
And great.

69
00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.040
Instead of the lengthy post I've got a continue reading button where I can click that to open up the

70
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:10.690
Now that we have a revised layout with blog posts on the home page instead of a single page you can

71
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.040
XML document.

72
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:27.390
But let's go ahead and look at what a different theme would look like with the same content.

73
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.800
So under appearance theme's

74
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:41.740
you can see that we have 20:16 active 2015 and 2014 is an interesting theme that's designed as kind

75
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:53.030
If we click live preview it will open the customized and show us what our existing content will look

76
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.680
It is nice you can see the typographic is totally different.

77
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:13.540
Here's a widget on the side that came from our original footer widget and then if I scroll to the very

78
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.590
When you change themes sometimes the widget locations change a little bit.

79
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:32.770
So what's called the footer widget area here in 2014 contains my Google map plug in map and in the content

80
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:44.240
sidebar that's where the find me widget is up here in the content side bar and the primary side bar

81
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.890
looks like it has the search window and the pages widget that we had placed before well I'm just looking

82
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:06.440
In this video you imported a theme testing document into your Wordpress installation and modify the

83
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.530
homepage to list posts instead of a single page.

84
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:17.440
You also previewed the 2014 theme without actually activating it in the next video.

85
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.660
You'll activate 2014 revise the widgets to match the theme and add a featured posts area to the home
