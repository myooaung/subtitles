00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.670
In this video you'll test your new MailChimp opt in form and edit the auto response emails that MailChimp

2
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.900
with client logos and information to personalize the experience for users by the end of this video you'll

3
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.740
systems set up using the form that you created in the last video.

4
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.410
We're going to customize it for different items to e-mails and two Thank you pages provided by MailChimp.

5
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.640
Let's take a look in the MailChimp area under sign up forms we click general forms there.

6
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.000
You'll remember that we went into this dropdown right here and we found four different items that we

7
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.920
Remember that the first one is actually a fifth one the Sign-Up form is something we can obviously customize.

8
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.090
But the four things we're going to customize in this video are the sign up thank you page.

9
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:15.460
The OPT in confirmation e-mail the confirmation thank you page and the final welcome email what I'd

10
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.890
like you to do right now is go back to your sample site in wordpress where you set up the MailChimp

11
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.820
in your browser and opening the two e-mails that you receive while going through the process.

12
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.080
Pause the video now and get those items open how that go for you.

13
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.530
We are able to get yourself confirmed and join in on your subscription list.

14
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.640
Well here's what I did.

15
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.990
and it might be a new window depending on how you have your browser set up.

16
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
But this tab said almost finished.

17
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.660
to confirm your email address.

18
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.490
So after you click in your email and this is where I had customized my thank you page here.

19
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.630
This is my opt in thank you page.

20
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.910
We'll redirect YouTube page where you can download your PDA mind math.

21
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:30.150
That's an example of an ethical bribe or a lead magnet you might call it or something that is a reward

22
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.100
for joining your email list.

23
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.520
They're going to want to get something which is a download and it helps to get more sign ups when you

24
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.020
But you don't want to give them a link to the download in this first thank you page.

25
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.070
You want them to go into their email like I'm showing right here and open this e-mail that says Please

26
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.770
confirm subscription and when you click yes subscribe me to this list inside of your e-mail.

27
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.380
What happened to me was I went and opened up my browser again and then I went to a second thank you

28
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.130
Now you can see that this one looks a little bit different than the MailChimp standard.

29
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.560
That's because I had done what I discussed in the last video and I forced MailChimp to go and send the

30
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.510
with my own branding and my own look.

31
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.770
Now this thank you page is the place where you want to put the link to the reward they're going to get

32
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.610
when they join the email list.

33
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.440
thank you page.

34
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.380
Any time could go back to my e-mail and I received a second e-mail here from MailChimp and I have it

35
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.370
It says your subscription has been confirmed and this is the second place where I could offer them a

36
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.670
Mind Map or whatever the reward is actually have it so that when they click that link in their email

37
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.820
they go directly to that same thank you page where they can download.

38
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.690
This is a PTF document that then would open in the browser

39
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.040
and so back at our Web site here we can talk about inside of this widget or wherever we want to where

40
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.380
We can talk about how.

41
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.380
Hey if you fill out the form above you're not just subscribing to the mailing list but you're going

42
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.890
information that we give out and sell in our website.

43
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.830
You can see the applications for business whether online or physical forgiving PTF e-book or a white

44
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.320
That has to do with the topic of the business.

45
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.540
So let's duplicate that system that I had created by going into MailChimp and customizing those four

46
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.080
First if you're not still on it go to the sign up form page and click general forums and you'll get

47
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.700
Open up that down drop down and let's look at the sign up.

48
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.320
Thank you page so this thank you page.

49
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.120
We need to confirm your email address.

50
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:54.540
And so what we'll do is go down and let's click the edit button right here and let's just put a sentence

51
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.020
your free item go out and edit your own page and then click save and close at the top right.

52
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.480
Next let me just point out that you can instead of showing this thank you page you can send your subscribers

53
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.270
by going to pages add new as you already know how to do.

54
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.910
And then you'll find the permalink for that page and bring it on back into MailChimp and paste it right

55
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.230
If you leave this blank then they'll use their default.

56
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.580
But you would want to give them a message up here that says we need to confirm your email address and

57
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.550
All right let's go back to MailChimp and let's customize our second piece the next one will be the opt

58
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.950
This is the one that MailChimp sense to them that has the link to confirm and you don't want to alter

59
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.470
You need to have the link here.

60
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.020
And of course it's not editable here inside of this MailChimp area but you can go ahead and edit the

61
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.750
a link to the free item that we're offering you and I say here it will also come in the welcome email.

62
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.650
So put a little sentence there and and hit save and close.

63
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.680
You're only putting it into the next two items.

64
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.590
Back inside of MailChimp.

65
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.920
Let's go back up and let's open the dropdown once again and look at our third item that will be customizing.

66
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.550
This one is the confirmation.

67
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.900
Thank you page.

68
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:58.130
So users will go to this thank you page as soon as they click the confirmation link in their e-mail.

69
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.670
Now this is where you want to offer them the download and you can see that I've got it here.

70
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.690
I'll click Edit and you guys can do the same thing.

71
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.430
Choose a sentence and write.

72
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:23.620
real link right here you could put just a hash tag there and that will make it look like a link but

73
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.900
So I'm just going to cancel out of that and close since mine is already set up.

74
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.470
The fourth item is the last and final welcome email.

75
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.820
Now you do have to have this box checked so that MailChimp will send a final welcome email.

76
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:47.810
But I think it's a good idea to include a link either to your thank you page or to the PTF download

77
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.810
you offer to them up here and they're sitting there later on and they've opened their e-mail and they're

78
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.140
Ah here is a link to it.

79
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.420
they submitted inside the form.

80
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:19.680
And as a final challenge for this video I want you to go into your Wordpress dashboard go ahead and

81
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.070
you right here.

82
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:37.990
Just like I've done here and then get the permalink copy that to your clipboard and paste it into the

83
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.200
address.

84
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.520
Pause the video now and give it a go out.

85
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.540
That went well for you.

86
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.950
But let me show you a couple of things to take note of.

87
00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:01.120
I'm going to call this the just the thank you for confirming.

88
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.620
Thank you page.

89
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:10.080
And when I click down into the body area I'm going to write here or download.

90
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.610
And of course you know I would select that and add a link.

91
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:19.930
And I'm just going to put a hashtag in there and apply it so that it looks like a link and then I can

92
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.280
There's a couple of things to take note of here.

93
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.860
One is that they you are l or the permalink of this page says thank you for confirming and I don't know

94
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.110
a or was just a string of letters and numbers that was hard to remember.

95
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.950
If you want to keep people from just sharing this link easily you might want to just do that and make

96
00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.340
So back here in wordpress the way you do that is just click Edit and that gives you an opportunity to

97
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.610
can click Update great.

98
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.510
MailChimp and I'm going to just replace on to that.

99
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.920
Remember we've got to be in the confirmation.

100
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.650
We don't want to put this link in the thank you page.

101
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.040
Our download link.

102
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:44.790
Then we'll be making sure that they will want to opt in because they'll be getting the reward afterward.

103
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:51.690
And that way we can make sure we get everyone's express permission to send them emails and to join the

104
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.680
control V.

105
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:08.020
Or you could of course also click right click and hit paste and then you'd click Save right here.

106
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.310
I'm not going to save that because I'm keeping my old system and I'll just go back into the Sign-Up

107
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:22.810
forms page here so it doesn't save that link finally let's go back and look inside of the Wordpress

108
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:40.300
under the settings and the reading settings with a live web site for you or for a client you should

109
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:52.420
You can leave that checked if you're building the site and you don't want them to see or list in their

110
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.030
You know the development areas or the Lorem if some text that you're using but leave that unchecked

111
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:04.570
if this is a live site to be found by Google and searchers on the Internet there's one quick point we

112
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.690
If this is our thank you page for joining the list we don't want Google to list this page inside their

113
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:27.850
And so one of the things we can do is make this page a no index no follow meaning that we will be telling

114
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.730
Now you can easily do this through using a plug in wordpress and I'll recommend that we go ahead and

115
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:53.100
Yost se of y o a s t.

116
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.350
So go ahead and go to the plugins add new page.

117
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:04.850
Search for Yost SEO and find the used Ezio plug in click Install now and let it install and let's activate

118
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:16.630
can see and how they list specific pages on our website.

119
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:22.370
So now that we have that plug in activated we can go back to the page that we made which was our thank

120
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:33.880
And now that Yost ex-CEO is activated we can scroll down inside of that page and we can look at the

121
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.280
Yost SEO section down here.

122
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.280
robots index that we want to control.

123
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.540
engines.

124
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:05.130
And then if there's a link we don't want search engines to follow from there like a link to a download

125
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:10.730
We don't don't want them to place a link to our special download in their directories either.

126
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:17.170
Now that we've made that selection we can just click Update and we've basically hidden our thank you

127
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.870
In this lesson you customize the experience for those who sign up for your email list.

128
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:41.540
free exclusive download while hiding it from other visitors and preventing it from being listed in the

129
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:48.740
In the next video you'll go back into one of your sites in the student's sandbox at W.P. of course dot

130
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.010
theme.

131
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.710
Let's go
