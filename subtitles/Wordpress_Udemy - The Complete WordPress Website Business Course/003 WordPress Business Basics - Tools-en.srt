00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,920
Let's get into specifics in this video you'll learn how WordPress websites fit with domain name registration

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,890
and hosting on a server and get all the other pieces together on your computer outside of Wordpress

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,810
You'll gather all the tools you need for this course including setting up your students sandbox at W.P.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,450
of course dot com giving you access to premium tools you can use in your business.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,450
from the ground up.

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,170
Let's start with hosting.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,590
It's a Web site needs to have files and a database that are accessible to the public through their Internet

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,690
It needs a physical place to be.

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,920
This is called a hosting account.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,970
There are lots of different levels and types of hosting and we'll go over these in detail in the next

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,230
For now just know that a hosting company provides a server connected to the Internet in such a way that

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,970
a Web site.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,610
They either click or type an address or a URL to get there you are.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:18,170
L stands for universal resource locator and it's just a quick way to say web address or domain name

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,830
an example of a r rl is Google dot com.

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,630
One of the requirements of having a public Web site is ownership of a domain name which has a specific

17
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:37,010
URL that you or your clients can register using a company called a domain name registrar.

18
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,930
Network Solutions dot com and many others you rent or register a domain name for a specific period of

19
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,420
its own L or web address.

20
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,020
When we are developing a web site locally or before our client has a domain name yet we can use a temporary

21
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,790
real domain name.

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,180
During this course you can use real domain names that you register yourself or just use testing yourself

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,220
to create the Web sites will make during the learning process.

24
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,820
If you do use a real domain name you'll have to have a paid or trial hosting account to which you can

25
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,440
the next section.

26
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,570
In the last section you learned about how WordPress works with a file structure and a database to output

27
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,530
You also saw how themes and plugins can be added to design a look and feel as well as provide specific

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,370
In this course you'll have an opportunity to use a whole bunch of premium themes and plug ins to create

29
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,120
your development sandbox and all the premium tools will be learning in this course.

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:16,700
After this video go to W.P. of course dot com and click the student's button to get your sandbox site

31
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,910
ready.

32
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,080
There's an exclusive code for students of this course.

33
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,240
You'll need to use to gain permission and set up your sandbox environment.

34
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,000
It's located in the resource document in the next section.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,100
Let's compile all the other tools you need for building websites for clients.

36
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,240
First go get a text or code editor you can use the simple text editor that comes with your computer

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,960
notepad on Windows or text it on the Mac.

38
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,480
But as I said in the last section you'd be better served by getting a code editor that formats the code

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You can try notepad plus plus or atom that IO but don't rely on word pad that comes with Windows or

40
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,380
These don't do the same thing and can insert formatting characters that aren't part of the code you

41
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,230
There's text Wrangler and Adam works as well.

42
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,500
Here's what the Wordpress config file looks like in ADOM and here's what it looks like in Notepad plus

43
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:34,440
But here's what it looks like in Notepad itself not formatted and not as good looking or easy to edit

44
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,390
as it looks like an atom.

45
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,470
Download one of these code editors now and install one on your computer.

46
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,390
You are L's to all these code editors are in the resource document in the next section to set up an

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,790
FPP program.

48
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:57,110
One of the best ways is to choose an add on for the Firefox browser called Fire FGP install Firefox

49
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:08,930
If you don't have it already and open it up at the top you can click Tools and add ons and Firefox will

50
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,680
Fire FGP and hit enter and you can install the add on.

51
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,760
You can get to the fire FGP add on by clicking the menu dropdown at the top right here.

52
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,320
But I've already dragged it up into my toolbar.

53
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,280
So if you click customize on that menu right there you'll be able to drag and move your toolbar items

54
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,160
to and fro.

55
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,350
This is where it probably starts and if you drag that up somewhere on your toolbar that will provides

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,270
That way anytime you need it the FCP program is right at your fingertips and it will open in a new tab.

57
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,040
There it is the left side or the files on my computer and I can set up accounts here connect to them

58
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:19,000
Another option is to use a standalone FDCPA program like files Zilah available at files Zyla dash project

59
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,960
dark

60
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,270
go ahead and get yourself set up with an FPP program on your computer.

61
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,990
Let's take a look at two of them and try optimizing an image for the web yourself.

62
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:47,260
If you have Adobe Photoshop follow along in the next section and if not open up pick seler dot com and

63
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,580
First let's get a large image that's too big in terms of both file size and image size and place it

64
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:15,410
There's one you can download and use at WP dev course dot com slash big image dot J peg.

65
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:23,880
If you don't have one of your own ready you can just use this right click the image and say save image

66
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,330
as find a place on your computer where you want to save it and there you go.

67
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,870
This image is straight out of my camera full of 3.6 megabytes in size and more than 30 400 pixels wide

68
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,060
for any image on a Web site.

69
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:49,350
The file size should be at largest less than 300 K or kilobytes and less than 2000 pixels wide even

70
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:58,860
I like to make my web images 6500 pixels wide and I try to get them as small as possible under 200 K

71
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,170
Image editing programs can do this with most photos without losing any image quality.

72
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,250
These smaller compressed images will load faster for web site visitors making for a better web site

73
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,960
Watch as I open this image in Photoshop and if you have the program follow along and do this to your

74
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:31,050
Once I have the image opened in Photoshop or click image image size and under the width I'll put 6900

75
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,730
and just hit OK.

76
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,070
Now as showing it to me at 25 percent.

77
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,780
Now I'll click file save for web and devices.

78
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,830
This will optimize the image and show me an optimized version if I like.

79
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,270
I can go up here and click JPEG you'll show me the image at full size so I can browse around to the

80
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,920
If I hit medium I can see that that will be an 84 K image and the quality is very good.

81
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,630
I might go up to high and that's 2:21.

82
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,140
In fact I think it looks really good.

83
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,110
Right here and then I'll click save when I save this file on my computer.

84
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,500
Photoshop but opens within a browser window instead of being a standalone program.

85
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,260
If you navigate to pixel or dot com you can launch the web app under Pichler editor you can use the

86
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
it does in Photoshop.

87
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,060
That's fun my image here.

88
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,760
Big image

89
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:08,090
click image and then image size right here I can put 6500 pixels as I did before and leave the constrained

90
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,930
That means that it won't distort or stretch the image at all.

91
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,830
It'll keep it in the same proportions.

92
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:23,330
Now that that's a smaller image in pixel or I can click File Save and in the dialog box it'll give me

93
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,430
I can see that this will be 211 kilobytes if I pull it down just a little bit.

94
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,260
I get 158.

95
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:42,710
Let's go ahead and save that in this web folder and we can go and see what it looks like after it's

96
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,260
And here it is.

97
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,360
Let's take a look.

98
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,230
Unlike Photoshop it doesn't give you a live optimized version that you can look at but you can experiment

99
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,950
If you use Microsoft Office with Excel spreadsheets you can use existing templates for quotations and

100
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,330
you can see I can open just a blank splodge spreadsheet or some other templates here under business.

101
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,040
It's searching office dot com since I'm online.

102
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,600
Or you can use the search bar and you can see that there's a whole bunch of templates that you can choose

103
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,190
If I search for invoice I can find the one that I usually use invoice that calculates total.

104
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,390
And then you can download it and it'll save it as a template in Excel.

105
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,490
I use one called price quotation without tax.

106
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,570
to find what works for you.

107
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,110
But either of these can use a logo and can be customized for your business.

108
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,980
Once I've created an invoice for a client I just click File Save As and save the document as a PTF

109
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,390
then it can be edited and the class can open it up and pay using the methods I specify.

110
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:42,090
You can also do this using the free Google Drive documents navigate drive at Google dot com and log

111
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,290
If you go back to their welcome page after signing in.

112
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,000
Click the menu grid at the top right and then click.

113
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:59,960
Dr. click new at the top left and open up a new Google sheet.

114
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,760
You can do a google search for invoice for Google sheets and there are lots of templates that you can

115
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,820
when you need to make a new invoice.

116
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:28,260
Once you have a new one finished you can click file download as and choose PTF to download a finished

117
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,940
I receive a lot of payments from clients via check but at times you'll want to be able to take a credit

118
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,070
It can feel like a big step to accept credit cards through a merchant account at your bank.

119
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,270
And if you research it it's pretty expensive and complicated with applications and credit checks to

120
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,100
available to everyone without a hassle or any upfront fees.

121
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,990
You can set up PayPal to take both one time and recurring payments very quickly and easily.

122
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
They charge the seller.

123
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,960
That's you.

124
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,450
A small fee for processing the credit card and they take that percentage out of the payment after it's

125
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,140
They don't charge the buyer at all.

126
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,350
at a bank.

127
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,420
Plus your clients can feel comfortable with the security of their information as PayPal keeps it secure

128
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,190
and you can't actually access their credit card information at all.

129
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,840
Paypal takes care of it.

130
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,970
You can also send invoices via email through paypal allowing your customers to just click a link in

131
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:57,380
the top right choose a business account and then click continue and choose Pay-Pal payments standard.

132
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,450
set to take credit cards paypal payments standard is all you need to take recurring payments for website

133
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,650
maintenance or hosting for your clients as well as onetime payments for web design and implementation.

134
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,450
In this video we went over and compiled a lot of the tools we'll need to create our complete WordPress

135
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,390
sandbox resource and lots of free tools.

136
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,330
We've assembled everything you need for your website business.

137
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,060
Next we'll dive deeply into how to host client web sites.

138
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,150
and get your students sandbox set up and running for coursework.
