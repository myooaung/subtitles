1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,170
In this video you'll incorporate a contact form into the site including an instance of the form in the

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,720
a fancy pop up to the contact form 7 user notification messages.

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,580
If we look at the executive Frot site we've been working on there's a contact page that we've already

4
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:39,160
Or if you haven't go ahead and look at that contact page using the Wordpress dashboard and then opening

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,020
They'll use a gravity form short code that's to be used with the gravity forms plug in.

6
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,680
replace this.

7
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:04,780
And the content here on the Contact page itself log into the Wordpress dashboard and make sure you're

8
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,690
ins.

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,220
We'd like to activate so that we can use the contact form 7 plug in that you've used before in your

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,800
Now that I have those two plug ins activated I can go up under contact in the menu and look at the contact

11
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:51,650
form that has name email and subject line and message as a text area and we'll be editing this contact

12
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,540
Here's a small challenge for you in addition to the name and email.

13
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:14,080
required then edit the mail that gets sent to you to populate that e-mail with the telephone number

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,550
for a video now and give it a try.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,390
I hope you did well with that.

16
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,460
Here's how I do it.

17
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:41,670
tags I mean I hit Control C and copy that and paste it in here and label it with your phone number.

18
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,300
OK.

19
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,830
Now instead of e-mail your email that code short code is going to be different so I'm going to click

20
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:01,510
I'm in a click required field and I'm just going to leave it as the default and I can say insert tag

21
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,120
inserted where the code was.

22
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,880
In fact if I save this first this might be easier.

23
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,050
I go to mail right here and I can select that one.

24
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:22,810
Now that it knows that it is there so name email subject and just blow the message body

25
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,980
type phone number

26
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,560
and place it there.

27
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,560
Now save the contact for great.

28
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,270
I hope you come through as easily as I did.

29
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,960
Let's go and look at the pop up message at ONS tab because we've activated the pop up message at.

30
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,300
We were able to choose from these pop up message add ons instead of having messages that just appear

31
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,610
below the submit button.

32
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:03,170
Any of these messages will be displayed when the person hits the submit button.

33
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,380
colors.

34
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:20,320
So let's pick a color that matches I like this blue with the green button and the white lettering.

35
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,790
So if I just click that and hit save we can test that in a moment.

36
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,300
Now I'd just like to show you quickly where I got this pop up ma message add ons plug in from the Vado

37
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,910
I can click here and go to the Vado market and I'll admit I didn't buy this plug in.

38
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,100
they were giving away.

39
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:56,030
And because I use the contact form seven plug in it was a great freebie for me to get.

40
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,200
So if I choose code Kanyon that's where WordPress plugins exist and

41
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,190
I'll just type the title and see if I can find it contact form 7 pop up message.

42
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,140
And I got it for free.

43
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,260
But it's part of our premium plugins inside the student's sandbox and it's a nice plug in available

44
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,120
Let's populate our contact page with the correct short code and maybe a short message about filling

45
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,940
So I'll go back to the Wordpress dashboard or go back to the contact form itself and just click there

46
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:55,510
Now go to pages and all pages inside of my wordpress Web site with executive pro and since there's a

47
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,220
I want to find that page called contact page.

48
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,340
If you have a lot of pages or a lot of posts the search bar up here is very useful inside the Wordpress

49
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,090
So open contact page and let's put instead of this.

50
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,790
You know I'm going to go ahead and erase all that there and put the short code there first but above

51
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,500
I'll just update that page.

52
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:43,570
And let's take a look at it and fill out a sample contact form and look at our pop up great.

53
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,350
And the e-mail and the phone number is there subject to message.

54
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,740
And then a send button

55
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,320
just filling out the form here as if I was a customer.

56
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,310
Here's my question.

57
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,190
And when I hit send I get a nice pop up where does the background and I have to read that it's been

58
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,600
OK.

59
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,590
Now if there was an error that would be very obvious and I could tell what was going on.

60
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,180
Now let's make a contact form that's visually visible on every page of the website including the home

61
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,180
Your challenge is to paste that same short code into a footer widget and arrange your footers so that

62
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,870
Pozza video now and give it a try.

63
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,430
How'd it go.

64
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Well let's see how I get on doing the challenge.

65
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,280
I go back to the Wordpress dashboard.

66
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm going to want to use the Customize there so that I can see in live editing mode what my changes

67
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,110
And I'll go to widgets and I'm going to edit.

68
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,830
Let's see if I scroll down to the bottom.

69
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,140
I think I'll leave the company profile.

70
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,910
I can get rid of this recent posts and potentially put that contact form straight in the middle here

71
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,470
and see what it looks like there.

72
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,450
And the way I'll put my contact form in there is I'll just make a text widget and placed that sure code

73
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,120
that I had pasted into our contact page.

74
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,870
Here's a text widget I could title it.

75
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,080
Contact us and in the content.

76
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,160
Nice.

77
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,020
Now of course it's very long.

78
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,530
This isn't bad.

79
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:54,890
You know this is visible on say every page of the Web site if I look at just a page you know as you

80
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:05,870
Now it's pretty long so what I might do is play some more content inside of the contact area inside

81
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,430
would be a good idea or some more content over here on the right side as well.

82
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,050
In this video you added a contact form to the contact page as well as to the footer so it's visible

83
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,220
You also chose a color scheme for the premium add on pop up message for contact form 7 in the next chapter

84
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,220
will start a fresh new project inside the student sandbox and create a modern scrolling home page layout

85
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,130
using another Genesys premium child theme will explore the home page layouts that studio press uses

86
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,820
plugin
