3
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,640
But for W.P. of course students they've provided a 60 day demo site for coursework and testing.

4
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,680
an exclusive W.P. Of course student discount if you want to continue with flywheel.

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,420
The coupon code on the student resources page gives you at least hundred dollars off an annual ball

6
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,100
If you want to get set up to resell hosting to your clients Let's check it out.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,710
Just like in the last video.

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,950
Let's start by going to the student dot W.P..

9
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:06,220
Of course dot com resources page and that's available if you click the link at the top or the button

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,950
as you scroll down from the home page down here.

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,110
Just click resource page and on this page as you scroll down just a little bit there is a link to the

12
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:32,770
You can use that later click the flywheel link and you'll go to a flywheel Sign-Up page exclusive to

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:41,100
I've already filled out some of the fields right here clicked the Agree button and then I clicked sign

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,060
I was taken then to a page with a welcome video where I already had an active account.

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,460
Go ahead and take those steps for yourself and once you have an active account at flywheel you'll also

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,710
with your username and your e-mail you've used and a log in page.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,940
Again like the site Ground account I'll bookmark this log in page which is app dot get flywheel dot

18
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,920
Back inside of the browser there's one more step you need to take to activate your site and be able

19
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:39,240
If you just click new site you'll see that you'll get to a create a new WordPress site page but don't

20
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,700
right here.

21
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,560
There you'll be able to go and verify with a text message to your phone or you can enter a credit card.

22
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,660
I'm going to verify with a text message and you can do the same.

23
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,310
Just place your phone number right in there and click send code and it will give you a message.

24
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,940
And then you just enter the six digit code that they send to your phone.

25
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:25,760
Straight in here and click verify I'm going to enter my six digit code.

26
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,410
It came in about two seconds straight to my phone and now my accounts been verified.

27
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,160
So that means if I want to roll over and click the new site button I'm right here on the create a new

28
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,920
I'm just going to enter a few details in here.

29
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,280
Pause the video and I'll start it back up when I'm ready.

30
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,410
I chose a username for my wordpress site that I would remember and a password that I put in twice that

31
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,720
Also you can choose your own temporary domain and it'll be whatever you put a place here.

32
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,330
Dot flywheel sites dot com.

33
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,630
pointed to the site.

34
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,980
As you scroll down you'll see that you can pay now or you can add it to a book plan if you have one

35
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,960
where you can click.

36
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,930
My client will pay later.

37
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,090
I'll just scroll to the bottom and click launch a demo site

38
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,710
and it really only took a few seconds for this site to be created for me.

39
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:45,160
You can see that it says I have 61 days left at the top of my dashboard for this site and it is password

40
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,940
be asked for a username and password and they use an interesting memorable password system.

41
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,780
News at this point and that can be changed.

42
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:10,020
The user name is always flywheel and so all I have to do is go up here and click WordPress log in and

43
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,850
that will open up a new tab.

44
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,970
And this is a browser authentication that flywheel places just as an additional layer of protection.

45
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,820
Or so you can hide your development site while it's being made from clients or anyone else.

46
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,360
I know that the user name is flywheel and this is where that memorable password comes in handy

47
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:41,390
because if you don't remember it you can't go back to a previous tab when you're using browser authentication.

48
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,490
And so I remember that password and it all hit.

49
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,540
OK I can have my browser remember that for future use.

50
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,030
And now I'm at the standard WordPress log in page.

51
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:59,310
I can put my user name that I chose along with my memorable password that I picked and click loggin

52
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,690
I'll have the browser remember that password as well.

53
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,430
And there I am that great feeling comes over me when I get a new fresh WordPress installation started

54
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,450
again.

55
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,310
We've got the welcome to WordPress standard message that I can dismiss by clicking at the top right.

56
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,510
And if I go over to plugins installed plugins just like we did before.

57
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:30,580
There's no standard plug ins loaded inside of your demo sites but I will take those couple of steps

58
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,070
And if you'd like Pazz the video now and go ahead and make those steps yourself.

59
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,590
I hope you could remember those little changes that we made to set up our site for development in the

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
But I'll show you what I always do.

61
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,260
I'll go into settings general and then I'll just name the site if I want to.

62
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:12,080
and I'll just type experimentation as I usually do and the addresses are there.

63
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,880
We'll scroll down a little bit further and I'll choose my own time zone and I'll go to the bottom and

64
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,360
Then I go to the media settings and always uncheck this organize my uploads into month and year based

65
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:42,530
Grade the last one is permalink and I click Post name because that is the best Ezio.

66
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,770
And it's just a habit of mine to create that from the very beginning and I'll click save changes.

67
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,340
Now there's one more plug in that's permanently installed inside of flywheel sites which is called limit

68
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,110
Let's just check it out.

69
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,110
What we'll do is look at the limit log in attempts settings just so we know what they do.

70
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,260
and slowing down your sites that are at a managed WordPress host like flywheel.

71
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:22,130
So it only allows four times before the 20 minute lockout occurs.

72
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:29,600
And then you can only have four lockouts and then you'll be increased to 24 hours of lockouts.

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,120
You don't have to change the options right here.

74
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,880
But it's good to know that this exists in the flywheel sites.

75
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,930
Well that's it.

76
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,350
Let's check it out.

77
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:52,600
The title of the site and right click visit site and open it in a new tab.

78
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,190
Now if I look at it this is my site.

79
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Great.

80
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,110
One of the things I like to do as well that we didn't talk about in the last video is to get rid of

81
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,920
that loggin admin bar at the top here.

82
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,160
To do that go back into the Wordpress dashboard and under users click your profile.

83
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,860
You can also get there from rolling over your name up here and clicking at it my profile what I'll do

84
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,710
Now when I go back to the live site and click refresh or reload that's what the site really looks like

85
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,660
to visitors at this point.

86
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,080
In this video you sign up for the excellent managed WordPress host flywheel where you get an exclusive

87
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,080
you can use your flywheel account for no charge as part of your coursework or to develop websites for

88
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,730
You can also set up your business to host your sites in one of their bulk accounts and resell the hosting

89
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,410
You'll install a map to set up a complete server on your local computer and you'll be installing WordPress

90
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,700
manually by hosting WordPress on your local computer.

91
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,940
You'll be able to develop Web sites privately.

92
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,990
Experiment with Wordpress and create projects without relying on an external server or needing an internet

93
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,750
See there
