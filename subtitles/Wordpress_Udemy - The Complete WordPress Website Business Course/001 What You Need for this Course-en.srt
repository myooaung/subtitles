00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,220
One of the best things about Wordpress is that it's open source software which means that it's freely

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,540
All the tools you need for this course are also freely available as long as you have a computer and

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,710
Let's take a look.

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,030
In this video you'll learn a few different options for the tools needed to complete this course.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,130
By the end you'll have everything you need in one place to complete the course and create a WordPress

6
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,200
First you'll need a computer with internet access.

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,760
And while we'll be doing a lot of our website development off line using a local environment you'll

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,990
We will be using the worldwide web to download the tools and resources needed to build a complete business

9
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,820
as well as to develop and present websites live on the Internet.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,840
On your computer you'll need a modern browser that delivers websites and connects to the Internet using

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,930
I recommend having both Mozilla Firefox as I'm showing here and Google Chrome installed as we will be

12
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,240
Safari on the Mac is also a good modern browser.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,700
Well Internet Explorer for Windows is nice to have for testing your final websites as a part of your

14
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,170
We won't be using it for website development itself.

15
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:42,010
Your computer most likely has a text editor included in the operating system like notepad on Windows

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,320
and textedit on the Mac.

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,150
You can use these but there are also some free code editors you can use that make it a little easier

18
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,840
The files will be editing these code editors use syntax highlighting and monitor code formatting for

19
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:06,910
Check out notepad plus plus for Windows text wrangler for the Mac and add them on both platforms.

20
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,900
If T-P stands for file transfer protocol and will use one of these programs to upload and download files

21
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,880
on the Mac to transfer files to and from the local server on your computer.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,300
free options.

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:49,490
for Windows or Mac and finally will need some way to optimize and format pictures graphics and all kinds

24
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,660
You'll be learning how to size images and compress them properly so you'll need an image editing program

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,750
like Adobe Photoshop.

26
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,630
You can get it for 1995 a month at this time but if you don't already have Photoshop there are many

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,130
I Pycke dotcom is a great web based photo editor.

28
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:27,740
GIMP is a longtime free competitor to Adobe Photoshop Google photos which used to be Google Picasa Bixler

29
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:37,250
is another good one based on the web photo or is a browser based photo editor and on one effects has

30
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,630
So to recap you've hopefully pause the video a few times and downloaded or found the tools you need

31
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,580
If not go ahead and review the info we've covered to get yourself set up and ready to create your website

32
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,030
business.

33
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,800
We'll also go over some of the business tools you can use for managing invoices taking payments and

34
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,450
See there
