1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,670
In this video you'll download and activate a new theme for the site completely changing the look and

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,710
You'll see that while the content of the site stays exactly the same we can change the theme and make

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,280
This is the beauty of using WordPress.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,230
It's a content management system which lets us separate the core information from the style and manner

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,030
After this video you'll have a handle on what it takes to work in a staging environment using best practices

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,260
for backups as well as seamless migrations.

7
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,900
It's a free theme that's pretty modern and looks great and it's actually available first at Wordpress

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,180
But if you go to the homepage of Wordpress dot com you can download a theme copy for your Wordpress

9
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,930
So go ahead and go to WordPress dot com slash themes slash affinity and you can download a copy for

10
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:40,260
I'll just go to appearance theme's and since it's a themed zip file we can click Add new and just upload

11
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,700
In my downloads folder there it is.

12
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,360
Here's an error that sometimes might occur.

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,100
The uploaded file exceeds the upload max file size directive in P.H. dot.

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:10,510
I and I that means that the maximum allowable file size via the HP settings is less than the amount

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,130
If you search for something like P-H BMX file size you'll get a lot of different tutorials on how to

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,870
Basically there's two ways you can edit the HD access file or you can edit the HP Dot and I file both

17
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:39,660
If I go to the downloads folder and take a look at it right it's 5 megabytes 5.3 megabytes in size.

18
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,710
And so here's how we're going to get around that.

19
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,380
First I'll just head back to get back to the dashboard

20
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,270
and I can actually check my settings there by going to add a new piece of media add new maximum file

21
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,990
is to place a code directive with HP inside the HD access file.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,280
Now if we look at the file structure just a little bit under the live site folder with all the core

23
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:37,440
now because it's starting the filename starts with a dot a dot preceding the filename defines it as

24
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,200
structure.

25
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:52,140
And if you open up that file within your code editor or Adam as I have here you can see the file name

26
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:59,490
Dot H.T. access is the name of the H.T. access file so there's some code that you can place and we're

27
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,190
And this works inside a map server and it may or may not work the same way at a live server but if we

28
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:17,010
define a PH p value and then a space and then type upload underscore Max underscore file size.

29
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,870
That's a directive that's accepted in the Apache server and in wordpress.

30
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,690
This means eight megabytes.

31
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:35,190
So if I control S and save that file now my H.T. access file is newly defined and if I hit refresh

32
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,090
that BHP directive will tell WordPress.

33
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,660
OK go ahead and accept files that are up to eight megabytes.

34
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:54,630
So now I can go back into appearance theme's and click the Add New and then the following button upload

35
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,070
great.

36
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,860
Now if I just click activate on the affinity theme

37
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,150
great now let's go ahead and refresh the page you'll see that the look and feel has changed drastically

38
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,350
but everything still makes sense within the theme.

39
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:39,340
You can scroll down and there's the Post's three two and one with their featured images everything looks

40
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,380
Even my footer areas I might lay that out slightly differently for this site but for now I've changed

41
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,850
Let's see what our portfolio page looks like.

42
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,430
Great it's got a large header image and I might change the layout because of this wider column width

43
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,680
even though I have some edits to do.

44
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,200
I have to fix that menu item to say home instead of number two.

45
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,730
That's the sample page

46
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,520
great.

47
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,420
So your task is to upload this affinity theme and activate it in your local environment.

48
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,900
And then go ahead and make a few edits like this menu button and maybe arranging the gallery in the

49
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,960
it.

50
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,410
So then we'll have a new site up here.

51
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,360
Now before I do that I want to make sure that I take a backup so I already know that I have an export

52
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,050
I brought it into my computer under live site and then I imported it into here.

53
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,540
And what I'd like you guys to do is download affinity activate it and then make those theme edits and

54
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,680
Did you get your say edited and then uploaded and replaced the live site with no downtime.

55
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,660
I hope so.

56
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,230
Check out how I would do it.

57
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,500
First I'll change this menu item.

58
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:34,940
But what I discovered when I went into menu in the dashboard is that this is just the default menu that

59
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,290
is all the pages on the site that was set as default as part of the theme.

60
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:54,670
portfolio so when I went in the menus you could see if I managed the locations that this team offers

61
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,230
there's one location just tap and there's no menu assigned to it right now.

62
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,160
So I'll go ahead.

63
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,640
Go ahead and sign my head or menu and save the changes.

64
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,720
And then I shouldn't have to edit anything.

65
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,980
Yeah that's good.

66
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,600
Great.

67
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,680
As I scroll down to the footer that's where all my footer widgets.

68
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,620
Here's the four on the right hand side.

69
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:31,730
And this was my other sidebar which it will have to go into widgets and see what widgets are populated

70
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,750
with what content looks like I have three footer widgets available to me and one side bar.

71
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,180
This is shown in the recent posts.

72
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,940
That's fine and I think I'll move there.

73
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:52,880
One of the footer category widgets just up there let's see if I refresh this page I'll move it up alongside

74
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,490
the content in the sidebar.

75
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,950
That looks great.

76
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,880
OK so now I have four Let's see where those are at.

77
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,280
I might have all those widgets.

78
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,930
Yeah I do.

79
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:28,260
categories widget which is a duplicate and the about me text I'll put in the third footer widget area.

80
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,920
It saves them like that.

81
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,990
here and a great one to three.

82
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,850
That looks nice.

83
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,770
Now let's take a look.

84
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,920
Great.

85
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,750
This is too big of a font.

86
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:12,400
I was using H-2 I think there but in in this theme the fonts are displayed a little bit differently

87
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,190
much better.

88
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,390
That looks nice.

89
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,790
All right.

90
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:33,270
So now that I have all of my edits done oh there was one more at it actually the portfolio page.

91
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:40,000
I think that these narrow 150 pixel images you know they're a little narrow there for the gallery.

92
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,240
If you click once inside the photo gallery there's an edit button.

93
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:04,770
And over on the right hand side let's change it to the medium size and update the post and see what

94
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,140
Nice.

95
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,910
normal sized captions will look better I think

96
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,780
nice.

97
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,970
And when you click it opens the attachment page

98
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:06,770
Great.

99
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:12,270
And now with the attachment page we might have a problem with these pages all having a full featured

100
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,680
image on them.

101
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:27,740
I mean have it linked to the media file that way when someone clicks the image it will just open that

102
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,720
There we go.

103
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,130
And when you click the image it opens the full size version inside the browser.

104
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,220
Nice.

105
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,380
OK.

106
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,100
Now I've got a complete site ready to go.

107
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:01,490
I can go into my local host development area go in on one and export a file that represents this entire

108
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,230
around is finished making the archive and now I'll download it and it will come into my downloads folder.

109
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,910
I'll pause the video while it does that.

110
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,790
All right.

111
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,460
That's in my downloads folder.

112
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,740
You know I know it's the last one there.

113
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:35,570
The last thing to do is to go into my live site and go ahead and migrate the imported in using the all

114
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,250
Now if this is the live site this is a live domain name I can refresh the page make sure we can see

115
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,690
what someone would see out in the internet that had access to this site right now.

116
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,420
There's the old style.

117
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,940
I know I have a nice one prepared that as soon as I upload it.

118
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,370
If someone were to navigate to the site or hit refresh the new site will load with no break in service

119
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,150
So I'm going to go ahead and import and do I have a backup of this before important change anything.

120
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,730
But I'll import it from the file.

121
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,190
There it is right there hit open.

122
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,950
Now since this is uploading to the Internet live it's going to take a little while to upload this many

123
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,770
Now that's uploaded.

124
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,700
Great.

125
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,350
Nice.

126
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,670
Oh let's change the general settings away from the word live.

127
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,430
Let's see what our new live site looks like if someone were to be browsing now.

128
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,130
Comes right up.

129
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,530
in this video.

130
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,550
You changed the theme and made a brand new site out of the same content all in your local staging environment.

131
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,570
Then by uploading the completed site you kept the live site active while making changes in the background

132
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,880
and avoiding any downtime or the need for a temporary main screen.

133
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,930
Great job.

134
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,880
Next chapter will delve into the topic of premium themes frameworks and child themes.
