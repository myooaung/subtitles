1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,150
In this video you'll customize your first Genesys child theme from Studio press inside the student's

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,710
options for their child themes.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,440
We'll check out the Genesis framework and understand the difference between using a child theme that

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,380
First navigator's students W.P. of course dotcom.

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,370
We're going to be opening up your sandbox environment that you created in a previous chapter.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,930
button.

7
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,820
But if you have created one already you can click log in at the top right and go ahead and log in with

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,430
That will open your website dashboard where at the top you can see the name of the site and the visit

9
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,990
So we can go back and forth and do some edits.

10
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,600
You can see that the default site that comes up is the same theme as the one in student dot W.P. of

11
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:31,310
inside this theme as your default which is the home page of the Genesis child theme one of the things

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,670
that you've learned that I like to do is to go in to the dashboard when I first open my wordpress installation

13
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,420
and edit my profile page and uncheck the toolbar checkbox.

14
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,840
I like to have the toolbar absent from the top of the front facing site when I'm looking at it so that

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,420
A few of the unique things about the parallax pro child theme is that it's got this background images

16
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:18,640
And it's got this custom home page template that is powered by widgets within Genesis.

17
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,520
If you haven't already take a small tour of this home page there's a nice button.

18
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,770
It doesn't link anywhere but it's just a small piece of code in the home page widget that provides a

19
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,450
A sample page brings you to one of the interior pages that posts and pages will look like you can see

20
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:58,530
The interior pages these are pull images that stick out beyond the margins of a column where the words

21
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:09,060
And there's an easy way that we'll experiment with to place those outside the column or within the column.

22
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,920
We go back to the home page.

23
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:21,050
We can go down past the next section and you can see that there's also a nice dropdown menu item system

24
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:28,810
up here and the default color is red.

25
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,730
And so that's like an alternative color.

26
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,080
That's kind of a highlight color within the theme.

27
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:42,860
Also very changeable using the Genesis parent and child themes from Studio press.

28
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:50,510
Finally this very bottom footer is a standard footer that looks very similar to this on most of the

29
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,150
And we'll be editing this content using a plugin.

30
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,440
go ahead and roll over appearance.

31
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,800
We've played with the customize or a little bit before but you can see that there's a lot more items

32
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,050
parallax pro theme.

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,540
Let's just go through each of them in the site identity go ahead and change the title and the tagline

34
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,620
to anything you like.

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,050
You can see that as always the customize or gives you a live preview.

36
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,540
Now it's trying to preview the changes but the tagline does not actually appear on the header or the

37
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,520
In this theme

38
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,430
great now I don't have to save and publish this.

39
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,940
If you check out the background images these images are the default images that come with the parallax

40
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,800
the White copy comes out looking great on top of the background.

41
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,830
You can choose to leave these images the way they are or choose some large images of your own.

42
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,310
And if you like you can even go into Photoshop or Pichler or another imaging image editing program and

43
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,890
I'm going to go ahead and replace one of these images and by going to the live site right clicking and

44
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,070
how large it is.

45
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,490
This image is 16:00 by 10 50.

46
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,130
I'll hit back so when I go and open my image editor I'll be looking for an image that's at least 6500

47
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,770
I can see that it's fifty one hundred eighty four pixels wide.

48
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:41,280
So I would like to change the size of that to 6500 pixels.

49
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,390
Sixteen hundred by ten sixty seven.

50
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,630
That's close to the width and height of the other image.

51
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,200
I'll just look at it at 50 percent so that I can see the whole thing.

52
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,940
And in Photoshop you can just make some general adjustments.

53
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,280
I want to be sure that the white copy on the Web site will come out looking nice on top of this background

54
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,200
Now as we've done before.

55
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,060
Click file save for web or something similar or similar within your image editing program and I'll use

56
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,800
Let's see it medium.

57
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,040
It does look real nice it's only 188 K..

58
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,650
Now how big does it get when I go to the high setting 392.

59
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,210
That's a little large and the quality is not that much better.

60
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,810
So go to a medium and watch my image.

61
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,040
It looks just fine.

62
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:51,870
So I click save and under you know I'm going to actually make a new folder on my desktop and I'm in

63
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,260
I'll save that image with the same file name right inside of it.

64
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,360
to go ahead and upload an image from my desktop.

65
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:35,850
There's the parallax folder open this image uploads pretty fast because it's only 192 K according to

66
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,250
great you can see that the whites if you have some whites in your image the White copy could get lost.

67
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,440
Other themes that were within the Genesis framework and the studio press stable of themes have a and

68
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:06,110
opacity or a dimming factor that allows the images no matter how bright you upload them to be visible

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,320
in front of the copy parallax.

70
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,440
Let's go back we haven't published any of these changes yet so I'll make sure and remember that if I

71
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,040
and it gives me a recommended size 360 by 70.

72
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,840
And so I'm going to open up Photoshop.

73
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:42,430
I'm going to click file new and I want to create a new file that's exactly the right size for my theme.

74
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:50,660
360 by 70 pixels there is you can see that it's going to fit in the header there very nicely since I

75
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:59,630
see that the theme looks like it would look good with a black background and some white a white logo

76
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,230
I'm going to go ahead go into Photoshop and with black selected.

77
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,890
Yeah.

78
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,190
I'm going to make that a black background and then I'll create my logo.

79
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:24,200
Just real quick I could use any typeface that I like needs to be a lot smaller than that doesn't it.

80
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,320
24 pixels in the color of white

81
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:48,540
or I'll just type parallax pro in white.

82
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,710
Looks like I can make it quite a bit larger.

83
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,130
There we go.

84
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,830
Nice.

85
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:13,570
Now I'll just first save it as a Photoshop document inside of the folder that I have

86
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,920
called parallax logo.

87
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,080
That way I have the original that I can edit if I need to.

88
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,090
But I am going to make that change and save it for web and devices.

89
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,630
And in this case since it's more of a graphic than a photo I should use a PNB file.

90
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,930
Only one kilobyte.

91
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,500
So I'll save that as Parallax logo.

92
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,050
Dot ping.

93
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:54,730
And as I go back into the editor and the customize or I can upload

94
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,870
the parallax logo PLG file

95
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,550
select and crop.

96
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,110
If you have a different size just like we use the logo image in one of our local sites.

97
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,800
I don't need to crop it because I've made it the exact size that it needs to be in Photoshop.

98
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,820
So there's the parallax pro and as I scroll up you can see that the content slides underneath the menu

99
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,800
and the title and the menu stay there in parallel.

100
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,540
Pro is clickable to the home page.

101
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,610
I'm going to go back here now after editing these first three items.

102
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,340
I'll go ahead and save and publish this to make sure I've saved my changes.

103
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,740
Now that we've made a few changes to the home page you can go through and look at what other changes

104
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,280
One of the largest places to look and to see what all the content is that I've included here as a part

105
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:08,040
Are the widgets areas these widgets areas obviously labeled home section 1 through 5 are for the home

106
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,480
The header right is where I've placed this menu and that's how this Genesys theme is designed where

107
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,930
that you can place anything you like up there including a search bar or really anything else that fits

108
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,960
So there's a custom menu that I've made and labeled Hetter menu there.

109
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,620
The home sections if you explore them you can see that I've used text widgets and certain little pieces

110
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,010
And here is the size of the regular text inside of a text widget right there.

111
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,020
You can explore these places a little bit.

112
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,110
It's all about the same end of each.

113
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,310
green orange and pink option.

114
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,290
And if I just choose blue and roll over you can see that that would be the blue as well as in the footer.

115
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:34,850
These actually stay red inside of the social icons widget.

116
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,650
The last thing we'll look at is the breadcrumbs feature there.

117
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,600
Breadcrumbs means it's really a a way to get back to where you were and a way for the Web site to tell

118
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,660
So if I say I want breadcrumbs on pages and I might be able to just just take a look here's a sample

119
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,450
page.

120
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,430
We click back home that's kickable to the home page and I can enable breadcrumbs on pages and maybe

121
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,820
you can see that when you do open the appearance customize window it opens up a modal window in front

122
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:37,510
And so when I close the customize or I'm back to my profile page if I go back to the site that I have

123
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,860
Great.

124
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,550
In this video you started to customize the parallax pro theme from Studio press built on the Genesis

125
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,780
page changed the accent color and added breadcrumbs to help with navigation.

126
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,410
In the next video we'll continue to modify the parallax pro theme within the student's sandbox and look
