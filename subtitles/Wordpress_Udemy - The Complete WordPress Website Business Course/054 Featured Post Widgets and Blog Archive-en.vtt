00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.220
In this video you'll populate your executive pro-se in the student's sandbox with real images and rearrange

2
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.220
We'll explore the post offset system used in the Genesis framework and create a blog archive page to

3
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.130
By the end of this lesson you'll understand how Genesis uses featured post widgets to make changing

4
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:40.130
The appearance customize or and as we look at and open this what I'd like to do is make some changes

5
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.840
to arrange it slightly differently.

6
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.520
Let's make it so that in the featured slider at the top we use three featured pages that are static

7
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:14.220
to arrange the first three inside widget home top to be the latest three posts in the blog.

8
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.840
And then down in the home middle widget area we want posts 4 5 and 6 in reverse order to be placed in

9
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.510
We're going to be using Genesys featured posts widgets and making them so that they are offset correctly

10
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.750
so that when one of the site owners creates a NEW BLOG POST IT places itself in this spot.

11
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.970
And the final post comes off of this 6th area into the Post's archive page.

12
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.010
We'll also be creating a special page that will display an archive of blog posts so readers can go through

13
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.080
and look at all the blog posts in reverse order.

14
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.520
All in one page.

15
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.170
Let's start by populating some of the blog posts inside of Wordpress with actual images instead of these

16
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.560
here.

17
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.020
We have a sticky post and then the rest of the posts that came in with our content import and if we

18
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.990
Notice that it has no featured image so we're going to be bringing in some actual images that we can

19
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.860
Let's make under visibility here under the published tab on the right hand side of the editing screen.

20
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.430
Let's just undo this stickiness.

21
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.950
We don't need to stick it to the top of the page inside of the blog area.

22
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.420
We'll just use 6 posts and populate them with featured images and what you want to do is navigate to

23
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.560
my local development environment.

24
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.630
In the C colon under the map folder and in H.T. docs you know that all our local environment WordPress

25
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.790
called Live site.

26
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.270
We keep images in the media library inside WP content and the uploads folder as you remember.

27
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.540
And I know that under the date 2011 from that file that we imported from WordPress dot org had a folder

28
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.270
If you look at the details of any of the images the first one of its kind in the list of images you

29
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.270
At least six of them are 6900 by twelve hundred and I've taken each one of those.

30
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.480
are that size and I drag them over into a folder on my desktop.

31
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.520
My executive pro folder and I created a folder called images.

32
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.860
Go ahead and do the same.

33
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.110
are a good file size.

34
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.240
So I could bring each of these images into my wordpress installation and then we'll use it to populate

35
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.260
Go ahead and pause the video now choose 6 images of your own either in the same way that I've done or

36
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.250
wide or so.

37
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.160
And then upload them into the media library and choose one for each of six of the posts inside the Wordpress

38
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.940
I hope you did well with that little challenge.

39
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.070
You can click Set featured image and then upload each one individually to the media library.

40
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:31.160
to add all six of those posts at one time so I'm opening up that images folder and select them all and

41
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.850
Then I can go into each post and I can choose each one from the existing media library as their featured

42
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.040
and then clicked update up here.

43
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.400
Let's use these three images inside of the studio press executive demo and this is just a good way to

44
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.750
if you're moving a Web site from one place to another or something like that.

45
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.480
If I right click on this image and then click view image you can see that it's a certain dimensions.

46
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.730
And actually if you go back inside of the Wordpress dashboard and look under Gen. slider settings we've

47
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.740
You don't have to crop them to a specific size but if you want to be sure that the content that you

48
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.560
For example the woman's face if this were a taller image she may have her forehead cut off or it might

49
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.900
So these images are actually facts.

50
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:06.960
Inspect the image info these images are actually a particular size 11:40 by 4:45 the exact size for

51
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.840
So go ahead and right click each of those images and view it and then right click and save the image

52
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.430
to your computer OK or save those images into my downloads folder.

53
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.930
And now I'm just going to bring them across into that same executive pro images folder that I have on

54
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.770
Here's a little challenge for you.

55
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.580
of content and then down here we're going to include by post ID.

56
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:54.300
Let's include three pages and your challenge is to go find three pages that exist inside our imported

57
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.790
We'll choose three of them and then we'll save the settings to our slider

58
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:13.580
have that go if you remember under pages all pages and then if we navigate to any of the pages that

59
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:25.010
I'll go to page two of my pages list and I want to put three of the pages we've been using on the home

60
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.940
So telecommunications is one.

61
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.730
This is post 3:21.

62
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.490
So I'll take note of that.

63
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:54.960
I'm also going to set the featured image and upload while I have it open featured one upload that to

64
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.420
Maybe you did that at the same time as well.

65
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.200
So this is page number 12:57 or post ID 3 to 1.

66
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.290
So I might just take note.

67
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.820
Write that down on a little piece of paper on my desk.

68
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:18.410
I need three to one and I'll pause the video here while I do that for two other pages.

69
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.820
Now I have three pages which have featured images and I've taken note of their post IDs.

70
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.440
So the last step is to go back into the Genesis slider settings.

71
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:38.420
Note that I didn't save this I have to change it to page and I'm going to include these three post ID's

72
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.020
separated by commas.

73
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:47.630
So it's 3 to 1 2 1 9 and 2 2 7 I'll hit save settings.

74
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:58.340
Now if I refresh that I should get some nice images inside of yes inside of my slider.

75
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:06.610
There's one there's another on the design page and in the development page looks great.

76
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.100
widgets inside of Genesis.

77
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:25.990
So back in the Wordpress dashboard I mean open appearance customize and we use the customize or to take

78
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.470
a look at our results as we go.

79
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.290
And I'm going to be editing the widgets.

80
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.440
But instead I'd like to use featured posts instead.

81
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.980
So I'm just going to remove each of these

82
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.170
by opening them up and clicking the remove link at the bottom of each widget.

83
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:06.820
And in terms of featured posts all I need is one widget and I need to just set its settings so that

84
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:13.030
I'm using three posts and I want to use the latest three posts.

85
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.960
I'll order them by date and I'll do a few other settings.

86
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.320
alignment.

87
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:42.640
And let's see I can I do want to show the post title and I will show a content limit of 150 characters

88
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.840
and there is some read more texts.

89
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.740
And that's all I want.

90
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:04.230
and you may have noticed I'm encountering a problem here the way that these widgets are set up is if

91
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.780
But if you have one widget it shows its content in a vertical orientation instead.

92
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.430
And we don't want that we want them to be displayed going across the page.

93
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.560
So how can I do that.

94
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:26.910
I can still use the featured post widgets but instead of having three in one widget I just want to have

95
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.090
the next post for the third one.

96
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:43.530
So I'll just change that by opening up feature posts and I'm just going to show one post in this first

97
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.460
widget and everything else can remain the same so close that.

98
00:12:52.780 --> 00:13:00.490
And this is where it gets a little bit interesting with counting how many posts you'd like to offset.

99
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.310
So I'll show one post here in this widget but I want to offset it one post so that it counts down to

100
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:16.000
So again I'll show the featured image in the featured size and I want to show the content limit again

101
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:26.360
with 150 characters and I'll close that one and I'll repeat that with a third featured post widget.

102
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.250
I'll click add widget feature posts.

103
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:35.080
Again I want to show one posts at this time and get to offset two posts.

104
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.740
I also need to make all my other settings the same.

105
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.920
Show the post title.

106
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:53.110
Remember I haven't saved any of this yet so I can keep opening and closing.

107
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.300
I've got a title for each one.

108
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.970
this upper and lower case and a little larger and have that above the featured image I can change that

109
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:24.160
However now that these are going to be automatically changing as the owners of the Web site add new

110
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.960
is or which post is in which location.

111
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:43.200
So I just need to save and publish in the Customize her and I've got my top three most recent posts

112
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.850
Now in the home middle area.

113
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.660
Let's go back.

114
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.520
I want to edit the home middle area.

115
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:09.090
haven't already and then now down in the home middle widget area your challenge is to offset 3 4 and

116
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.130
owner of the website adds new posts.

117
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.940
I hope that went well for you.

118
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:32.930
Now you should have a series of three of the most recent posts across the home widget top and then the

119
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.160
Home widget middle.

120
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:43.990
Finally let's create a blog archive page provided to us by Gen..

121
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.210
Now back in the Wordpress dashboard I've got pages all pages open and I'm going to click add new Basically

122
00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.410
use instead of the default template we use the blog template provided within the Genesis framework and

123
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.090
just publish that page as a blank content page.

124
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:18.870
Now that we have that saved as a blog template we can use this you are ill or have that page inside

125
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.210
And what we'll get is an automatic blog listing page.

126
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.160
new page called blog.

127
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.530
I'll add it to the menu.

128
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.150
Place it right at the end there and hit save menu.

129
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.260
It's as simple as that.

130
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:55.280
I've got blague up here and when we navigate to that page it shows our posts in reverse order.

131
00:16:55.290 --> 00:17:00.040
Now let's just edit our settings just a little bit to finish with this lesson.

132
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:08.620
If we go into Genesys theme settings you'll be able to control how your blog page and archive pages.

133
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.380
The blog page template control how it's displayed.

134
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.910
So do we want to display all categories.

135
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.350
Do we want to exclude any categories from that blog listing.

136
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.670
And how many posts do we want on that blog page.

137
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:27.020
In addition to that we can show how we want content archives like the blog page to display.

138
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:35.560
Let's display the entry excerpts instead of the entry content and let's display the featured image and

139
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.480
let's display.

140
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.840
Let's see.

141
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:45.390
I think we should display it in a large size and let's just have no alignment it will place it centered

142
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:52.510
And if I click save settings and I'll go back to the blog page and refresh it.

143
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.460
And that's probably made it look a lot better.

144
00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:01.610
In this lesson I've changed the home page content of the site completely but stayed within the Leya

145
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.320
provided by the theme.

146
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:10.180
You used the Genesis featured post widgets and post offset to set up a self updating system for posts

147
00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.780
Use real images and created a blog archive page as well.

148
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.800
form 7 plugin
