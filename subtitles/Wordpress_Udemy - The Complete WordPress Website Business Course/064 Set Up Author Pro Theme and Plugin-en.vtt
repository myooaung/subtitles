00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.050
In this video we'll start with a new site in the student's sandbox activating the author pro theme and

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.530
plug in and importing content using the demo SML file.

3
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.640
and custom fields.

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.930
You need to have them activated before importing the content.

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.150
By the end of this video you'll have your new sandbox site ready to explore the different display features

6
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.330
Let's get started.

7
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.050
Let's start by logging into the student sandbox at W.P. of course dot com.

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.700
If you're not already I'm at students W.P. of course dot com as usual and I click the log in button

9
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.180
and use my any of my my username and password.

10
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.940
Now when it opens up again I'll just make note that I'm logged into my primary site which is the last

11
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.310
sites.

12
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.330
pro theme.

13
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.720
So use a name that's your name author or something else like that.

14
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.230
Pause the video and be right back right.

15
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.720
I chose your name author dot dot dot of course dot com for my site name and I named it author pro CBT.

16
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.260
CBT in wordpress speak stands for custom post types and so the first thing I'm going to do is open up

17
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.480
That means anytime I log in to W.P. of course dotcom it will open the author pro site that I'm working

18
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.080
You've done this before so I'm going to issue it as a challenge where you can pause the video give it

19
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.260
But there's three things I'd like you to do in this challenge.

20
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.150
First though under appearance themes and activate the author pro theme from Genesis and studio press.

21
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:20.520
Secondly click the plug ins button and activate the author pro plugin and then thirdly inside of your

22
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:31.980
Demo files download in the theme SML demo content folder download and import the author pro theme SML

23
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.970
file and import it into your site puzzle video.

24
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.820
Well how'd you do with that.

25
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.220
First I'm going to roll over.

26
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.160
And of course we've got a lot of different themes in here.

27
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.620
Author pro though is near the top because it starts with the letter A and I'm just going to click activate

28
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.590
just below because it's a child theme of Genesis.

29
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.400
present Genesis child themes within our WordPress installation.

30
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.980
Secondly I'm going to open up plug ins and now as I scroll down and look at what's activated nothing

31
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.230
activate plug in activated.

32
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.090
Great.

33
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.010
Now when I had downloaded the themed demo files using this link at the top of my wordpress dashboard

34
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.690
I created a folder on my desktop.

35
00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.020
And so inside of my Windows Explorer I'm going to go inside of that demo content files folder open up

36
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.490
theme XML files and I can see that author pro is right there.

37
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.470
Now that I know where it is you should have been able to find under Tools the import button.

38
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.170
Now we're going to be using the word press importer.

39
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.380
So by clicking that button we're activating that and I'm going to click Browse and go to my desktop

40
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.300
Demo continent files thematics XML files and author pro and click open.

41
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.640
Now once I have that file the author Dasch pro dot ex-MIL file here browsed from the Wordpress dashboard

42
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.720
import the best route is to click your own username for any of the content that's going to come in via

43
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.200
the import and you do want to click download and import file attachments so that that box is checked

44
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.850
and you get the images and everything coming in with the import.

45
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.550
Click submit and you should have seen this.

46
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.430
All done have fun and we didn't import any users so we don't have to update the passwords and the roles

47
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.930
of those users because all of the information in posts and different pages that came in with the import

48
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.900
will be assigned to me as a user.

49
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.960
Lastly we can just make sure that everything came in properly.

50
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.510
We can check the media library and in addition to the 30 images that come inside of new student sites

51
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.940
there's also a group of images starting here and down to the end.

52
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:54.960
These are all images that come in with the author pro import So that looks good and I also can see that

53
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.550
as an archive settings page so that looks good.

54
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.560
Great books with authors tags and book series that's great.

55
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.480
look at the differences between the author pro custom post types plug in and custom press the generic

56
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.100
You set up a new say in your students sandbox and activated the author pro theme and plugin.

57
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.020
Plus you imported the author pro demo content and hopefully you are able to do it on your own before

58
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.690
watching how I did it in this video in the next lesson.

59
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.340
Will take a look at all the specific content display methods for its custom post types that the author

60
00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.560
See there
