00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.770
In this video you'll design the author pro theme home page with content and special widgets using the

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.740
You'll create the home page using some static content and some conditional widgets one which is a special

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.650
featured book widget that comes with the author pro plugin by the end of this video you'll have a complete

4
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.580
First let's get started by gathering all the tools we need to get started customizing the home page

5
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
for this author pro site that we're building right here.

6
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.170
First of all I do have my rolling over author pro or the name of my site here and right clicking on

7
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.250
That's what I have right here with our original parallax pro widgets configured inside of some of the

8
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.000
widget areas for the home page here as well as the footer.

9
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.630
We're going to be changing these over and making this home page of the author pro site look like the

10
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:12.810
So I also have the demo site opened from Studio press demo dot studio press dot com slash author.

11
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.250
each of these pieces of the site contains in terms of their home page widgets.

12
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.240
Now there's a couple of more tools you'll want to have open before I set you loose trying to configure

13
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.680
the home page of author pro on your own as a challenge for this video.

14
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.050
First of all inside of the dashboard you'll remember downloading the theme demo files and if I open

15
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.110
there's two items that we want to have open.

16
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.020
And I've got it open right here that shows me that depending on how many widgets I have in each widget

17
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.160
Secondly I've got an image which I've included in the theme demo files which is an image that labels

18
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.440
each of the five different sections of the front page an author pro you can find that if I open up windows

19
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.380
And I got this from the studio press theme setup page which you have access to.

20
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.410
Once you're a studio press member and you own one of their themes and Gen. but I provided you this image

21
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.760
can see what the different sections are.

22
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.220
Let's go through each of these sections and I'll explain how the demo is set up.

23
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.080
And then you can make an attempt at setting your site up the same way.

24
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.100
First of all back in the Wordpress dashboard lets open appearance widgets and let's just take a look

25
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.010
Now this is a featured book widget.

26
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.830
It's very similar to the Genesis featured page widget but it has to do with the custom post type for

27
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.020
books which over here under library as all of our custom post type information.

28
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.860
So if we open up front page one and just pull a featured book widget over into that area it will open

29
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.760
There's a title you can choose which book among all of your custom post type items under books that

30
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.480
Here's where you can see that the author pro Plug-In provide some different thumbnail sizes when you

31
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:17.110
It creates a 360 by 570 pixel image which is the book cover image and it also creates an 800 by 800

32
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.170
pixel image which you can see is a square image for featured images within the Web site.

33
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.050
These are the smaller thumbnail images for the book.

34
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.860
And here's an 800 by 800 square image and you can see that this one is floated to the right.

35
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.930
In this one's floated to the left.

36
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.190
And then finally here's one floated to the left in the bottom.

37
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.630
Author widget back to the dashboard.

38
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.950
This author pro home page is designed to display featured images either left or right and to use those

39
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.540
square featured content image thumbnails that the plugin creates for us.

40
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.430
You can also choose whether to show the featured text with the image which is that as you'll remember

41
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.620
is the red over here Award-Winning banner whatever you place there is that feature text and then back

42
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.090
Once again you can choose whether to show the book title the show the book author and how much of the

43
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:39.970
to show the price and whether to show the button and what you want to say.

44
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.610
Let's see if I look at my image that has it labeled from page 2 has 4 of these featured book widgets

45
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.570
across.

46
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.070
the page in one row of four.

47
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.250
And that's what the author pro front page is designed to do.

48
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:14.220
So back in the dashboard we can see that there's From page one and then the menu the secondary menu

49
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.980
be visible along with the primary menu as well.

50
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.440
Down here we've got a featured post which is from the blog posts area of the Web site.

51
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.600
We have three text widgets here that provide some testimonials or book reviews.

52
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.810
And then we've got one more featured page widget and this one has the about the author page indicated

53
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:56.760
Your challenge in this video is to configure the author pro home page to look like the sample or the

54
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.560
One more quick review.

55
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.380
This is agenesis featured page widget.

56
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:16.920
Number two is for Genesis featured book widgets number three is agenesis featured post widget number

57
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.130
testimonial.

58
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.780
And finally front page widget area number five is another Genesys featured page which widget.

59
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.010
Go ahead and customize your own front page in your own students sandbox site Pozza video now and then

60
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.470
Good luck.

61
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.350
OK how do you do I hope you did well with that.

62
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.960
Now I'm back inside of the Wordpress dashboard and I'm in the widgets page still.

63
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:57.700
And in this front page one section where we were looking at the Genesis author probe featured book widget.

64
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.240
I actually don't want that to be there.

65
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:15.420
widgets over here to get rid of them and from page 3 I also have extra widgets that I had inside of

66
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.070
Yes.

67
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.730
I'll pull it out of there.

68
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.270
So I have my front page one two three four and five ready to go.

69
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:34.060
I should also point out that you may if you like open the Customize her and use the widgets area and

70
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.560
I often find there's a little more room to work on the actual appearance widgets editing page without

71
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.950
I really don't need the live preview at the time and I'm going to use the larger widget editing screen

72
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040
in this example.

73
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:03.170
So I've got front page one here and you know the one thing I need to do is remove the cut a custom menu

74
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:15.520
So in front page one I know that I want a Genesys featured page and this is going to be about the author.

75
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:15.960
Let's see.

76
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.490
This is a page called Best selling author.

77
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.830
Really I want this page here.

78
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:31.100
Bestselling author I want to show the featured image and I want to use that featured content size which

79
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.210
This one I think is justified to the right or floated right so I'm going to align that image to the

80
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:50.090
I'm going to show the page title and I'm going to show the page content but only a certain number of

81
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.870
And for my more text I'm just going to put read more and those two little arrows are nice.

82
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:07.180
So I hit save and now I do like to go back and just check out my work as I make a change in each side.

83
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.030
That looks great.

84
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.560
So I could fit a little bit more text if I like it looks like they use less.

85
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:20.090
In the example demo but I'm liking what it looks like and the more button is a nice rollover button

86
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.850
And of course it shows this down below.

87
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.160
images or anything like that.

88
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.750
it full width all the way across.

89
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.810
What I want are for book widgets in that front page to area.

90
00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:02.670
front page to open I'll configure these one at a time so for my first one I'll use this book across

91
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.580
I want to show the featured image and I'm going to use this special size for the book covers called

92
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:14.830
Author pro image for the thumbnail and I'm just going to have no image to.

93
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.920
But I do want to show the featured text in case there's a blue banner on any one of the book covers.

94
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.590
I want to show the book title and the author but I'm going to show no content.

95
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.140
I don't need to show the price but I'll just leave it as View book.

96
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:40.620
That'll be my nice button so people can click through to the book by clicking the button clicking the

97
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.020
So if I hit save here I can take a look at what I've got.

98
00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:02.730
and so will do is create three more featured book widgets here plus a video and once I've created them

99
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.500
I'll start it up and will take a look.

100
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.640
OK now I've got all four featured book widgets created.

101
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:16.660
This is my last one you can see that I've got all the same items checked with no content and so I can

102
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:27.070
You can see here it is from the top there's my featured page my navigation right here and then I've

103
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.460
There's an author page link here because I chose to show the author's name and then you can see my featured

104
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:50.510
If I click the page itself you can see that my single book pages look good and they have all the appropriate

105
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.600
I go back to the home page.

106
00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.570
My next step is going to be at next front page area.

107
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.370
Front page number 3.

108
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.060
So back here in widgets I can close front page to now in front page 3.

109
00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:22.130
featured pages and featured book page in that you can have it be a conditional widget that shows posts

110
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:30.620
However many of the latest posts and how many you want to offset And so if we just want to show the

111
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:37.910
latest post in all of the categories we can choose a few different items here we want to show the featured

112
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:45.290
Again we want to do that special thumbnail size of featured content and let's align this one to the

113
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:57.740
let's show a standard excerpt this time and read more that looks fine.

114
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.650
my other.

115
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.600
Refresh the page over in my other tab.

116
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.420
All right I've got the latest post is Hello world.

117
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.710
I actually don't want that one.

118
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.660
I look under posts all posts I want.

119
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:29.690
The behind Iceland Easts to be the latest POSSO this hello world that came with my new WordPress installation

120
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.390
post.

121
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.120
Great.

122
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.230
And now this has a featured image.

123
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.410
But if I click it or click the title you can see that the featured image in this author pro-team doesn't

124
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.220
Just as a featured image on archive pages and the front page.

125
00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:01.040
So if you wanted a an image inside of the content you'd place it in here manually under posts behind

126
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:01.750
Iceland.

127
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:07.350
It's back here and hit back again and will go to the home page.

128
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:14.410
Now there's two more areas I want to fill in so I'll go back to my appearance widgets editing screen

129
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.220
and let's see that was front page 3 in front page 4.

130
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.990
I've got three text widgets now.

131
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:29.650
Again if I open up my layout document if I do 3 they're going to come across in a nice grid and I use

132
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:44.560
If I go back into front page 4 in the widget area I'm going to drag text widgets across and really I'm

133
00:15:54.210 --> 00:16:03.130
I'll just label these very quickly and I'll just grab some lips and text here.

134
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.270
Lauren ipsum.

135
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.060
So I have some kind of sample text to go in there.

136
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:18.100
You may have spent a little bit more time but you didn't have to.

137
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.950
I was going to go get a little text just for the content area.

138
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:40.170
it to save that learning that I've got with it three

139
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:53.950
but that same content in there and hit save OK great I'll go back into the home page and take a look.

140
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.940
Two and Three are showing Where's widget one

141
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:10.950
there's three there's two which one I might not have hit save.

142
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.490
There we go.

143
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:13.920
I'll close.

144
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.450
And finally in front page five.

145
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.410
Let's bring in another Genesys featured page and this one is the about the author page.

146
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.620
I want this image to go to the left.

147
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.770
Sure show the page title and the content.

148
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:44.370
There's room for about 300 characters and then read more with the two arrows and I'll see if you can

149
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:54.430
Customizing Genesis themes and Genesis theme home pages in this lesson.

150
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:05.610
The layout configuration document and the demo as an example you can see that the author pro plugin

151
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.000
provides us with an easy way of displaying the custom post type it creates.

152
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:18.970
We've been working on by completing the footer widget areas and the after entry widget area that many

153
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.240
Let's get to it.
