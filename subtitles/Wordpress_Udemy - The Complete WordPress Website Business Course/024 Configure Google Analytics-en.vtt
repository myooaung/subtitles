00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.080
Google Analytics is a free service that provides the best Web site visitor tracking you just need to

2
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.180
You'll set up a Google Analytics account if you don't have one already and connected to your brochure

3
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.730
dashboard is easy to do through a plugin and it keeps the tracking code separate from the theme files

4
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.120
allowing you to change or upgrade themes without affecting the tracking depending on the client.

5
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.360
You may want to encourage them to get their own Google Analytics account and then pass the credentials

6
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.760
If you don't think they need more than just the Wordpress dashboard stats or wouldn't log in to use

7
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.920
I'll demonstrate how to sign up for an account of your own and connected to the wordpress site.

8
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.340
Now I'm already signed into a Google dot com account that I set up for this purpose and logged in already.

9
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.210
As you can see here at the top right if you click the Google Apps icon you can open up a few options

10
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.610
but then you must click them more.

11
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.510
And then it's not even here to get to analytics.

12
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.070
You need to click even more from Google and that'll give you everything that they make it down here

13
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.480
You can also just type analytics dot Google dot com

14
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.840
when you're logged in.

15
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.800
If you already have an analytics account it'll take you to your dashboard page.

16
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.400
But since we're starting from scratch I'm going to have to use this G-mail and Google account to sign

17
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.720
Now I can start in with the setup up.

18
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.410
All I need to do is go through the selection process here with a new account.

19
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.780
I'm going to track a Web site and I'm going to choose a name for it

20
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.040
which is the name of the Web site that I'm creating

21
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.470
now it is at a certain

22
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.460
u r l but since we're developing this site locally I don't have a live your for it yet.

23
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.230
I'm just going to put that in for now.

24
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.070
And let's go ahead and put the actual Your L in here.

25
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.910
Go ahead and put in my time zone.

26
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.560
I can basically leave all the settings at their defaults and click get a tracking ID.

27
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.730
I do need to accept the terms

28
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.070
and then Google Analytics will open up my dashboard page Great.

29
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.580
Now a tracking ID that starts with a UK dash is something that you can use in most plug ins to go ahead

30
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.420
and set up your Google Analytics tracking.

31
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.100
You can also track manually on any Web site or place a tracking script in the header of of a web site

32
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.770
Some themes give you a place where you can put scripts like this into the header or footer of the Web

33
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.810
For us we're going to set up a plug in that while we're logged into Google we can give permission to

34
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.850
Now that we've got Google Analytics set up lets go back to our brochure site dashboard and look at our

35
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.560
Click here to open up an authentication window with Google

36
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.920
Google Analytics Peter would like to view and manage the data control C for copy

37
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.760
copy that wants save and continue

38
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.330
create it cease fire with photography as the one property in Google.

39
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.740
Google Analytics Ihit save.

40
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:08.140
And then once I enable that I'll be able to see some stats on the Wordpress dashboard.

41
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.830
Now if there were any traffic coming into this Web site and it wasn't hosted locally but it was live

42
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.180
or my client.

43
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.750
Let's go ahead and look at a second option that we might use by hitting plug ins and new.

44
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:39.970
Just do a quick search for Google Analytics and you can see right next to Google Analytics later is

45
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.460
More than a million active installs.

46
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.870
one out.

47
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.680
Just click Install now.

48
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.880
Click activate the plug in.

49
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.050
And now I've already got an insights menu item over here.

50
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.410
I'll take a look at the dashboard it is giving me a little warning message in Red please configure your

51
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.720
That's great.

52
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.990
And let's go ahead and click Settings.

53
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.580
Great.

54
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.030
with my Google account and it should pull the right code in here.

55
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:40.170
It opened a window and says that yes I'd like to allow Google Analytics to connect gives me an indication

56
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.180
paste that right here into the Wordpress plug in

57
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.840
great.

58
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.460
Now I can click Save changes

59
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.350
and what I'll do is select the one profile for the Web site that I had set up in Google Analytics because

60
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.460
I think that's it.

61
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.030
Now if there was traffic coming to this Web site and it was live on the internet we could go to the

62
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.070
from Google Analytics.

63
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.580
Don't forget you don't want to have to Google Analytics plug ins set up at the same time.

64
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:47.790
And so just as I did before with Google Maps I'm going to look at my installed plug ins and go ahead

65
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.850
and deactivate the Google Analytics later plug in and delete that from the Web site to keep the installation

66
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.120
nice and clean.

67
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.290
There we go.

68
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:08.060
In this lesson you've logged into Google Analytics and set up a new property for the brochure site and

69
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:21.020
Google and you've seen where the traffic stats and reports can be seen within WordPress in the next

70
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:27.830
We'll revise our brochure site and change the home page from a static page to a dynamic blog style home

71
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.580
See you there.
