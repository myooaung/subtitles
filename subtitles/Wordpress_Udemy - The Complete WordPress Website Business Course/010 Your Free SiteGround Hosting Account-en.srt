7
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,580
different places that we will use in this course.

8
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,060
If you scroll down near the top click the site Ground link and it will open up a new tab where there's

9
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,920
a three months free hosting sign up page and you can just click sign up right there.

12
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,190
So this is a special exclusive offer for students of the course and just go down and the last choice

13
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,480
If you do own a domain name that you'd like to use with this hosting account during the course you can

14
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,780
activate it with an existing domain you could purchase a domain name right here if you like but I don't

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,870
And it's easy enough to activate an account without the domain and you'll be given a free domain to

16
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,700
The hosting account for.

17
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:17,740
So just click the box that you've confirmed and click pay now which will be zero dollars.

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,380
And let site ground set up your hosting account for you.

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,780
log into the customer area right here to log in to your site.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,110
You are ELF from site ground it's you a for user area dot site Ground dot com and that's what I've done

21
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,520
You can see that I've received an email from site Ground Kinglet your and you are now a sacred client

22
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,830
and they've assigned me a username and the password is the one that I chose during the sign up process.

23
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,150
So make sure you remember that password that you used and use your username that they've assigned you

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:20,880
Control-C to copy and I'll go back to the log in form and I'll go ahead and log in with my username

25
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,360
And now I get to choose whether I want to start a Web site transfer an existing web site or thanks but

26
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,380
It's important that you choose this third option because we are going to be installing WordPress using

27
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,920
So now that you've chosen the third option thanks but I don't need help.

28
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,280
Click proceed.

29
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,370
This is the site Ground user area and whenever I log in to site Ground I'll usually go right to the

30
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:15,710
I have a primary domain here which is Greg one dot SAGD you dot site and we can use this domain throughout

31
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,860
the course to build web sites and do all of our coursework.

32
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,840
And there's some other information that you can look at as you go down here.

33
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:30,120
These are your name servers if you do own a domain name and you'd like to point a domain at your site

34
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,400
But we don't have to do that during the course next let's click the red button go to see panel and see

35
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,860
button checked.

36
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,600
And then remember your selection and click proceed once the see panel is loaded.

37
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,510
You can explore by scrolling down a little bit all the different utilities that we have as a part of

38
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,410
Let's finish up this video by installing Wordpress and activating it for our testing domain whatever

39
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,320
So if you see near the top there's an auto installer section and you can just click the word press button.

40
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:30,470
companies accounts and you can just go to the install tab and let's choose where to install WordPress

41
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,800
inside of our domain right here.

42
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:42,470
Now we'll leave HTP colon slash slash for now as opposed to setting it up under a secure HTP s which

43
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,350
a separate directory here in the directory place.

44
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:59,390
We could just leave everything else as the default except what I'm going to do is choose a username

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,070
that's easy for me to remember along with a password that I can remember as well.

46
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:14,600
So I'll just choose that user password that I can remember and I use a valid email address so that I

47
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,310
there.

48
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,540
We can just choose whatever we need down here.

49
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:32,020
Let's just leave all of the defaults and we can go down and click install should only take a couple

50
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,820
That just took about five or 10 seconds and it says congratulations the software was installed successfully

51
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:52,290
and it gives me a U R L which is my regular site Ground educational site you Arel that I'm using along

52
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,430
account slash W.P. Dasch admin.

53
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,740
We don't have to save or remember that we're going to be using this u r l a lot in different places

54
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,090
in this course.

55
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,720
you back to the seat panel.

56
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,870
We don't really need to go back there again because we're going to be managing WordPress through its

57
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,310
admin you are l.

58
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,530
But let's go ahead and open up a new tab in your browser.

59
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,720
And let's go to the you are l where are your wordpress site is set up.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,090
If you're in the C panel that's at the very top here and I'm just going to hit Control C and it's also

61
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:52,050
I don't want to open up my new tab and just paste that you URL right into the address bar.

62
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,270
And I've got a new WordPress site set up.

63
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,060
This is a default page.

64
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,550
That site ground creates for you with a little bit of links to some resources.

65
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:09,490
And if we want to get to the admin page we can go to this log in button right here in the sidebar and

66
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,710
I'm going to right click that and click Open link in new tab.

67
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:21,190
That way I'll have the log in an admin area open at the same time as I have the actual site open in

68
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:32,920
Remember I used a certain username right there and typed my password that I made sure and remembered

69
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,430
and I'll click log in and I can ask Firefox to remember that password for me so it's easy for me to

70
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,750
Here's my wordpress dashboard.

71
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,510
And boy doesn't that feel great.

72
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,990
There's nothing like getting a nice fresh WordPress installation installed and ready to go on your news

73
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,320
Remember it's my you Arel here that I'm using with my site Ground free account.

74
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,930
WP admin is where my web site lives.

75
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:21,180
We can use this site Ground account to create multiple WordPress environments for all of our course

76
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:30,670
Lastly lets configure the Wordpress dashboard and our WordPress installation just a little bit from

77
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:39,760
That site ground gives us first off there is a welcome to WordPress area right here that you can dismiss

78
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:46,660
up here on the right hand side if you like and we've got a default plugin from automatic.

79
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,010
For now I'm just going to go into plugins installed plugins and take a look at our plugins lists that

80
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,690
I'm just going to deactivate jetpack for now and we'll leave the other to default WordPress plugins

81
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,280
deactivated as well.

82
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:24,490
line and I'm also going to choose my own time zone as well as the what I want the week to start on and

83
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,080
So go ahead and do that and I'll pause the video and be right back.

84
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:38,050
I changed my site title to site ground testing site made a tagline experimentation for WP dev course

85
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,920
and then I just wanted to show you as you go down here to time zone if you open it up you can get a

86
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,940
But there's also a number of different cities here.

87
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,430
But if you just start typing a letter you can go to a city that's near you.

88
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,870
Then I'll click Save changes usually get a green line when your settings are saved.

89
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,220
Like I just did and then the second and third thing I always do is I'll go down to the media settings

90
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,820
and I like to uncheck the organize my uploads into month and year based folders just so I keep all of

91
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,430
I want to.

92
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,540
So I save those changes and then finally I always go into Permalink.

93
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,620
And I'll choose post name.

94
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,840
The best permalink structure for MCO for the search engine optimization and it's the simplest gives

95
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,370
Then I'll just go down and click save changes once again.

96
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:59,800
And now I have a fresh WordPress installation that's ready to go and I can start building sites in the

97
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,060
We'll set up a free managed hosting account at flywheel.

98
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,470
One of the fastest and most secure managed WordPress hosts available.

99
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,070
Let's go
