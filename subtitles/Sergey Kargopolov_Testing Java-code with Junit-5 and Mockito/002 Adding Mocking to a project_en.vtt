00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.410
To use the Makita in our unit tests, we will need to add it to our project.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.620
And in this lesson, I'll show you a where to find my keep that your files as well as my even greater

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.210
dependency on it.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.560
So to find my kids dependencies, I will open a new browser window and I will go to maven repository

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.070
dot com.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.120
And here I will search for my Kita.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.550
There is one dependency that i want to end at this moment and it is called my kitty g unit.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.310
Jupyter So using this search bar and the tool I will search for my key to G-Unit, Jupiter and the very

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.530
first item in the search result is what I'm looking for Mikita and G-Unit to be there.

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.640
So I will connect.

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.130
I will click on the latest version.

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.700
And if your project is a regular channel project that does not use me or Gradle, then you can download

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.460
my key to your files by clicking on this link.

14
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.780
Here it says Jar next to files and this will download my Keep a Jar file which you can then add as a

15
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.310
library to your project.

16
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.840
If your project is gradle based, then a little bit below here we have a panel and the second top from

17
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.790
the left is Gradle.

18
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.780
So you will create this gradle dependency and will add it to a built to gradle file in your gradle based

19
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.200
project.

20
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.710
The project that I will use for this demonstration is E1 based, so I will click on the Maven top and

21
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.290
will copied the menu and dependency.

22
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.580
I will copy exemple code snippet and we'll go back to my project.

23
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.660
And for this demonstration I'm going to use this same user service project that we have created earlier.

24
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:52.000
So I will open its demo file and we'll paste my key the dependency into Add dependencies, section A

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.300
right and the top before tuning unit dependency like this.

26
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.330
And now because I have funded the new dependency, I will need to click on this button in the top right

27
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.889
corner to load maven changes or I can do right mouse click on the project for example, and then scroll

28
00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:19.020
all the way down select maven and click on Reload Project and this will make Maven download my key libraries

29
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.970
and add them to my project.

30
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.060
All right, so we have added my kit to our project.

31
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.170
Let's continue.
