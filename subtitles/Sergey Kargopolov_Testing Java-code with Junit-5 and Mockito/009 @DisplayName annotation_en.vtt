00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.210
In this lesson you will learn how to use displaying annotation that is also very helpful in making your

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.960
test names easy to understand and also less technical.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.920
Let's run our test methods and see how they look.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.250
So I'll scroll up and I will run all test methods in their class.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.090
So here's the test report and we see that the class name is called Calculator a test.

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.760
And then we see a name of each test method.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.390
And the name of the test method appears in the test report exactly as we have named it in the test class.

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.100
And it looks very technical.

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.180
So if needed, we can make this test method names and also the name of the test class look less technical

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.110
in the test report.

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.380
And to do that we use this name annotation.

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.660
So let's see how it works.

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.470
I will add this plane name above the class name first.

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.390
And in double quotes, I'll provide a name that I want to see in the report.

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.980
For example, this month Aberrations in Calculator Class.

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.020
So now if I run test medicine this class, I should see test math operations in calculator class instead

17
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.460
of calculator test.

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.140
Okay, so let's add display name above other test methods as well.

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.530
This one, I will call test four divided by two.

20
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.220
For example, this one will be division by zero.

21
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.270
And since this test method is not implement, I will intentionally fail.

22
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.210
And we have integer subtraction.

23
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.280
I will call this test method.

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.020
33.

25
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.610
Takeaway one equals 32.

26
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.270
All right.

27
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.890
So now, instead of very long test names like this one, for example, we should see a shorter and less

28
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.420
technical test names.

29
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.720
Now, let's execute this test methods and see how they look.

30
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.260
And here we go.

31
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.820
The Times report now looks a lot less technical and more friendly.

32
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.030
We can read it and understand what exactly we are doing.

33
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.890
Here is the name of the test class.

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.940
Test my preparations in calculator class and here are display names of each of our test methods.

35
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.640
As you can see with displaying them on station, our test method becomes much more easier to read.

36
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.050
All right, so everything is working well for us, and we're good to continue.
