1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,960
So I have added two more assertions to my test method and these are to check if the last name that the

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,410
user object contains is equal to the last name.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,670
I have used to create this user object and an assertion to validate if the email address is also correct.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,280
Now if I open user class then here I added two more instance variables a last name, an email address,

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,780
updated constructor to initialize this variables and I have added two more get them and to be able to

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,950
retrieve this values.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,270
If I open user service implementation clause, then here I create a new instance of user clause using

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,560
the updated constructor that accepts last name on the email address as well.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,100
All right.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,160
So now I can go back to my user service test class and run this test method to see if it works.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,980
And it successfully passes.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,140
I hope you were also able to complete this exercise successfully and if needed.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,600
You can download source code of this exercise.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,459
I will attach it to this lecture.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,290
All right, so let's continue.
