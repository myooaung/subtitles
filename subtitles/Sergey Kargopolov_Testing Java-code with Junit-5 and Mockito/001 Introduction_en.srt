1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,680
In the following video lessons, we will write test methods that will engage all three layers of our

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,700
application.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,510
So this test methods are going to be integration tests because we will not mock and we will not fake

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,070
any object behavior.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,090
Our test method will perform a CDP request to trigger code in the controller class and a method in the

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:31,860
controller class will invoke code in the service class and our code in the service class will actually

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,820
invoke code in the data layer and our code in the data layer will actually write and read information

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,500
from a database table.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,880
This time we will not disable any security configuration, and this means that to communicate with protected

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,150
API endpoints, our HTTP request will need to include a valid JWT token.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:54,930
All right.

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,100
So let's continue and let's write a few more integration tests.
