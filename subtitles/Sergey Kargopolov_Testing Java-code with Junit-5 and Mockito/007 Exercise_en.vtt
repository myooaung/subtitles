00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.200
Now we have a test method that checks if the CRE that user object contains correct is a first name.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.830
But we also need to verify that this user object also contains correct last name and email address.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.160
So let it be a practice exercise, follow the test, even development, and verify that the return to

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.510
the object also contains correct class name and correct email address.

5
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.840
I would not make the create user method return user object that contains password because password is

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.830
considered sensitive information and we usually do not return password back.

7
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.580
I will also pause recording and I will add two more assertions to this same test method and this will

8
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.090
be an assertion to check that the return to the object contains correct last name, and in other assertion

9
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.240
to check that the returned user object contains correct email address and in the following lesson we

10
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.260
will review the result.
