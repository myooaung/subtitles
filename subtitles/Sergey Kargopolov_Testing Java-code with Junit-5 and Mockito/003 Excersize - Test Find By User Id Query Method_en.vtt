00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.670
Now that we have successfully tested one query method, let's write a new test method to test one more

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.450
query method that we have in our user repository.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.120
And this time try writing this test method on your own.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.640
Let's open user repository for a moment.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.200
So your goal will be to write a test method to test find by user ID query method.

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.140
The test method that you will create will be very similar to a test method that we have created for

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.900
the find by email query method.

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.260
So you will need to make sure that you have at least one user record in the database, but you can also

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.390
have two or three records as well.

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.870
And then in the ACT section of your test method, you will invoke this query method defined by user

11
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
ID, because this is going to be your method on the test.

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.320
And in the third section of your test method you will validate if the returned object contains correct

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.130
user ID.

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.940
I will also work on this same test method and in the following lesson I'll show you how I have implemented

15
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.210
it.

16
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.810
All right.

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:11.400
So post this video course now and as a practice exercise, create a new test method to validate if the

18
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.640
find by user ID query method works.
