00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.130
And this lesson, we're going to create a new test class and you will learn about another very useful

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.010
foundation that is used when writing integration tests.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.370
So let's create a new test class.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.930
I will select controls package and inside of the controllers package, I will create a new test class.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.790
That I will call users controller integration test.

6
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.020
Notice that I'm creating this new test class in the test package, not in the main application, but

7
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.460
in the test package.

8
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.430
So users control integration test, enter and to make sprint framework create and run application context

9
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.370
that involves all three layers of our application.

10
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.040
I'll annotate my test class with annotation that is called Sprint Boot Test.

11
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.130
So this Springwood test annotation, it will tell Springwood to look for main application class, the

12
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.310
one that is annotated with Springwood application and the one that has public static void main.

13
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.260
And it will use it to start Sprint application context.

14
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.840
So Sprint Framework will then scan the root package over application and all SAP packages looking for

15
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.040
classes with different annotations.

16
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.600
But this time, because we use spring boot test annotation, spring framework will not stop at the web

17
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.080
layer.

18
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.110
It will create bins that are related to all three layers of my application beans that are related to

19
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.350
web layer, service layer and data layer as well.

20
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.880
And all bins will be created and all bins will be added to Sprint application context.

21
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.530
All right.

22
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.910
And we can also use this springboard test annotation to specify if we want Sprint framework to run web

23
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.620
environment on a specific port number or on a random port number.

24
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.610
So let's see how it works in the following lesson.
