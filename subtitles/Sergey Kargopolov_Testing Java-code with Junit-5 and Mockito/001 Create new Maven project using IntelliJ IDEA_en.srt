00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,160
In the following lessons, you will learn how to set up G unit in a Maven based project.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,290
If you do not use Maven, then feel free to skip this lessons until you need them in the future.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,140
Because in the following lessons I will also show you how to set up G Unit without using Maven.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:16,980
All right.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,680
So in this lesson, I will create a new Maven based project using intelligent development environment.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,860
So to create a new project, I will click on New Project Button here in the top right corner.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,970
Then from the left side panel, I will select Maven and will click on the next button to continue.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,260
Here I will need to give my project a name.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,880
For example Calculator Maven Project.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,420
And using the field below, we can specify location where we want this project to be created.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,620
So our copy of the project name and I will click on the folder button to choose a different location,

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,740
for example, a different folder and click on Open.

13
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,380
Now I will add forward, slash and paste the name of the project.

14
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:15,200
Now I will expand artifact coordinates by clicking on it, and we will need to fill in these fields.

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,100
Now, the very first one is group and group.

16
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,090
These usually reverse the mean name of your company or a project.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,290
I have a project that is called Apps Developer Blog dot com, so a reverse domain name will be called

18
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,620
IBM's Developer BLOCK.

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,620
This.

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,670
The man belongs to me.

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,140
So I know that my project will not clash with others now.

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,590
Next will need to provide a value for artifact ID, which is usually a name of the current project.

23
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,950
So I will keep it as if I'm version of the project.

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,260
I will also keep these and will click on the finish button to create this project.

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,410
And here I have my new project created.

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:06,830
If I expand source folder, then here I have main folder and if I expand here I have a Java folder for

27
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:15,620
my application Java code and below on this same level with main folder, we have this folder with Java

28
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,560
folder as well where we're going to create test classes and we have bookmarks.

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,870
Example file which is currently opened, we will use this file to manage project dependencies.

30
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,590
All right.

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,640
So let's continue.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,640
And in the following lesson will add the needed g.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,430
You need five dependencies to this Java project.
