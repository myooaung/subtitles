00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.410
When we annotate our test class with Springwood test annotation, we can also specify the type of web

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.090
environment that we want to use for our test.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.650
For example, in brackets I can specify where environment equals and then Springwood test.

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.220
Web environment.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.930
MOC So if I explicitly specify a mock web environment, or if I do not specify any web environment,

6
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.230
then by default a mock web environment will be used.

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.040
Now, when a mock web environment is used, then a spring framework will create web application context

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.610
with mocked servlet environment.

9
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.950
And this means that you will not have an entire screen application context loaded and only beans that

10
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.680
are related to web player will be created.

11
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.090
And because this is only a mock servlet environment, spring framework will also not start a real embedded

12
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.170
servlet container.

13
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.190
And to test our weapon points we will need to use more MVC object again as we did it in previous lessons

14
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.930
and mock requests, which is not what we want this time.

15
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.270
This time I want integration test that involves code in all layers of our application.

16
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.660
So if you do not want to use mock servlet environment anymore and you want Sprint framework to actually

17
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.380
start an embedded server on a specific port number or on a random port number, you will need to use

18
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.660
a different web environment here.

19
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.950
So let's continue.

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.160
And in the following lessons we will talk about define port number and random port number options.
