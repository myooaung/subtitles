00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,540
In the following lessons you will learn about test driven development.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,810
And in this section of the course, I will use a new project.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Now you can create your own Java project, or you can use my project that I have created and attached

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,980
to this lecture.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,050
And my project is a Maven based Java project and it does not have any application or test code.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,420
The test folder is empty and the main application java folder is also empty.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,170
It is an empty project, but it does have two unique dependencies.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,670
Inform example file.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,500
So here's the key.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,750
You need Jupyter dependency and it also has the Maven sure fire plugin added.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,810
If you choose to use my project, then post this video as a now download the project that I have attached

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,320
to this lesson and open it in your development environment.

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,860
All right.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,290
So in this lesson, I will create a new test class and a new test method to create a new test class.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:04,080
I will select Java folder in a test directory and inside of Java folder I will create a new class.

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,650
I will call this Java class user service test.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,810
And we'll create a New Testament that I will start with the test, annotation, void test.

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,650
And the very first method that I want to implement and test will be that I can successfully create a

19
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,220
new user.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,600
So create user will be the name of my method and the test.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,800
Now next comes the condition or the stage change.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,460
And here I can see when user details provided.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,500
Then they should indicate what should be the expected result when a user details are provided.

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,820
Then I'm expecting the create user return a user object.

25
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,290
So I will type return user function.

26
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,300
Find this test.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:01,000
Create user minted when using the times provided returns user object and I will set the structure of

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,410
my test method right away.

29
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,190
Arrange, act and assert.

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,990
All right, so we have a new test class and we have a new test method created.

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,460
Now let's continue.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,080
And in the following lecture we will implement the create user method.
