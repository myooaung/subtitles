In previous lessons, you've learned to write test methods for an entity object, and you can use exactly

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
the same approach to test other properties of your user entity.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.690
So let's have a little practice exercise, for example, as a new test method.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.930
Let's test that our database table does not accept duplicate values.

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.580
For user ID, for example, let's open user entity.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.860
Let's have a look at the user ID field.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.300
Now notice that user ID column is configured to be unique, and this means that the value in the user

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.740
ID column in our user's database table must be unique.

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.600
There cannot be any other record in the user's database table that has the same value in user ID column.

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.990
So let's create a test method that validates this.

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.370
And to do that, we will need to persist into a database table, a new user with specific user ID,

12
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.510
and then we'll need to try persisting another user with exactly the same value of user ID.

13
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.410
And in the result, if we try to persist another user with exactly the same user ID, we should get

14
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.720
an exception message because two users with the same user ID cannot exist.

15
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.430
And if exception does take place, then our test method should pass.

16
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.470
Otherwise, if exception does not take place, our test method should fail.

17
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.830
All right, so post this video course and try creating a new test method on your own.

18
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.650
There can be different ways to write this test method and in the following video lesson, also one of

19
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.940
the ways to do it.

20
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.940
All right, so post this video course and try implementing this new test method on your own.

21
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.580
And once done, continue to the next lesson.
