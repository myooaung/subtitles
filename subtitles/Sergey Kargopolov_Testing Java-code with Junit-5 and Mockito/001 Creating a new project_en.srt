00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,770
In the following lessons, you will learn how to set them to unit in Gradle based project.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,380
If you do not use Gradle, then feel free to skip these lessons until you need them in the future.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,900
Because in the following lessons, I will also show you how to set up a unit in your project without

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,150
using Maven or Gradle.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,760
All right, so in this lesson, I'll create a new Gradle based project using intelligent development

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,830
environment to create a new project.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,300
I will click on this new project button that is in the top right corner.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:38,910
And then from the left side panel, I will select Gradle, will select Java, and then click on Next

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,300
Button.

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,700
I will need to give my project a lean.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,240
This time I will call it Calculator and Gradle Project.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,970
And if needed, you can change location for this project by clicking on this folder button.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,550
I will delete the location as is and will expand artifact coordinates by clicking on it.

14
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,810
Here we will need to fill in artifact coordinates that will uniquely identify our project.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,120
And the first one is group I.D..

16
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,160
Group I.D. is usually a reverse domain name of your company or of your project.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,270
For example, I have project that is called obstacle per block dot com.

18
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,520
So a river is the main name for this project will be IBM's developer block.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,640
Because this domain belongs to me.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,570
I know that this project will not conflict with other projects.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,080
All right, so then we'll need to provide artifact I.D., which is usually name of the current project.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,800
And that will keep it, as he's called, Co-leader, Green or Project.

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,640
And a version of this project I will also leave as is.

24
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,360
I will then click on the finish button to create this project.

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,040
We will need to give it a few seconds to finish its setup.

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,370
And now one set up is complete.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,230
We have a new project in the source folder.

28
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:09,850
We have main Java folder for application, Java code and below on the same level with main folder,

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:17,290
we have test folder and in this test folder we have Java folder where we're going to create test classes.

30
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:26,470
And then we have built Gradle file which is currently opened and we will use this file to manage dependencies.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,940
We do not really have to.

32
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,930
You need to find dependencies which are key.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,530
You need to Peter API and change up their engine.

34
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,140
But in the following lesson we will add a different dependency which is going to be an aggregate of

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,830
this tool.
