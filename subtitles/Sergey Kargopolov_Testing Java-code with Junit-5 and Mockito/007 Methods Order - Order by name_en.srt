1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,330
In this lesson, we will configure our test class to order test methods execution by name.

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,990
And for this demonstration, I will create a new class as well.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,560
I'll create a new course and I will call this new first class methods ordered by me.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,220
Now our copy test methods from a previous test class.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,230
And will paste them here.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,090
And to configure, you need to execute methods in this class in a specific order.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,930
I will annotate this class with test method order annotation.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,770
To configure method execution order by mental theme.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,660
I will use method order.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,300
And from the older auctions I will choose method name.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,000
Now with this configuration, two unions will order a method by their name and method arguments.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,950
And to me this demonstration more obvious.

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,370
I intentionally use very simple test method names.

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,160
And what I will also do, I will change the order of this method a little bit.

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:15,900
For example, I will move method, test D and the top and then I will move test C method, be it right

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,820
after test A so that they appear in a random order in my test class.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,540
All right, so let's run methods in this class and see if two units will sort execution order by method

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,870
name.

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,150
I will click on the run button.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:42,260
And we have expected result the very first test method that Iran is test he second is to be test C and

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,340
test D.

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,840
All test methods are sorted by their name.

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,750
All right, so it all worked.

24
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,840
And you now know how to configure G-Unit to order method execution by method name.

25
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,890
Let's continue.
