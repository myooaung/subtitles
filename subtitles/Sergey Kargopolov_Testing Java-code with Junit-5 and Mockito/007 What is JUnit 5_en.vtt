00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.810
So what is going to be the first answer that comes to mind is that it is a testing framework that allows

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.660
us to write unit tests in Java, which is true.

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.640
Let's have a look at its architecture.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.290
G.

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.500
Unit five is a combination of three things.

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.430
It is a combination of G unit platform, Gene and Jupiter API and new unit vintage test engine.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.940
The first component of Gene five is such a unique platform.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.900
It is a core platform that serves as a foundation for lunch in testing frameworks on JVM, and it provides

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.610
a testing gene for developing and running testing framework on the platform.

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.300
Most popular Java development environments like NetBeans, Intel, AIG, Eclipse and built tools like

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.490
Gradle even and and they all provide first class support for a unique platform.

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.030
And we can use this tools today to run unit tests.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.720
All right.

14
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.420
So think of it as a platform that runs two unit tests that you create.

15
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.980
The second component is G unit Jupyter API, and it is a combination of a new programming model and

16
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.210
extension model for writing tests and extensions in G Unit five.

17
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.590
So Jupyter is a name of the API and Jupyter API is what we used to write Unity and Java.

18
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.540
These are different notations and assertions that we use in our test methods.

19
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.350
And then it also has an extension API that allows us to create our own version of Test API that we can

20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.560
use.

21
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.090
Additionally to Jupiter, the third component is G unit vintage in G unit, meaning that is a test engine

22
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.310
for running all the unit test.

23
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.390
And before grade five there were junior three and four.

24
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.290
So G Unit Vintage provides us with a test engine to run DNA test methods written with older version

25
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.340
of G unit API.

26
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.520
Because of G unit vintage, we can have a project that contains unit tests written with all the G Unit

27
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.160
API and G unit members returned with a newer API version called Jupiter.

28
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.960
Right?

29
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.500
So together these three components make up G these five that we will use in this video, of course.
