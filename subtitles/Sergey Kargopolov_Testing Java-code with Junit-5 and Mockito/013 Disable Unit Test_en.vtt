00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.340
In this final lesson, you will learn about annotation that will help you disable your unit test.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.670
Usually it's not a good idea to disable unit test, and if unit is failing for some reason, and you're

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.730
not sure why it is why we do not disable it, trying to figure out why it is failing and fix it.

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
But if you do need to disable your units, there are a couple of ways to do it.

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.980
The first way is to simply comment out the test annotation.

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.920
So here I have a failing unit test.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.070
I intentionally fail it with fail assertion.

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.140
So to disable this unit test, I can simply comment out the test annotation.

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.320
If there is no test annotation, then it is not a test method and it will not be executed when you run

10
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.030
all your unit tests and it will not be included in a test report.

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.900
So let's try.

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.200
I will save my test class and then I will run all test methods in this class.

13
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.770
Here.

14
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.930
I have my test report and I do not have a failing test anymore.

15
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.380
So this test here that is called test ended your division one dividend is divided by zero.

16
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.510
Each should throw arithmetic exception.

17
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.170
So this test method did not even execute.

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.970
And it is not in the test report because it is not even a test method.

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.360
Now, another way to disable union test is to use a special annotation that is called disabled.

20
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.700
I will enable test annotation and I will add one more annotation maybe on the top disabled.

21
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.240
I can also add a message like for example to do and something like still need to work and.

22
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.220
Like this, and this will be a better way to disable your test because the test will not run, but it

23
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.200
will be included in a test report.

24
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.310
So let's try.

25
00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.310
I will save changes to this test class and now I will go up and will run all test methods in this class.

26
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.370
Now, if you look at my test report, then I clearly see that there is a test method that is disabled,

27
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.420
the pistons visible and it is better because I can see it and it reminds me that I do have a test method

28
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.010
and I still need to work on it.

29
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.110
All right, so now you know how to properly disable a test method if needed.

30
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.570
But again, if you're working on a team with other developers, you need to commit your code and the

31
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.820
build is failing because of a failing.

32
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.750
You need test matlab.

33
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.870
Do not disable the you need this method just to make your could go through the build stage that you

34
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.020
need.

35
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.650
Test might be failing for a reason and it is better to figure out that reason rather than disabling

36
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.380
the unit test.

37
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.070
All right.

38
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.930
So let's continue to the next lesson.
