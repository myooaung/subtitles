1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,160
Now there are other this matters that you will need to write to complete the create user functionality.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,970
For example, you can write a testimony to validate that an empty last name or empty email or empty

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,900
password also trigger a legal argument exemption.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,260
And you can also write test method to validate if the password, for example, and repeated password

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,440
if they do not match, then an exception takes place.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,860
And you can also implement test method to validate if the password he's eight characters long for example,

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,480
if it is alphanumeric and if it contains at least one special character.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,460
Think of other use cases.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,510
And then for each each case create a separate test method depending on the business requirement for

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,410
your application.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,180
There can be many other features that you can develop following test during development.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,630
For example, you can also implement a separate test method and make sure that users first name is longer

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,640
than one character and shorter than, let's say, 30 characters or even better.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,640
You can follow the new and development process to implement a separate validator class, and this one

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,990
beta class will have methods that validate each of this user properties.

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,250
And then you can inject this validator class into create user method or even clause as dependency injection

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,230
and then use it in create user method to make sure that user details about it.

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,170
There are different ways how you can implement create user functionality right before continuing to

19
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,450
the next section as an exercise.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,130
Try implementing a new test method to verify that an empty last name will also make this create user

21
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,880
method through an illegal argument exception but follow through and develop an approach and start writing

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,870
test code first.

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,750
And if you do need help, then you can download source code with a very simple solution that I will

24
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,160
attach to this lecture.
