00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,150
In this lesson, you will learn how to expert code coverage support in each demo format so that you

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,060
can share it with other team members if needed.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,520
And to do that, you will need to first run our unit test and generate code coverage report.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,790
So I will run my unit tests with code coverage.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,940
Now that I have my code cover coverage generated, I can export it.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,340
And to do that, I can either click on this button here in the test results report.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,560
It's called export test results.

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,080
Or I can also click on this button here on the code coverage panel.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,370
And the button looks exactly the same as in test results.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,360
And if you move mouse over it, it says generate coverage report.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,920
So I'll click on it.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:55,350
And now I need to provide a path to a folder where I want to export code coverage reports in each more

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,310
format and if needed.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,160
You can also select this checkbox here that says open generated each demo in the browser window.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,850
So I will keep this checkbox selected and will click on Save Button.

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,930
And now I have my quote, courage report exploited in a shallow format and opened in a browser window.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,890
Now, this report contains same code coverage information as I saw it in Anthology Development Environment.

18
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:30,380
I see a clickable package name and code coverage breakdown for class method and number of lines.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,030
If I click on the package name, I will see a breakdown by each Java class and if I click on the class

20
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,240
name, for example, user service implementation, then I'll see source code of this class and lines

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,270
of code that have been covered with units will be highlighted with green, and lines of code that have

22
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,830
not been covered with unit tests will be highlighted with a red card.

23
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,430
All right.

24
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,290
So now let's check the folder where we have exported this HTML fonts.

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,310
I will bring in Finder Window and this is the folder where I have exported my report.

26
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,440
It's called Test Report and it has HMO files.

27
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,790
It has JavaScript images and CSS files.

28
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,870
If I need to publish this report on local intranet so that my other team members can see it, I can

29
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,380
do that.

30
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:28,640
Or I can simply zip this entire folder and send it over to other external third party so that they can

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
have a look at it.

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,930
All right.

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,340
So it all worked for us.

34
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,970
And now you know how to generate code, college support and how to export it in a demo format as well.

35
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,080
Let's continue.
