1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:09,530
Now if we need to test the four get users method is properly integrated with Sprint framework and if

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:16,490
it works well in Sprint web player, we do not want to isolate or get users method completely.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,750
We do want some of sprint framework features to be available to us, but only to a web player.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,250
For example, we do want to test and make sure that gate users method can be triggered by HTTP get request

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,360
and that it can read HTTP request parameters.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,480
So in this case we do want annotations like rest controller or git mapping or request mapping to be

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,280
enabled and to work.

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,230
So we do want actual integration with Sprint framework in the web player.

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:54,320
But because we're not testing other two layers, we are not testing service layer and we are not testing

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,260
data layer.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,970
We do not need these layers to be enabled and we do not need them to be loaded into sprint application

12
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,690
context.

13
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:09,530
And the good news is that Sprint framework does allow us to test each layer of our application architecture

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:17,900
separately and there is a way for us to test web layer separately from service layer and from data layer.

15
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,760
So when we want to test a rest controllers only, we need to work with web layer.

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,940
Only other layers will not be involved.

17
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,110
And in this case, Sprint framework will create sprint application context for web layer only and only

18
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:39,080
those beans that are related to web layer will be created and will be loaded into sprint application

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,770
context and beans that are related to data layer.

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,140
Like for example, user repository.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,430
They will not be created and they will not be loaded into application context.

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,490
So because other layers are not loaded and are not involved, our test will run faster.

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,140
The unit test that we will create in this case will be called integration test.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,880
And this is because we are no longer testing the get users method in isolation.

25
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,919
This time we are testing gate users method and it's integration with Sprint framework.
