00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,290
Previous lesson you have learned how to stamp avoid method with exception.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,650
And to do that we have used mikita's do throw function.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,730
Another very useful Makita, what is called do nothing and it is used to make void method do nothing

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,720
when it is invoked.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,200
For example, here in this test method we have configured our email verification service mock object

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,680
to through email ID service exception when key your email confirmation method is called.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:36,380
If I use do nothing right after it, then it will overwrite this consumer behavior and will make this

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,660
case.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,560
Your email confirmation method do nothing when it is called.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,490
Let's try.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,720
So instead of do throw, I will use do nothing when email would ification service mock object is used

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:57,120
to invoke ski to email confirmation method with any object of user data that find this.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Now, if I ran this test meant it, then I expect it to fail because this Kishore Kumar confirmation

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,790
method will do nothing and it will not throw exception that we are expecting here.

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,900
So let's try.

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,510
And here we go.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,630
Our test method fails with an error message that it should have thrown a user service exception instead.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,940
We were expecting use a serious exception, but nothing was thrown.

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,630
All right.

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,870
So if in one of the lifecycle setup methods, for example, you have previously stubbed your void method

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,080
to throw an exception and you do not want this behavior in other test methods, then you can use do

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,540
nothing to explicitly tell my client that you do not want to invoke this method if it is called.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,940
All right, so now let's and delete this to nothing and make our method pass again.

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,140
And we'll do it at save changes and run my test methods once again.

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,430
And now it passes.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,090
All right.

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,020
So let's continue.
