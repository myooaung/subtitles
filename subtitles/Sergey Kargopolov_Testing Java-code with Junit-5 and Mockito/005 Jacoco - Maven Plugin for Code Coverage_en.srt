00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,000
In previous lesson, you have learned how to configure Maven to exploit regular test reports in HTML

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,450
format.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,620
And in this video lesson we will configure this same Maven based project to generate code coverage report

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,670
and export it in each HTML format around some to make MAVEN generate an expert code coverage report.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,420
We will need to add to our project one more plug in and to find this plugin, I'll go back to my browser

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,110
window and we'll go to Maven repository dot com and we'll search for this plugin using this search bar

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,710
at the top.

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,280
The plugin is called Coco Maven plugin.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,820
So the in that I'm looking for is called Jack Coco and it is number one in search result.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,480
The name of the plug in Jack Coco stands for Java code coverage and it will help us exploit code coverage

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,720
report in a demo format when we execute our unique tests using MAVEN.

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,920
So I will open it and I will click on the latest version and we'll copy its example code snippet.

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,230
I'll go back to my sample file and we'll add it as a new plug in.

14
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,490
Now I will need to replace dependency with plug in.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,210
And now that they have found this plug in, there are a couple of configurations that I need to make.

16
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,020
And the first configuration will go into execution section.

17
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,300
So inside of the plug in and a new section that is called Executions.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,360
And I will add one execution.

19
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:45,610
The idea of this execution will be prepare agent, prepare a Dutch agent, and it will have a goal that

20
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,770
will need to go into goals section.

21
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,450
And the name of the goal is also called Prepare Agent.

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,700
That.

23
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,620
So this first execution is needed to do some initialization for Jack.

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:01:59,770
Okay.

25
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:06,130
Agent But the second execution that we are going to add will make Jack execute its report.

26
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,740
Go with me, then execute the test phase so I will add one more execution.

27
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,060
The idea of this execution will be called report and it will also have goals section and the name of

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,590
the goal is a report.

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,190
All right.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:32,030
So here with this configuration, we are making Cocker execute this call that is called report during

31
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,580
and we even test face and the name of the phase I will on right after the I.D..

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,910
Okay.

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,570
So here with this new configuration, we are making a executed circle that is called report.

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,070
During the maven's test face execution and this is a we can now save our opponents camo font and triaging

35
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,130
the reading at this point let's click on this button in the top right corner to load menu and changes

36
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,660
and we're going to continue.
