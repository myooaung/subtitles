1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,920
Now there are different ways to create a project, and there are different tools to build and manage

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,540
dependencies in our project.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,590
Which one of these tools you use?

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,400
I do not know, but there is a first class support for a unique platform that exists in popular ideas

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
like Anthology, Eclipse, NetBeans and the Visual Studio Code.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,600
And there are many popular build tools that support G-Unit.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,080
Some of them are made in the cradle and and for example.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,390
So in this video, of course, I'll show you how to set up G unit in different types of projects.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,510
You will learn how to score them G-Unit and Maven and Gradle based Jammer project, and they'll show

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,790
you how to create a new project and how to set up do union using popular development environments like

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,350
anthology and equips.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,110
If you do not use Raven and Gradle, then you can simply skip those lessons until you need them in the

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,530
future.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,410
In section of this course that teaches the basics of G in five, I'll show you how to create a Java

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,810
project and also how to set up G unit without using any of these tools as well.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,380
All right.

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,760
So let's continue.
