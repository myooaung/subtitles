00:00:01.642 --> 00:00:05.078
There are several different pieces that make up your Kubernetes cluster

2
00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:08.205
that is running in the Oracle Cloud Container Engine.

3
00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.359
First are the underlying network resources,

4
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.913
your virtual cloud network, internet gateway,

5
00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:18.157
NAT gateway, route tables, security lists,

6
00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:20.443
and subnets for the nodes that will be running

7
00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:22.860
across multiple availability domains.

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.403
You'll also need to decide if your subnets will be public or private,

9
00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.288
depending on how you need to access your nodes.

10
00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:36.122
For the Kubernetes cluster itself, the master components are an Oracle tenancy.

11
00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:41.864
This is the part of Kubernetes that is being managed for you by the service.

12
00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:43.243
Finally, the node pool,

13
00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.737
the machines that will actually run your containers;

14
00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:49.292
you'll decide the image shape, how many of those,

15
00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:53.063
and where in the network those will run.

16
00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:54.937
To take advantage of this managed Kubernetes service,

17
00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:58.277
we're going to quick create a cluster.

18
00:00:58.277 --> 00:01:01.485
This is the fastest way to stand up a Kubernetes cluster in the

19
00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:03.771
Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes.

20
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.352
In order to do this,

21
00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:10.050
you must allow the Oracle Kubernetes engine to create resources for you.

22
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.340
This is done by creating a policy and adding a statement to that policy.

23
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.191
Allow service OKE to manage all-resources in tenancy.

24
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.814
This statement will allow the Oracle Kubernetes Engine to build

25
00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:32.000
up the networking infrastructure that is in your tenancy required to run the Kubernetes cluster.
