1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:05,400
You're going to need a few things to connect to your cluster with kubectl.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,557
First, you'll generate a private key that will be used to sign requests.

3
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:10,930
Next,

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,010
you'll need to upload a public key to your account that will

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,284
verify those requests and install and configure the Oracle Cloud

6
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:23,084
Command Line Interface or CLI on the machine that you want to

7
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,669
use to access your cluster.

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:26,778
You'll creates a kubeconfig file,

9
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,444
then finally you can verify your kubectl connection to your cluster.

10
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:35,537
We're going to walk through how to do each of these items so feel

11
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:38,092
free to follow along with your own cluster.

12
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:42,516
You'll to generate and upload a key to your account.

13
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:45,487
Then open SSL commands that I'll use are included in

14
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,951
the downloads for this course.

15
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,706
First, generate a private key,

16
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:55,188
then change the permissions so other users cannot read it.

17
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,236
Next, generate a public key from that private key.

18
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:02,052
Your public key should look something like this.

19
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,591
Use your favorite way for your operating system to copy it to the clipboard,

20
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:10,242
then open your user profile and scroll down to API Keys.

21
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:15,874
Select Add Public Key, and paste your public key in the box.

22
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:18,942
Notice the fingerprint that is generated from that public key.

23
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:24,207
Go ahead and select that so you can make sure that it was uploaded correctly.

24
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:26,555
From your local machine, generate a fingerprint,

25
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:31,097
then compare it with the fingerprint that was shown when you uploaded the key.

26
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,474
If they match, you know that your key was uploaded correctly.

27
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:35,030
If not,

28
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,106
you may need to repeat the steps to upload your key and make sure that

29
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:42,854
it matches the key that you have on your machine.

30
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:47,605
Now you can install the Oracle CLI on your machine.

31
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:50,192
I've included the relevant commands that you can download in

32
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,694
the Exercise files sections of this course.

33
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:57,582
The Oracle CLI utilizes Python so you'll need that on the system.

34
00:01:57,582 --> 00:02:00,633
This command will download the install script,

35
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:05,302
and I'm going to just accept the default locations to install everything.

36
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:08,319
You can choose whether you want it to modify your path or not.

37
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,463
Then to verify the install, simply run oci -v.

38
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:18,945
You should see the version of the OCI CLI that was installed.

39
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:21,204
There's a few pieces of information you need to

40
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:23,795
gather from our Oracle Cloud console.

41
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,526
First, we'll get the tenancy OCID.

42
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:29,964
Under your user profile, click Tenancy,

43
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:34,046
then the OCID is listed under Tenancy Information.

44
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:37,823
Use the link to copy this, then set it aside while we gather a few other items.

45
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,082
Next is the user OCID.

46
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:43,253
On your user profile, click your username,

47
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:50,712
then under User Information, the OCID is listed.

48
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,704
Now that you've gathered all of those IDs, you're ready to configure your CLI.

49
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:56,309
Run oci setup config,

50
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:00,482
then it will ask you where you would like to put your config.

51
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:02,551
I'm going to accept the default,

52
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:09,929
then provide the user and tenancy OCIDs that you collected earlier.

53
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,834
Next, enter the region where your cluster is located,

54
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:17,052
then here be sure to select No.

55
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,547
Let me say that again.

56
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:23,652
You already uploaded your key that you will use to sign the requests.

57
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:27,329
Put N for No, then provide the path to your private key.

58
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,825
Note that it reminds you to upload the public key through the console,

59
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:35,408
but that's already taken care of so let's move on to the next step.

60
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:40,535
Go to your cluster dashboard by navigating to the Clusters menu,

61
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,324
then selecting your cluster.

62
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,585
Select Access kubeconfig,

63
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:49,133
then it will provide you some information on how to create the kubeconfig file.

64
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,120
If you don't already have one,

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,882
you can create a .kube directory in your home directory.

66
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:56,157
Next,

67
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:59,716
you can run the CLI command to create a kubeconfig for you

68
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:03,254
with the appropriate values for your cluster.

69
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:07,072
You can open that config to see what was created.

70
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:14,000
Now you should be able to run a kubectl command like get nodes and see the nodes that are running in your cluster.
