(Music) Hi everyone!

2
00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.326
My name is Craig Golightly, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:13.813
Deploying a Java App with Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes.

4
00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.381
I am a senior software consultant.

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.232
You've Docker-ized a Java app, and now you want to run it on Kubernetes,

6
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.818
but you don't want to set up everything from scratch.

7
00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:23.825
You'd like to just push your image to a repository,

8
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:27.575
then deploy it to a running Kubernetes cluster.

9
00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:28.111
In this course,

10
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.417
we are going to set up an Oracle Cloud account so you can use

11
00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:35.351
their managed registry and container engine to make it easy

12
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.752
to run your app on Kubernetes.

13
00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:40.067
Some of the major topics that we will cover include:

14
00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:45.368
opening an Oracle Cloud account, creating a Kubernetes cluster,

15
00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.548
pushing a Docker image to the Oracle Cloud registry,

16
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:51.877
deploying your app on a Kubernetes cluster.

17
00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:52.757
By the end of this course,

18
00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:56.276
you will be able to push a Docker image to the Oracle Cloud

19
00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:59.668
infrastructure registry and deploy that image on the Oracle

20
00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:02.035
Cloud container engine for Kubernetes.

21
00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:03.643
Before beginning the course,

22
00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:07.647
you should be familiar with Docker and Kubernetes and have an

23
00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:10.922
environment with Docker and kubectl installed.

24
00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:14.171
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about running your

25
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:18.718
Docker app on a managed Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud with the

26
00:01:18.718 --> 00:01:28.000
Deploying a Java App with Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes course at Pluralsight.
