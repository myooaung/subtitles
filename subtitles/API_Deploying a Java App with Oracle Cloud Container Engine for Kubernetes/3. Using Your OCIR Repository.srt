00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:03,695
Let's take a look at the specific information you will

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:06,929
need to perform the Docker login, Docker tag,

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:12,468
and Docker push commands in order to get your image into your OCIR repository.

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,769
The server you log into is different,

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,801
depending on what region your registry is in.

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:22,569
Each region has a region code, which is usually a three-letter abbreviation.

7
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:27,418
I've included a link to the documentation in the exercise files for this course,

8
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,018
where you can look that up for your region.

9
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:33,310
If your registry is in the US West Phoenix region,

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,677
you would use docker login phx.ocir .io.

11
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:43,573
The username you need to provide is a combination of the tenancy namespace,

12
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,929
slash, your Oracle Cloud username.

13
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,615
Tenancy-namespace is the auto-generated Object Storage

14
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,593
namespace string of your tenancy,

15
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:57,157
and can be found on the Tenancy menu in the Oracle Cloud console.

16
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,874
You'll see exactly where to find that in the demo.

17
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:00,269
Finally,

18
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:05,597
the password you need to provide is the auth token you generated in the

19
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:09,631
Oracle Cloud console and will look something like this.

20
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,718
For docker tag,

21
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:15,485
the image-identifier is either the image id or the name:tag on the

22
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:19,333
source system that identifies the image you want to tag.

23
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,398
Target-tag is a combination of several different things.

24
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:22,950
First,

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,535
the region-code and tenancy-namespace are the same as what you used in the

26
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:31,517
Docker login command that we talked about on the previous slide.

27
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,712
Next, repo-name is an optional parameter,

28
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:38,866
which indicates the repository in your registry you want to push the image to.

29
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,106
If the repository doesn't already exist,

30
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:45,967
a new private repository is automatically created for you.

31
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:48,164
If you don't include a repository name,

32
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:53,373
then the image name is used to identify a private repository for the image.

33
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:56,267
Image-name is the name you want to give the image in the

34
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,790
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry,

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,758
and tag is the image tag you want give the image in the OCIR.

36
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:07,076
Here's an example of what that would look like with the values filled in.

37
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:11,744
Docker tag, image identifier, region code,

38
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:18,361
.ocir .io / tenancy namespace, slash repo name,

39
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,525
slash image name, colon tag.

40
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,996
For Docker push,

41
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:27,952
note that the target-tag format is the same as what you used for Docker tag.

42
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:31,802
Now you'll simply push the image that you tagged.

43
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:43,000
For example, docker push, region code, .ocir .io / tenancy namespace, /repo name, /image name:tag.
