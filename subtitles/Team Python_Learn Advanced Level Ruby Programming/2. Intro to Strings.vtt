Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.400
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.180
And in this story, we will start on with the introduction to strength.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.150
So basically, what is a string?

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.550
A string is basically a sequence of one or more characters that may contain letters, numbers and symbols.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.980
Strings in Ruby are objects.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.860
And unlike other programming languages, strings are immutable, which means they can be changed in

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.150
a certain place.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.660
Instead of creating new strings, you'll strings in almost every program you write strings, let you

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.930
display and communicate with your user using text.

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.490
In fact, whatever you are going to code, it will have something which you will be displaying as it

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.160
is on your atom or other.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
So strings are one of the most important fundamentals of programming.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.950
In this section, you learn how to work with strings in Ruby.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.100
You will create string, display them on the screen, stored them in variables, join multiple strings

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.530
together and learn how to handle special characters such as new lines, apostrophes and double codes

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.630
and many other important things that are surely related to strengths.

18
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.340
So that was a brief introduction to what our strengths and what is their purpose in Ruby programming

19
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.820
language.

20
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.400
So I guess that to do with this tutorial.

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.710
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

22
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.540
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
