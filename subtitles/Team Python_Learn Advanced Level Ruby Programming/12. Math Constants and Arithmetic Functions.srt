00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,850
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,270
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another detail on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,800
And in this tutorial we will be discussing about some maths constants and some maths methods.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,490
So starting off with the maths constants.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,060
So now and if you're familiar with the background of mathematics, which I hope you are so you must

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,250
be familiar with the value of pi.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,830
You must be familiar with the value of each and many other constants which have a constant value because,

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,890
you know, for the value of PI, it is always going to be equal treatment 14 and for the value of E,

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,330
it is going to be two point seven months.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,830
So these are the values which are basically constants in maths.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,180
And that's why in Ruby they're also known as maths constants.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,980
So we will be doing some examples of maths constants and we will be.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:59,480
Seeing how the value of fire and is going to be generated in Ruby, so let's just first discuss some

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,500
Ruby math matters.

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:11,330
So starting on with the ARC, cosign the math dot, a course is used to calculate the arc cosine.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,100
And then we had the math dot Ecorse with an exclamation mark as well.

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,540
So we also have the hyperbolic arc cosine.

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:29,420
We have the arc sine, we have the hyperbolic arc sine, we have the ARC Tenjin and in that we have

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,390
the 18 that takes an X argument, then 18 to takes X and Y arguments.

20
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,350
And you know, if you're familiar with the math background, you know what is going on in here, then

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,860
we have the hyperbolic arc danger, then we have the arc cosine talking about some more methods.

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,690
We can calculate the cosine of a function of any kind of value we have.

23
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,810
Then we have the hyperbolic cosine, then we have the sine, then we have the error function, then

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,670
we have the complementary error function.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,380
Then we have base X of the Iler Theorem, then we have the normalized fraction and exponent.

26
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,140
And for all of this description, you can just see the method on the left side as well.

27
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,040
Then we have the hypotenuse, then we had the floating point of value that is corresponding to Mandisa

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,950
and Exponent, then we have the hyperbolic sine, then we have the square root function that is used

29
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,210
to calculate the square root of a value.

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,580
Then we have the tangent, then we have the hyperbolic tangent.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,350
And I guess that's all we have.

32
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:34,790
Yes.

33
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,370
So let's move on to some examples now before we move on to examples.

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,400
If you guys don't have any idea of these functions, then this means that you're not familiar and are

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,910
not good in mathematics, because these are some of the very, very, very basic things you must know

36
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,710
in mathematics.

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,640
If you don't know about any of these.

38
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,110
So I just suggest that you go on and search what is sign hyperbolic.

39
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,390
What a sign, what a square root, what it's danjean and things like those before you start on with

40
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,110
this tutorial.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,820
But I hope that 99 percent of you knows about what is this, because this is just a basic concept of

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,650
mathematics.

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,320
So starting on with the maths constants.

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,390
So let's move on to Atom.

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:28,700
And here are what we're going to do, is that you have to simply write in math, Dot.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,440
By but you don't have to use the dot operator, you have to use double calling operator.

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,700
Now, why do you have to use this double calling operator, because in the description of double calling

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,570
operator, I told you that the double calling operator is basically used with constants and since fire

49
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,320
is a constant.

50
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,040
So that's why you have to use this double call in here.

51
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,440
And you also have to specify bots run this.

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,350
And as you can see that the value of PI is generated.

53
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,950
That's three point one four one five nine three.

54
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:10,330
Then you can also calculate some values for other constants that includes E!

55
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:17,530
And you also, again, have to use this to call an operator because E is again a constant press order

56
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,930
and it is going to generate the value of E, which most of you are familiar with.

57
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,560
So that's the value of you, which is again, a constant.

58
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,390
So that's what constant you can just print out the value of any kind of constant using this method.

59
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,500
Now, let's move on to the maths function we have discussed right at the top here.

60
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,170
So let's just discuss some very basics of them.

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,200
So let's say we want to calculate the costs of, let's say, some value.

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,110
So let's move on to Adam and let's say we want to calculate.

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,370
The Matt.

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,920
DOD costs, which is basically the Syntex for that you can see right over here, and what you have to

65
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,590
do is that you have to specify brackets and specify the value for which you want to calculate the cost.

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,870
So just press all are, but you have to use the pots as well.

67
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,730
My bet, Aldar, and it is going to generate the cosine value for this 90.

68
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,060
So if you specify, let's say, one to Hill press Aldar and you can see that it has generated five four,

69
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,200
which is the cosine value.

70
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,260
I don't know how it is calculated.

71
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,620
Some of you must have the tables that contains the cosine values and that teaches you how to calculate

72
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,520
cosine values.

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,350
But you don't have to go to them.

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,150
You have your calculators nowadays.

75
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,910
So that's the cosine value that that's how cosine values are actually calculated.

76
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,970
If you want to calculate, let's say, the sign of a value, just specify.

77
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,170
And Aldar and zero point eight four is your answer if you want to calculate the tangent and order.

78
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,760
And that is going to be the answer.

79
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,860
If you going to do something, let's say something a bit more complex.

80
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,260
That is, let's say arc cosine.

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:18,840
Going to Adam and let's just type in a sign, Aldar and one point five seven is going to be the R cosine

82
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
of this one.

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,540
So if you want to, let's take a look at the square root of a specific value, just type in security.

84
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,930
Let's dive in 16.

85
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:36,720
Aldar and 4.0 is going to be the answer since sixteen four is basically put into four is 16.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,960
So that's why the square root of sixteen is equal to four.

87
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:48,910
And that's how you can use any of these maths function on any of the value you want to use.

88
00:06:50,370 --> 00:07:00,180
So I guess you are good to go and use any kind of the previous functions in your examples and you can

89
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,840
use any of them to calculate or go on with any kind of maths calculations, either be the constants

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,070
or the maths functions.

91
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,580
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

92
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,440
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

93
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,780
And I will see you guys in the next tutorial.
