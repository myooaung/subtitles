00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,620
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,160
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,980
And in this tutorial, we are going to be covering two more functions.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,070
The first one is going to be clear and then we are going to be covering the lead.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,690
So starting on with the first function we are going to cover in this tutorial is the clear function.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,820
But Clear is a string class method in Ruby, which is used to make the string empty.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,120
Simple enough talking about the syntax of this, it as simple as that string, not clear what you have

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,790
to write to get the string clear.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,670
And the second function we are going to be covering in this story is going to be the delete method in

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,160
Ruby.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,700
Now the lead is a string class method in Ruby, which is used to perform at lead operation returning

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,610
the given string or it is going to return if the given string was not modified.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,350
Talking about the syntax of this, it is string to delete and it also has the parameters and hair string

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,890
is the given in the given string and parameter list are the specified characters and what it is going

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,470
to return is it is going to return if the string is not modified as it is going to return something.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,660
So let's move on to the examples and see how these work on our atom's Ed.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,870
So here we are.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,600
So starting off with the first one we are going to go in this tutorial is the clear function.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,190
So let's say we have a string.

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:36,870
That is something like this, so we're going to do just try and put a lid on this and you can just see

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,730
the output in just a while.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,260
Yes, it has this output that is strong, but if you just right in a hill.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:51,320
But it's not clear or underscored now you can see that an empty space has been created.

24
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,110
Right, a hill.

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,050
Now, this empty space is created because now it contains nothing if you just ride and puts it down

26
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,710
here.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,250
So if you just run this code now, you can see that now an additional third space has also been created

28
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,680
because the first spaces for this line and the second space is for this land, because now it contains

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,890
nothing.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,670
So that's how basically the clear function works in Ruby now moving towards the second part of the editorial

31
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,260
that deals with the delete function.

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,430
So for that, we also have to have a string.

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,180
So let's say we have the same string.

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,510
And now what we are going to do is that we are going to apply the delete function and we are going to

35
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,960
just write in the characters we want to delete from it.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,830
So we are going to write inputs, you know, delete, and then we are going to specify the parameters

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,110
that are going to contain the string which we want to delete.

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,950
So here we have this as extras.

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,830
We are going to just write in geological.

40
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,910
Run the score and you can see that both the GS have been missing now now, for example, if a G is right

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,970
over here as well.

42
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,420
We now run this code that G is also missing from here.

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,490
So this is basically over here is use this function to lead is to delete a specific string wherever

44
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,550
it occurs in a certain character.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,660
So let's say we have a sentence that is something like this.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,440
And if you just run this code now, you can see that wherever it finds a G, it is going to delete it.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,380
But I guess I did not have any kind of video here.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:37,240
Let's do it for J because we have got a lot of JS, so just run it and you can see that average is disappeared

49
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,750
from here.

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,970
Similarly, you can do it for words over here, for example, if you have like Jamm.

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,550
Let's say it is, man.

52
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,430
Then you have, let's say, BI's.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:00,750
Let's say Apple, then let's say jam, jam band jam, so you have got a lot of jams over here.

54
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,930
What you want is that you want to just delete the jams from here.

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:11,010
So instead of just doing like this and there's a lot you can simply do is you can write and put it right

56
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,110
in the character you want to delete from this string.

57
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,810
Just run the score and you can see that jam is simply missing from the scenes.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,830
So that's how basically the delete function works in Ruby.

59
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,550
And for example, you enter something that does not exist over here.

60
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,640
So, for example, I just ride in guava will help run this goat.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,840
You can see that it has it is going to just delete the strings and it is going to now treat it as single

62
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,550
letters and it is going to delete all the is it is going to really use it is going to delete all the

63
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,860
guy that is going to be so it works something like this.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,080
So for example, in all of this, we do not have any kind of zadow here.

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,950
So let's just enter.

66
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,850
Is that O'Haire around this code and you can see that you have got the very same string as we have written

67
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,570
right over here.

68
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:10,540
So that's how basically the delete function works in Ruby, that is to delete a certain string certain

69
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,410
characters from a specific string.

70
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,960
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

71
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,390
Thank you so much, gas, for watching.

72
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,370
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
