Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.800
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to our new section here on Discourse on Ruby.

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.140
And in this story, we will cover this section of you.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.340
So in this section, we are going to be covering four important topics.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.690
The theme topic for this section is exception handling.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.920
So in the first part of the section, we will be discussing about the introduction to exceptions.

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.990
In the second part of the sections, we will deal with the exception class hierarchy.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.660
And you are going to see the types of exceptions and then the hierarchy that is followed in each exception

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.100
clause.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
So that is going to be a part of the second part of this section.

11
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.650
In the third part of the section, we are going to go on, with some exception, objects and functions.

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.340
And in the final part of this section, we are going to see how to manually raise some kind of exceptions,

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.420
which you want to do.

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.420
So this is going to be all about exceptions.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.480
And it is also a very important section because the exception is a very important concept in any programming

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.010
language.

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.720
So I guess that's it for this tutorial.

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.040
And the next story will start on with the introduction to exception.

19
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.930
So thank you so much, guys, for watching.

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.030
And I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
