Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,890
This is a manhunt, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Rubia.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,110
And in this tutorial, we are going to see how to rename and delete a file in Ruby.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,960
So if you talk about the syntax for renaming, you can just write in for that new name of the file more

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,100
than what you want to open it.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,000
Or you can just rename an existing file as well.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,370
The symbols indexed for that as you have to write and file, not rename.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,350
You have to write in the old name and then you have to write in the new name of the file, which to

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,580
which you want to rename it.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,740
Simple as that.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,150
Moving on to the deleting syntax, you have to just write and filed or delete and the name of the file

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,040
and that file is going to get deleted.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,800
So this is a very simple tutorial.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,760
Let's just move on to some simple examples as well.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,710
So what we are going to do is that we are going to just rename files.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,780
We are going to write and.

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,630
File Dot Greenham, and we are going to rename a file right from here.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,630
So let's just rename this file Sohel.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,860
So just go back and file, start the expertise.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,150
And the second parameter we are going to specify is renamed DOT the run this code.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,680
Cool back over here and you can see that files has now been replaced with renin.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,070
You can also create a new file and also rename it and there's going to be the very same.

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,100
Next thing is how to delete a file.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,190
So to delete a file, you have to just write and file, dot, delete and in the parameters you have

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,400
to write in the name of the file.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,200
So let's say we want to delete this file over here.

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:46,900
So we are going to write and file dot the city around this code and says no such file or directory.

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,310
All right.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,890
This line has to be removed because it is, again, trying to rename a file that is files it ought to

30
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,940
do, which is now no more a part of the folder.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,090
We are working it, so let's just remove it from this code.

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,690
And now it has run successfully.

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,980
Just go back and you can see that the file dot is actually missing from here.

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,680
So that's how basically you can delete a file in Ruby as well.

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,930
So this was a very simple tutorial in which you have understood how to rename and delete a file in Ruby.

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,560
So I guess that's it for this tutorial.

37
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,740
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,680
And I will see you guys in the next tutorial.
