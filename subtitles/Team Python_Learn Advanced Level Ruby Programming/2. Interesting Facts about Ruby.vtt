Hey, guys, what's up this summer?

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.080
Hi, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.400
And in this story, we are going to be covering some interesting facts you need to know about Ruby.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:21.110
The first one is that Ruby came into existence at Ukiyo Matsumoto that wanted a scripting language that

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.240
is more powerful than Perl and more object oriented than Python.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.200
The second interesting fact here is that the name Ruby for the language got originated in an online

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:43.430
chat session between Masumoto and Kidu issued to Gouta on 24th 1993, before even any code was written

8
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.240
in the language.

9
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.670
Initially, two names were suggested that were Korrell or Ruby.

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.230
The name Ruby was later chosen by Emmott's Moodle in an email to his partner.

11
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.790
The third interesting fact about Ruby is that Ruby is often confused with Ruby on Rails, which is a

12
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.510
server side framework written in Ruby under the midday license for implementing the applications.

13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.920
One more interesting fact over here is that Ruby libraries and packages are managed through the central

14
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.160
library management system called the Ruby Gems.

15
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.400
Next, interesting fact about Ruby is that Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural

16
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.100
programming, object oriented programming, as well as functional programming, which make it unique

17
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.750
in the programming world.

18
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.580
One more interesting fact about Ruby here is that Ruby interpretor can be used as a calculator.

19
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.540
One more interesting fact here is that Ruby has built in support for operational numbers and complex

20
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.710
numbers, which helps in solving complex mathematical problems.

21
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.960
One more factor here is that Ruby allows scored embedding, for example, Rudy Ruby can be embedded

22
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.990
into HDMI.

23
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.400
Interesting.

24
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.550
One more factor here is that Ruby users can take the advantage of dynamic typing and duck typing.

25
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.940
The last encrusting factor here is that Ruby understands and uses an eye instead of and you double and

26
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.210
you is basically used in almost every other programming language like C, C++, Java, Python.

27
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.780
But in Ruby you have to use an eye which makes it different from other languages.

28
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.870
A.

29
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.100
So these were some of the interesting facts about Ruby.

30
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.880
You need to know before you start on with this language.

31
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.550
So I hope you enjoyed this fact.

32
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.800
And I guess that's it with this tutorial as well.

33
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.460
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

34
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.580
And I will see you guys in the next tutorial.
