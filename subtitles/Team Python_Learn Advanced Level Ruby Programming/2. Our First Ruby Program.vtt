00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.600
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.960
This was a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby and in this tutorial,

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.280
basically, as it told you that we are going to be running our very first drone program.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.180
So right on your screen, you can see the Adam Ed, and this is basically the welcome screen.

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.850
And here you can see the welcome guide as well.

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.020
You can see the settings in which you can see that we have installed Adam Runner and always make sure

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.810
that when you start coding, when you start on with your Adam a new day, you always have to see that

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.860
if it is not disabled.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.490
So as you can see over here, that it is enabled and that's why it is an option that is saying to disable

10
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.580
it.

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.340
But we don't want to disable it because we have to use it.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.860
So the first thing you need to do over here is to add a project directory and how this is going to be

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.290
done, just go to file.

14
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.130
Just go on to add project folder.

15
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.060
And you can choose any kind of follow, let's say I want to work on, let's say downloads or let's say

16
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.290
I just want to go on with the documents folder that seems to be good enough or let's just choose the

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.980
download folder and let's just select folder.

18
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.670
So that is going to create the downloads folder for us.

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.510
And this is basically going to be the folder which you are going to be using to create your Ruby programs.

20
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.380
Now, just right, click on this.

21
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.360
Create a new file.

22
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.040
And let's just say that I want to name a post-flight as first file and never forget to add the extension

23
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.480
that is AAB, which means I will be fired.

24
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.520
So this Arbie extension is going to tell this Adam compiler that basically we are trying to run a Ruby

25
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.470
file here and we want to create Ruby Pleyel so that we can run Ruby here.

26
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.560
Just click, enter.

27
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.870
And right on your screen, as you can see, an editorial here, which means that this is basically going

28
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.580
to be your first program area where you are going to go your first post, I'm going to just get rid

29
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.840
of all these windows.

30
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.760
And I only want this one year to be shown right away here.

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.900
So now what I want to do is that I want to go to just.

32
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.570
Dipen, Rubio Hill.

33
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.220
Click on this and let's just keep it running, let's just minimize this.

34
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.490
Now, this is not necessary, but on some systems it may create some issues.

35
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.310
So that's why I've just told you that you must keep this Ruby running.

36
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.190
Oakhill So let's see.

37
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.660
For the first, I want to print a simple statement that is Sprent, unless I want to type in Hello World.

38
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.770
So now to run the school where you have to do is that on some system, it will work.

39
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.960
When you press control are on some systems, it may work with Aldar.

40
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.160
On Mac, it may work with the window type of button that is on Mac and then R and on some systems as

41
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.190
a W, it's going to work with all that plus R, so on my system it works with all plus R, so I'm going

42
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.860
to just click on R plus R and you can see over here that the atom runner has just generated me with

43
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.220
the output of a hill and as you can see that the output is Hello Wood.

44
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.730
So that's how basically your code is going to be compiled.

45
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.390
What we did is that we just created a project folder which can be created from this file at the project

46
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.780
folder.

47
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.480
And when that folder is created, what you can do in that folder is that is where you are going to create

48
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.400
your Ruby files.

49
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.480
So I created the folder first file Dot Arbie as my first file and that I just typed in a simple code

50
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.710
that is the word.

51
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.160
And then depending upon your system, you can just press control are all our windows are.

52
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.310
And one of these options is going to surely work for my system.

53
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.810
It worked with all plus R, so when I clicked on plus R as my brother was running as a showed you at

54
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.950
the start of the Dorelle, that's why this Helliwell is going to be generated.

55
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.400
Right.

56
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.900
Or held.

57
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.870
So that's how basically your first file is going to run on Ruby.

58
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.930
So I guess that's it with Destroy Dorio.

59
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.390
If you have got any kind of errors running your first file, do let me know and I'd be more than happy

60
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.640
to help you out.

61
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.290
So I guess that's it with this tutorial in the next story, we are going to be covering some more interesting

62
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.830
stuff.

63
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.630
So thank you so much, guys, for watching and I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
