Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.500
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another detail on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.770
And in this tutorial, we will be studying about using Granges with strings.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.540
So let's start on.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.330
So, for example, we have, let's say, a string, which is, let's say a number of characters.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.840
Now, in previous tutorials where you have covered ranges, you have covered them with numbers.

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.340
So now in this tutorial, what we're going to do is that we are going to find a number of strings using

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
ranges from this string we have just defined here.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.860
So let's say we want to have some characters from it.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.180
So, for example, we want is that let's strap in boots and this X and you know how to extract string.

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.040
So, for example, if you want to have the zero position, then you can simply specify the zero.

12
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.920
Run this and you will have the first character.

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.400
So you will have you can have any any character you want to extract from this.

14
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.120
But what if you want a number of characters, for example, you want the characters from the zero to

15
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.560
the let's say this is the ninth position, I guess.

16
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
So what you will do is that you will specify DOT nine.

17
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.230
Run the score and you will have these characters that is starting from this gate, though, the latter,

18
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.470
you have specified a hurdle, the ninth position now that is what is called the inclusive search.

19
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.050
Now, if you want to have the exclusive search, then you know that you will have to specify this triple

20
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.930
door to hear her underscore and one character before F is specified or head.

21
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.280
That is this character or her, as you know, that now what it is displaying is that it is not including

22
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.650
this highest and it is displaying the characters from zero till the eighth position, as you have covered

23
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.570
that in the previous tutorial as well, that when you use the triple, not the maximum range is going

24
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.250
to be ignored.

25
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.820
It is going to search for and print out the characters starting from the lowest range in between all

26
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.270
the letters.

27
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.210
But it will not include the highest range.

28
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.670
And if you specify dot dot, then it is going to specify the minimum rate, the maximum range and all

29
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.600
in between these two numbers.

30
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.000
So just run it and you can see that after the S we also got this effort will help.

31
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:30.620
So that's how you can have strings extracted from using ranges and that's how basically you can use

32
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.840
ranges with strings.

33
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.410
So there are many other methods of extracting string from a specified string, but those will be a part

34
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.320
of the future tutorials when we will be discussing the building methods.

35
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.290
That includes the slice method and there are other matters as well.

36
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.830
And one more method you can use apart from these ranges is you can just specify zero.

37
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.020
That is the starting position and you want to let's specify the ten, so I'm going to specify combattants.

38
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.070
So from zero till then location, it is going to bring you the elements you can have, let's say from

39
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.360
two to ten as well.

40
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.910
Rounded score and you will have this started from the second location till this right over here.

41
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.730
That is the tenth location.

42
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.790
So you can have any sequence of characters.

43
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.820
So I guess that's it when extracting string using ranges.

44
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.450
So that's Administrator Aureole.

45
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.250
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

46
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.080
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
