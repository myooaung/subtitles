00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.470
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.190
This is American, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.900
And in this video, we are going to be covering a very important and interesting topic that is about

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.620
taking input from users.

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.100
So I guess I don't have to talk a lot about this.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.130
Let's just go to a quick example for how this is going to be done so that what you need to watch here

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.590
is basically a command line.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040
But what kind of command line do you need?

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.300
Do you need a window line command line?

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.420
Or you have this Ruby command line that is already running away here.

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.570
So what do you actually need?

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.140
Our help?

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.320
Basically, what we need is a command line that is going to run on this very same ed we have right here

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.220
now how this is going to be done.

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.030
But do you have to do is that just going to fly and going to the settings, going to the install and

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.590
you have to search for a package that is a platform you dash.

17
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.100
I'd eat the term.

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.050
You know, when you search for this, you have to wait before it complete its search.

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.600
And right here, I guess it is.

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.200
Yes.

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.920
As you can see at the very top, we have the platform ID terminal.

22
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.390
And as you can see that I have already installed it on my system.

23
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.830
That's why you can just see the uninstall and the disable button for you.

24
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.690
It will have this kind of installed button.

25
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.420
Just click on it and it will install the platform for ID terminal on your system.

26
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.810
And what this is basically this is basically a terminal.

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.580
You may see a command line terminal that is basically present on the ED right here in your atom.

28
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.470
And you can run your ruby files right from this terminal.

29
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.010
So after you have successfully installed platform ID terminal on your system, just close the settings.

30
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.210
We don't need them anymore.

31
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.060
And now what are you going to do is that you can run your any kind of program using that terminal and

32
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.220
for example, I just say puts.

33
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.050
Analysts say, I just say hello, world, so simple enough, let's just spell it all right.

34
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.430
So when you have installed the platform ID terminal on your system, on the left hand corner, you can

35
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.990
now see this plus sign.

36
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.350
Just click on it, wait for a few seconds.

37
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.010
And what it is going to load is basically the current directory, and that is basically the working

38
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.740
folder we have added.

39
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.840
In my case, it is the downloads folder.

40
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.300
So that's why it has already opened this for me, for you.

41
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.330
Whatever folder you are working, it is going to automatically load that folder for you.

42
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.910
You don't have to just go and browse into that folder.

43
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.790
It will automatically open that folder and you can just give the instructions and command to run your

44
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.250
files.

45
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.090
Now, in the previous tutorials, what we have been covering so far, every kind of output was generated

46
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.800
right here on this Adam run.

47
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.180
But now we want to use that platform ID terminal we just installed so that what you hope to do is that

48
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.890
you have to run this first file dot RB.

49
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.750
Now, how that is going to be done, just type in Ruby and give us space and write the name of the file

50
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.490
you want to run to.

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.930
In my guess, it is going to be Ruby Space first file dot RB.

52
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.660
Just click, enter, and you can see that you have this output that is hella wide right here on your

53
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960
terminal window.

54
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.230
So that's how basically you can just display some output using your terminal.

55
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.700
Now, how can you just take an input from the user, for example?

56
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.450
I have only this hello over here, and what I want is that I want to print this line, but before that

57
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.310
I want to just enter the name for which I want to add for example, I want to, let's say, have a name

58
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.670
here.

59
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.350
And I would just step in, get this gets, which means that I want the compiler or this editor and in

60
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.060
Agas this terminal, to ask me for the name which I want to enter and I want to print this name right

61
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.560
to Wahhab.

62
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.240
So I'm going to type in name Aubagio.

63
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.050
Now, what it is going to do is that it's going to ask me for the name first and I'm also going to specify

64
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.470
how.

65
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.600
What's.

66
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.240
Enter your name, so it is going to ask me for the name.

67
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.700
I'm going to enter the name due to this line that is name equal to gets and it is going to then print

68
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.910
out.

69
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.020
Hello.

70
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.220
And last name.

71
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:58.490
So now what we need to do is that you have to just right in Ruby first while R B click enter.

72
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.520
And as you can see that it has printed put enter your name and now the cursor is blinking, which means

73
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.800
that it won't need to enter some input.

74
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.190
Aubagio here.

75
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.470
So let's say I'm going to type in my name, click, enter, and you can see that the output has been

76
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.380
displayed because we have this line here that says hello and then we can GetNet, the name, whatever,

77
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.310
we have entered right over here.

78
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.600
So it has printed Hello Omar for me.

79
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.680
Now you can take in multiple inputs as well.

80
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.430
For example, I want to, let's say, have this name, then I want to say let's say puts.

81
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:42.030
Enter your, let's say, age, and I want to use a variable name equal to age, and I want to just write

82
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.780
and gets.

83
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.900
And now over here, what I'm going to do is that hello, Amir.

84
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.080
A bus operator.

85
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.970
You.

86
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.920
Ah.

87
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.990
Plus, and you have to specify the name of the variable that is each.

88
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.630
Years old.

89
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.170
And a space of here as well.

90
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.010
So now let's just try it again.

91
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.400
Just click, enter, and as you can see, it is me for the name, just click Romero here, click, enter.

92
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.370
And it is going to now ask for the second input that is the age.

93
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.660
Let's say I'm 25.

94
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.970
Click, enter.

95
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.120
And as you can see that it says hello, there you are.

96
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.890
Twenty five years old.

97
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.670
Now you can see one problem.

98
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.920
Well, that after taking every input, for example, after it displayed the first input it asks for,

99
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.810
that was the name.

100
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.830
It created a new line space.

101
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.390
And after that each.

102
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:53.800
It again created a new line and printed the output, whatever was after it, into a new line.

103
00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:01.360
Now, if you don't want this thing, then what you can do is that you can just add see actual MP John-Paul

104
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.590
here.

105
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.330
And what job is going to do is that it is going to exclude the line space that has been added right

106
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.010
to a hill.

107
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.500
So now let's just run the score again, and you can just notice the difference yourself, type in the

108
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.610
name dyed in the age Clevelander.

109
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.780
And as you can see that now everything is on a single line.

110
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.630
Hello, Mario.

111
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.030
You are 25 years old.

112
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:32.810
So what Jump is going to do is that, as you have seen as well, that it is going to just eliminate

113
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.840
the line speed the line additions and the change of the new line, and it is going to display everything

114
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.560
in a single line.

115
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:47.420
If you don't want if you want everything, every input you give and you want to display that input in

116
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.810
a separate line, then you don't have to specify this jump or help.

117
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.900
But if you want to do it, you have to specify this.

118
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.710
John Bohle.

119
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.010
So this was a very, very basic concept of how to take input from the user and how to display it in

120
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:09.970
a single line and how to take in multiple input from the user and how to run the command line and run

121
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.760
your code.

122
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.370
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

123
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.500
I hope you have understood this concept because.

124
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:24.210
A lot of things are going to be dealt using this, and we are going to see a lot of tutorials in which

125
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.770
you will have to take in some input from the user.

126
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.080
So you need to get on with this tutorial.

127
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.920
So I guess that's what this tutorial.

128
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.400
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

129
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.950
And I'll see you guys in the next Turrill.
