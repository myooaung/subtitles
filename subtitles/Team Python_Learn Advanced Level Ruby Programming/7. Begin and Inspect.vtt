Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.570
This was American, and I welcome you to another tutorial on discourse on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.200
And in this tutorial, we are again going to be covering two functions that are bigon and they inspect

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.670
function.

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.480
So starting on with the first function we are going to be covering in this tutorial, that is the big

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.080
function.

7
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.540
The Biggin is an invalid method in Ruby that returns the first element of the given range.

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.470
And if you talk about the syntax for this, it is also going to be very simple.

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.070
It is range.

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.060
One does not begin to function except no kind of parameter.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.770
And if you talk about the return value, it is going to return the first element of the given range.

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.680
So basically begin is the very similar version of using the first function without arguments.

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.710
So moving on to the second function we are going to be covering in this tutorial is the function.

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.430
It is also an invalid function in Ruby that returns that range object in a printable form.

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.950
And if you talk about the syntax, it is going to be again, very simple.

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.520
It has no arguments and it is very simple.

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.040
Lestrange dot instead.

18
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.920
So wasting no time.

19
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.750
Let's move on to our ED to see two very simple examples of both these functions.

20
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.410
So we will start on with the first one that is the big and functions.

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.350
So we will have a range for that.

22
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.950
That is, let's say, 029 And as I told you, that this is very similar to the first function, if that

23
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.750
is used without any kind of argument.

24
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.150
So it is going to be range, dard, begin run and it is going to return.

25
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.630
The first element of the first element was something else.

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.980
It is going to return that element for us.

27
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.420
Then the second function is the fact function that basically return the range objects in a printable

28
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.800
form.

29
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.960
So all you have to do is that you have to just remove this.

30
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.740
You have to write inputs, arrange Dodd, inspect.

31
00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.150
Run this and it is going to inspect the range and it is going to simply return the range for us, that

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.550
is 5.0 nine.

33
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.840
So it is very similar to just writing and Pott's range on your screens.

34
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.440
So you can just write it in both ways.

35
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.180
You can just write and inspect as well, and it is going to return simply the range for you.

36
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.290
So I guess that these were the very two simple examples of how these functions can be used in Ruby.

37
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.360
So I guess that's it with this studio.

38
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.340
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

39
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.890
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
