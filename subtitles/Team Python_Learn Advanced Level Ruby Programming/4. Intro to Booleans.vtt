00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.940
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.740
This was a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Truby and in this Dorio,

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.130
we will go on with a basic introduction to what our booleans in early.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.370
So starting on with the basic introductions, what our booleans, they are named after George Bush,

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.500
who was an English mathematician who spent most of his career as the first mad professor at the Queens

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.270
College in Cork Island.

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.800
In 1854, he authored a book that was named as The Law of Torts, where he laid the foundations of a

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.440
boolean logic, which is a crucial concept, the field of computer science today.

9
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.470
Not talking about billions in Ruby, now Ruby has several data types with which you are mostly familiar

10
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.080
now, the ones you have covered in the previous story include, I guess, the numbers we have covered

11
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.770
strings.

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.010
We got word integer float type, but there are a lot which we'll be covering in the future, tutorials

13
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.230
that include the hashes, symbols, error and many others.

14
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.740
Now, if you talk about booleans, unlike other languages such as JavaScript, C++ and C, we are booleans

15
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.130
are a data type in Ruby booleans are actually not a data type to see what I mean.

16
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.540
What you have to do is that you have to go on and open your editor and know the class of what is the

17
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.650
class of this.

18
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.490
So you will notice that when you call the DOT class on the Boolean values, what did you do that it

19
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.520
will not return a boolean?

20
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.590
So we will covered that.

21
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.750
But before that, I want to show you the.

22
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.730
Tables for some of the boolean operators, the first boolean operator is basically and the result of

23
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.680
which you can see that if both the values are false, then it is going to return false.

24
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.010
If both the values are true, then it is going to return true.

25
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.000
If any of the value is false, the and operator on two boolean values is going to return false.

26
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.800
Then we have the order in which, if any of the input is true, it is going to generate a true value.

27
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.330
Now one here means true.

28
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.650
Zero here means false.

29
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.240
Both are false, which means the output is going to be false.

30
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.850
If any of the value is true or either both are true, it is going to return a true value.

31
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.420
And finally, we have the Nordiques, which is actually the opposite of what we are doing.

32
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.390
If the input is true, the output is going to be false and if the input is true, the output is going

33
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.010
to be false.

34
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.350
So it is basically going to negate what value we have given.

35
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.020
So let's just go for some quick examples.

36
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.010
So the first thing we have to do is that as a tool, you.

37
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:03.010
That if you call the matador class on, different debt arrives, you will see the return value for those.

38
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.710
But as I told you, that bullion is actually not that type in Ruby.

39
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:17.450
So if you call in Drew and you write in class at a Put's at the start or underscored, you can see that

40
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.250
the debt I will have right over here is not bullion, but it is struggle's.

41
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.030
Similarly, if you do it for also a hill.

42
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.720
Run the score, then you can see that the output generated is basically false glass.

43
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.230
So you have noticed here that if you call the dot glass on true and false, the return values are true

44
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.020
glass and the false glass, not boolean.

45
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.670
Interestingly, the value true is the only instance of the glass through glass and the value falls is

46
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.850
the only instance of the false glass.

47
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.350
Now the question is that why do we need booleans now?

48
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.830
Booleans are great for introducing control.

49
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.880
Floor control floor is basically just a fancy way of referring to how we control the flow of our program.

50
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.340
In other words, it's how we tell the computer to execute certain lines of code at a certain time.

51
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.520
So.

52
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.740
At this time, I cannot give you quick examples of controlled flow because you don't know what is controlled

53
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.210
flow and controlled flow is basically a part of future tutorials.

54
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.640
The purpose of this tutorial was to just give you a quick introduction and a very basic introduction

55
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.020
of what our booleans in Ruby and how Boolean is not a valid and true class and Polglase is duty.

56
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.950
And why do we need booleans in Ruby?

57
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.810
So we will be covering a lot of things on booleans in the future tutorials when we will be covering

58
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.270
the controls or because whatever we are covering so far is basically an introduction to everything we

59
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.890
will be covering in detail in the future tutorials.

60
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.190
So you have already covered the Boolean operators, so I guess that's it with this Dorio.

61
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.870
Thank you so much, guys, for watching and I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
