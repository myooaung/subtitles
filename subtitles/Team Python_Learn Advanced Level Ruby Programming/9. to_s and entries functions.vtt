Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.030
This is American, and I welcome you to another Dooralong discourse on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.610
And in this Durel, we are going to be covering two functions.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.960
Again, the first function is going to be the to underscore s function and the second function is going

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.300
to be the entries functions.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
So starting on with the first function, that is the two underscore s function.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.780
So you already have word this to underscore s function.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.440
And you know that this is basically used to convert something to a string.

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.100
But in this story, to be specific, we are going to see how to underscore as is going to be used with

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.050
ranges.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.190
So it is a building method in Ruby that returns a string containing the given range.

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.570
So the syntax for it is very simple.

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.530
You just have to write in range and then you have to write in the name of the function and it accepts

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.430
no kind of parameter.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.100
The second function we are going to be covering in this literal is the entries function, which is a

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.310
building method in Ruby that returns an array containing all the elements of the given range.

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.780
And if you talk about the syntax for this, it is going to be range dot entries and it also accepts

18
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.700
no kind of argument.

19
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.200
So if you just talk about the examples for this, so let's move on to our Ed.

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.010
So let's say we have a wrangel here that is from zero to nine, and what we want to do is that we want

21
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.810
to convert this range to string.

22
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.020
So we are going to just have a variable that's A.

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.340
S and we are going to write and range to underscore s.

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.120
And what that is going to do is that is going to convert our range into a string so you can just try

25
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.670
and put s run this code.

26
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.970
And it will run in a short while.

27
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.670
And as you can see, that you have got your range right over here, which is basically now a string.

28
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.820
The second function is the entries function.

29
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.040
So we are going to have a variable E and we are going to write in range DOT.

30
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.080
And trees, and as I told you, that what it is going to do is that it is going to return the entries

31
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110
in the form of an area.

32
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.910
So just right inputs e around this code.

33
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.330
And as you can see, that you have got this set of elements which were a part of this range.

34
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.140
And basically this is now an area.

35
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.370
So that was about these two functions and a very simple way to how this can be used in code.

36
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.590
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

37
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.270
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

38
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.370
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
