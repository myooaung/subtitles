00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,110
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,310
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Truby.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,490
And in this drill we will talk about the bag methods we have in early.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,080
Now, before we talk on about bag methods, we have to have a little background of a certain method

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,650
and how the original value does not change for that.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,930
So, for example, we have, let's say, a variable X in which we have let's say.

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:37,650
Something like human capital, a i r, as you can see, that you and our capital, Roger and I are are

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,770
in the small cases now what if I write in votes?

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,870
Export down gays now donkeys is a building method that is applied on strength and what to do is that

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,740
it convert this entire string into donkeys as if I just run this goat.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,370
You can see that the entire name is now in donkeys, as you and also in donkeys is.

12
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,500
But what if I write in books X after I have donkey Usted if I just run this goat?

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,520
You can see that even though I have done guessed it on the previous line.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,470
But still when I printed out the normal character, I have got this you and this over here.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,090
So this means that the original character has not changed.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,900
It has only changed.

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,830
Should that letter when I used it in that specific line.

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:36,110
So for this, it is going to print out you and I in smoggiest, but it hasn't made any change to this

19
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,200
variable X and when I write in BoSox, it is going to have this E and you in capital case.

20
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,410
Now, what if you want to have changed the string?

21
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:55,600
What if you want that you and I should always be in the markets and you want that change, but you have

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,200
applied right here to be on the strength.

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,110
So what you will do is that you will just add an exclamation mark over here, run the score, and now

24
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,540
you can see both the outputs that you have got.

25
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,010
Umea, you are in small games.

26
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,220
And then again, you have got you are in the small case now.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,860
That is what is called a bag method.

28
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,310
And they usually modified the object that they are being called on.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,260
So this exclamation mark means that now the donkeys is going to reference to the object, which means

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,140
it is going to refer to the object or you must say the location where this X is located.

31
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,740
And it is going to make that change on that object's location.

32
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,440
So that change, which we have applied right here, is now going to be applied on this variable X and

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,740
this variable X is actually going to change.

34
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,130
So that's why I want after applying this change, I write inputs x o'haire.

35
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,250
You can see that I still have Umea.

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,170
You are in small cases now.

37
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,320
Bag methods always remember, ends with an exclamation mark and it often modify the object they're called

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,560
on.

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,010
So whatever you have, for example, you used up this method, then you can specify an exclamation to

40
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,080
make it a bang method and then that change is going to be made to the object.

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,450
You will be calling it on.

42
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,810
So.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,660
Nowadays, programmers have learned that using the bang method has a number of disadvantages and they

44
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,670
should usually be avoided unless there is a very, very good reason for it.

45
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,410
So when you are using bang methods, always use them with caution.

46
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,890
We mostly mentioned this method because you might see them used elsewhere.

47
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,330
So I suggest you don't use them unless there is a very good reason to use them.

48
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:54,130
So because you don't want a variable actual value to get change and you don't want a reference to the

49
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,700
location and change that value because you might be using that value somewhere.

50
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:04,060
But if you want a value to change everywhere in your code, then you can use this exclamation mark,

51
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,650
which will make it a bang method and it will change the original value.

52
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,300
So that's how you can use the bang methods.

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,580
You can use them on any kind of method.

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,930
You can use them on, let's say, uppercase or undiscovered.

55
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,530
And as you can see, that now Umea are both in caps.

56
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,150
And there are a thousand of methods which can be normally applied on string, and after adding an exclamation

57
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,760
mark at the end of that, they'll become the bang methods and they will make whatever change you have

58
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,510
applied on the original string.

59
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,860
So I guess that's it with bang methods.

60
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,400
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next oratorio.
