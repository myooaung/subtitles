Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.190
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby and in this story,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.940
and we are going to create a very simple calculator using functions.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.110
So how this is going to be done.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.660
So we are going to create a very basic calculator, which is only going to have four functions where

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.540
it is going to add two numbers.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.580
It is going to subtract two numbers, it is going to divide two numbers and it is going to only multiply

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.240
two numbers.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.490
The rest of the operations.

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.190
As soon as we learn more and more things, we are going to advance this calculator as well.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.670
And at the end of this course, you are going to have a very, very, very perfect scientific kind of

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.290
calculator.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.130
So let's start on.

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.500
So our first function is going to be add, which is going to basically add two numbers that are going

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.630
to be A and B, which we will pass as an argument from the calling area.

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.280
And this function is going to simply return A plus B and.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.310
All right, not this.

18
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:15.300
And we are going to just end this, so you just copy this bastard again, bastard again is it again?

19
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.500
And the second function is going to be sub, which is going to subtract two numbers.

20
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.940
And then we are going to have Muhal, which is going to multiply two numbers, and then we are going

21
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.430
to have the IV, which is going to divide two numbers and the sub is going to have a minus sign of here.

22
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.420
Then the multiply is going to have a starick over here and the divide is going to have this side of

23
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.800
a hill.

24
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.560
Now, to use all of these functions where you can simply do is that you can have a variable named as,

25
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.080
let's say, a, that is going to equal to add and you are going to pass values which will pass later

26
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.550
and then you will have X that is going to call the subtract function.

27
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.210
Then we are going to have and that is going to call the multiplier function, then we are going to have

28
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.440
these, which is going to call the divide that is the divide function.

29
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.170
So we are going to add some lines to look at more attractive.

30
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.730
So we are going to ride in boats.

31
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.050
Addition.

32
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.270
Of two.

33
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.290
Numbers.

34
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.070
Is.

35
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.440
Then we are going to have votes.

36
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.530
Subtraction of.

37
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.000
Two numbers is.

38
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.710
Then we are going to have Bode's.

39
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.490
Multiplication of two numbers is.

40
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.710
And finally, we are going to have Fuds.

41
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.350
Division of DE.

42
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.120
Numbers is and these are basically going to be the answer.

43
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.810
So now what we can do is that we can just specify then Gomaa five or 10, comma five are going to be

44
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.130
added and we are going to read and Duncombe five, which are going to be subtracted and we are going

45
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.030
to write and come to five, which are going to be multiplied, and then we are going to write and then

46
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.640
five which are going to be divided.

47
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.710
So if I just run this code, you are going to see a calculator over here.

48
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.170
But they are not printing the values because we have not used what's eowa here.

49
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.310
What's Asawa Hill?

50
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.650
Well, it's Amable here and finally, ports deal here.

51
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.680
So now let's just run the score.

52
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.610
And as you can see that it says the addition of two numbers is 15.

53
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.670
Then the subtraction of two numbers is five.

54
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.970
Then the multiplication of two numbers is 50.

55
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.550
And then the division of two numbers is two.

56
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.330
So that was a very basic calculator, which we have made using function.

57
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.360
Now for you guys, I want to assign you a task over here.

58
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.280
I want you to take these two values which we have passed directly.

59
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:20.190
I want you to take them as an input from the user and then pass it to these functions we have defined

60
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.880
right over here.

61
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.460
And I guess, you know, from the starting sections that how to take input from a user.

62
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.990
So I want you to apply that idea.

63
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.890
Well, here, take input of two numbers and then pass all those two numbers right over here.

64
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.100
And in the next tutorial, I will come up with the code again.

65
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.220
So I want you to try it for yourself first and then move on to the next story.

66
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.850
So if any of you guys don't have any idea of how that is going to be done or if you are having any kind

67
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.070
of errors, then in the next iteration you would understand how that is going to be done.

68
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.670
So for this tutorial, that's it.

69
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.260
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

70
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.420
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
