Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.270
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to an editorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.570
And in this story, we are going to see how to reverse a string in Ruby.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.160
Now, this is basically the syntax for doing it.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.500
You have to write in the string you want to reverse and you have to write in dot operator, and then

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.960
you have to write in reverse, which is a building method.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.900
Now, what this function reversal is going to do is that is going to completely reverse the order of

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.600
the letters that are occurring in a specific string.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:42.230
So let's say I have a string that says tutorials then if I just write in votes.

10
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.460
Ex dot reverse.

11
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:56.130
Run this good, then you can see that tutorial is now printed out in the reverse order duty or are as.

12
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.970
So that is the reverse order or you can simply do it in a single line like you can just right in.

13
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.190
The strain right here.

14
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.880
Run the score and you will have the whatever string you have entered and the reverse order, so that

15
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
is how you can basically reverse a string and Ruby.

16
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.220
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

17
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.890
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

18
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.870
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
