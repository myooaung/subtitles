00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,380
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,530
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to an editorial on this course on Aruba.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:12,980
Ruby So in the previous to Dorio, what we have done is that we have completed our installation of Robotham

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,310
on six point five, as well as we have completed the installation for Adam.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,580
Now, what you see on your screen is Adam, as you know now, what we need to do is that we have to

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,340
install Adam and Adam Orender is basically what is going to help us run our Ruby code.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,470
So to install a new package where you have to do, is that just going to install a package?

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,670
Open the installer?

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,410
And this is basically the install package window type of thing, all you have to do is that you have

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,540
to just type in Adam II, front runner up to just wait before it is searching for the package you have

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,530
just entered in the search box.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,110
All right.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,110
So here at the top, you can see Adam Runner dewpoint on point one, which is the latest version.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,720
You can see the number of downloads and you can see its description that says it runs scripts inside

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,110
of Adam.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,220
So all you have to do is just click on this install button.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,810
And what this Adam is going to do is that it is going to install Adam runner on your system, which

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,480
means that it is going to allow and run the scripts inside of Adam.

19
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,700
So as you can see that it says installing two point seven point one failed.

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,410
Let's just try again.

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,910
All right, so you can see that now Adam is successfully installed on your system, and it is also enabled,

22
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,960
as you can see, this disabled button where you can disable it or you can just uninstall it and you

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,550
can just go in and configure some kind of settings for Adam Orender as well.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,000
So now what you have is that you have got Adam and you have got Adam Orender installed, which means

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,270
that now you can run scripts inside of Adam.

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,050
So how all this is done, that is a part of the next tutorial, because in this section, what we were

27
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,680
supposed to do was to install things, set up things.

28
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,060
So we have done that.

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,990
So I guess that's what this tutorial.

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,900
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,150
And I'll see you guys in the next oratorio.
