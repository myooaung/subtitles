00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.290
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.860
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Drillbit.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.120
And in this story, we are going to see how to transform data.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.220
The map method and its allies that is known as the collect method can basically transform the contents

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.550
of an area, meaning that it can perform an operation on each element in the area.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.860
For example, you can just use the map function to perform Artomatic on each entry in an area and create

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.240
a new area that contains the new values.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.810
So, for example, you have an area over here that contains a list of elements, let's say one, two,

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.470
three, four.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.630
And what do you want to do over here is that you want to just square all these numbers using the map

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.990
function.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.670
And that is what is the property of map function, is that it can perform an operation on each element

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.280
in the area.

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.200
So what you can do is that you can just have a variable schema over here that is that stands for basically

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.700
Square and you can just write in X dot map.

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.870
And in here, what you can do is that you can just write in the variable why that is going to grab the

17
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.420
first element and it is going to perform the operation on it.

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.020
And what is going to be the operation that you are going to specify?

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.260
Right.

20
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.690
Well, here you can just write in by Starick why our health?

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.820
And it is going to then grab a second value that is to it is going to perform this operation on it.

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.200
Then it is going to grab the third while you will perform this operation on it for two hours, you and

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.650
so on.

24
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.270
It has any number of values.

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.610
All you can do is just write inputs as you are running the score and you can see that you have got the

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.310
squares, all the numbers, and that is basically a new area that has been retained by this map function.

27
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.210
So the map is basically often used in that publications to transform an area into elements for an HDMI

28
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.080
dropdown list.

29
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.940
So to give you a very simplified version of how that might look.

30
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.980
Let me give you an example for this.

31
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580
So let's say we have some elements of a hill.

32
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.040
That, let's say, says.

33
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.970
Debow than it has, let's say, Chir.

34
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.770
Then let's say it has your cell phone.

35
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.790
And then let's say it has a wall here.

36
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.710
So these are, let's say, the four elements that are in this area.

37
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.010
What you can do over here is that you can just ride in your hill and you can just ride and extort Mapa

38
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.480
Wahib.

39
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.660
But what you can do over here is that you can use Dag's over here.

40
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.400
So instead of this operation on a hill, what you can do is that you have to ride in.

41
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.390
This marks over here, just create the tax for the steam.

42
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.650
And if you are any kind of familiar with XHTML, then you know that there is this option one to help

43
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.230
dog that can be used.

44
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.650
You specify interpolation of a whatever that is going to store this very Bedwyr since we are using these

45
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.280
quotation marks.

46
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.180
So that's why we have to use interpolation over here and down here.

47
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.330
What you can do is that you can just close on these stacks.

48
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.270
So it is right and this option will help.

49
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.430
And all you have to do down here is just right in front hoppity around the school, and you can see

50
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.450
that each element of the area has been coated in these bags over here.

51
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.280
And since the map function, it is the property of it that it performs the operation on each of the

52
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.730
elements in the area that has been.

53
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.970
Specified with it, so that's why you can see that you have got bags with each element to help.

54
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.010
So Map returned a new area, leaving the original area unmodified.

55
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.270
But if you use the map with the exclamation mark, that would modify the existing area as well.

56
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:59.050
And remember, that map has an alias method called Collects, and you could be consistent and use one

57
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.560
or the other in your code.

58
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.880
Now, since MAP returns a new area, that array can then be transformed and manipulated further or even

59
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.500
converted into a string.

60
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.220
And that is what is the part of the next tutorial.

61
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.940
So for this tutorial, that's it.

62
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.290
You now know how to use the map function in the simplest way possible.

63
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.230
So in the next drill, we will see more on this.

64
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.650
So I guess that's administrator.

65
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.190
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

66
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.100
And I'll see you guys in the next redrill.
