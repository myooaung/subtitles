00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.630
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.290
This is American and welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.070
So here are we are starting on with a new section.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.830
And in this section, what we are going to do is that we are going to download the compiler for Ruby

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.650
and we are going to set up the environment.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.660
We are going to use that is going to be the ATM.

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.570
So starting on with the downloading of the setup, will you have to do is that you have to just go on

8
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.880
to your browser window and you have to go on to this website that is Ruby installer dot org slash downloads.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.210
And when you go on to this website, you will see a series of links that says With death, good without

10
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.050
death, good.

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.630
And a lot of others.

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.990
So what do you have to do is that you have to go on to any of these?

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.700
The latest word over here is the Ruby plus Debka two point seven point or dash one.

14
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.780
That is 64 bit system.

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:08.110
So over here, it says that it is recommended that you use Ruby deep, get two point six into 64 installer,

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.880
which is right over here.

17
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.730
So I'm going to be using this one if you want to use this one.

18
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.440
You are surely welcome to use it.

19
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.170
It's going to create no problem.

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.220
But I'm going on with this one, so I'm going to just click on it.

21
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.600
And the download is going to start.

22
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.210
I'm going to click on download now and then I'm going to wait for a setup so that it is downloaded because

23
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.050
it is I wanted to do and be set up.

24
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.440
So when you download, it's finished.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.540
You have to just go on to the download folders.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.940
And in the programs you will see that you have this Rubins troller with the decade that is two one six

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.470
one five.

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.920
That is the Virgin release.

29
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.350
So you are going to just double click it and you have to accept the license.

30
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.020
You got no other choice.

31
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.570
Just click next and just click on it as well.

32
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.100
Just click on Next again.

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.700
And the setup is preparing to install Ruby and as watched as to on your computer.

34
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.470
All right, so our setup has now been completed and you have to remain this box as check, which says

35
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.310
that run our EDEK installed to set up WMS wires to end development toolchain.

36
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.960
Ms.

37
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.430
Vaastu is required to install Jem's with the extension.

38
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:30.170
So you have to remain in check and just click on Finish and it is going to launch the CMT back for you

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.440
with certain options that are going to just pop in a second.

40
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.820
All right.

41
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:43.010
So it says Ruby Installer two for Windows, and it is asking now for the option which can potentially

42
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.640
be installed.

43
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.560
And it is giving you three options.

44
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.320
The first one, says Mswati, as to base installation.

45
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.400
The second one is Mazwai HESTA system, a date that is optional.

46
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.400
And the third one is Mazwai HESTA and M and UW Development Toolchain.

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.550
Now, the previous dayme installed it.

48
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.280
I did it with this option of a three, but it generated some errors because some of the system updates

49
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.830
were not available because I did not run this option.

50
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.900
So the best option over here is to run all the three of these.

51
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.920
So just click on one click enter.

52
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.220
And wait, while the base installation for this setup is completed.

53
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.010
It will take some time because it is basically extracting each and every folder that has been downloaded

54
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.270
in the previous case and it is going to install it from the very start.

55
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.320
And then what we are going to do is that we are going to go with option number two that deals with the

56
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.400
system a bit.

57
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.090
And then finally, we are going to be going on with the MSCI as to am I and GW Development Toolchain

58
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.130
and basically the M I and GW development toolchain is what is the most important of all of our help.

59
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.050
All right, so the first installation is completed and it says that Mazwai still seems to be properly

60
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.590
installed, it is giving you a warning message, that discussion.

61
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.710
This is the first time of Mswati, as do you, must restart Shell to apply necessary actions.

62
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.360
We will restart that in later.

63
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.310
You just type in two because one is now completed, this one with two for the system update.

64
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.750
It is optional, but it is best for you to go on with it so that any kind of system update is missing

65
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.600
for Mazwai S2 that is going to be installed.

66
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.400
And what it is going to do is it is going to check in the package database.

67
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.110
As you can see that it is saying that synchronising package database's, it is searching and it is going

68
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.090
to install and update any kind of system update that is required for Ms.

69
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.440
Flyest.

70
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.590
True.

71
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.230
That is not present in your system.

72
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.840
All right, so the system modules have been updated.

73
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.740
It took a long time because it was a very lengthy process.

74
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.370
A lot of things here were upgraded.

75
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.170
So now let's go on with the option number three.

76
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.200
Just click on three.

77
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.020
That is the Mazwai S2 and am I and GW Development Toolchain.

78
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.360
So it is also going to take some time.

79
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.070
All right.

80
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.220
It is completed, I guess.

81
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.730
So now we have got all the three of these completed and we have completed them successfully, as you

82
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.900
have seen the succeeded message with all three of them.

83
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:33.910
So now basically, Ruby is installed on our systems now to check on your system that if it is available

84
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.430
and if it is installed successfully or not, if you want to just verify it, just go on to the search

85
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.440
button ivancich and that will open the command prompt for you on the command prompt.

86
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.240
But you have to do is just right in Ruby.

87
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.590
Hyphen, we click enter, and it is going to give you the version that is installed on your system,

88
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.850
so on my system it says Ruby two point six point fifty one one four.

89
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:07.880
And as you can see that it has this amazing GW, all the 64 bit system over here as well.

90
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.350
So this means that Ruby is now successfully installed on my systems.

91
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.390
Now you have all the configurations for Ruby to one six point five on your system, now what you need

92
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.890
is a text editor.

93
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.910
So the text editor we are going to be using is named as Adam.

94
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.430
Adam is basically a free and open source text and source, of course, editor for almost all the kind

95
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.950
of systems you want to work on, maybe the Mac operating system, maybe the Lennix or it be the Microsoft

96
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.460
Windows.

97
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:45.210
It has the support for the plugins that are written in notebooks and embedded git control that is developed

98
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.380
by the GitHub.

99
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.550
So Adam is a desktop application that is built using the Web technologies, so.

100
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.890
To install Adam on your system, where you're going to do is that just go on here, just dive in.

101
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.470
Adam, Dotti, all click, enter.

102
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:10.190
And this website is going to pop up and all you have to do is that you just click on download and this

103
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.010
is the campell compatibility.

104
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.900
It is for a 64 bit for Windows seven non-literary.

105
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.310
Just click on download now.

106
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.460
And the downloading process or the atom is going to start on, which is basically going to be the text

107
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.530
editor for who recording, so it is a heavy set of that is 179 country movies.

108
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.030
That is going to take some time.

109
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.720
So now the Edem Saddam is installed successfully and in the downloads programs folder, you can see

110
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.290
here that I have got a 64 bit Saddam of the atom, so I just double click on it.

111
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.510
All right.

112
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.880
So the atom set up is now running.

113
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.070
It says that atom is being installed and it will launch once it is done.

114
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.320
So it will take some time.

115
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.150
So I will just pause the video here.

116
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.120
And when it is completed, I'll just go on and continue with this video.

117
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.770
All right, so the atom is now being successfully installed on your system just below this, and it

118
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.280
is asking you to open a project, virgin control, collaborate, install a package, choose a team,

119
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.270
customize the styling, hack on the A script.

120
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.970
So this is basically the atom compiler we are going to be using for Obama will be coding.

121
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:32.020
So I will make you friendly with this compiler and we will be installing the atom runner as well on

122
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.080
this compiler, which is basically a package.

123
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.550
And we will be doing that in the next tutorial, I guess of what this tutorial.

124
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:46.750
I hope you have successfully also installed Adam as well as there will be two point six point five on

125
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.770
your systems.

126
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.830
If you have any kind of problem, do let me know.

127
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.150
I'll help you out.

128
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.680
So I guess that's it.

129
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.330
Would destroy studio.

130
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.990
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

131
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.030
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
