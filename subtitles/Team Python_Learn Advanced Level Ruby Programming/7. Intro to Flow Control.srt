Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:07,180
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another Dooralong on this course, on Ruby, and in this part

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,170
of the section we will talk about the flood control in Ruby.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,960
Now, we will define several methods that will enable us to control the flow of Ruby program.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,740
Conditionals and loops alter the flow of Ruby program conditionals are the key words that execute a

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:30,790
certain statement under a specific condition, whereas loops are the block of programs that are executed

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,630
multiple times.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,710
Now, when you run a program, the statements are going to get executed from the top of the source file

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,070
to the bottom one by one in a sequential order.

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,720
Now, if you talk about some of the flow controls, you have them right on your screens, starting on

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,700
with the F, which is a conditional statement.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,470
Then we have else and else which are used in combination with the Elseworlds.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,550
Then we have the case statement, which is also, again, a conditional flow control and we have the

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,870
until, which is a key word.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,730
Then we have the break, which is also going to control the flow of code.

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,590
Then we have the volume, then we have the for loop, then we have the each which is again used in combination

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,800
almost with four, and it makes also a loop.

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,960
Then we have the next and then we have the ruby.

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,460
Do you.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:29,320
So all of these basically are key words which are going to control the flow of your code and how it

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,080
is going to control the flow of your code that you are going to see on from the next drill, where we

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,190
will discuss all of these in detail one by one.

23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,110
So that's it with this drill.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,990
Thank you so much, guys.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,950
We're watching and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
