Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,620
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another detail on this course on Ruby, and this is basically

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,980
going to be the last tutorial in which we will be discussing about operators.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,530
And in this drill, we will be discussing about operators, presidents and Ruby.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,560
Now, we have already covered operators, presidents and Ruby, but that was a very, very, very brief

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,180
introduction now in this story.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,510
And what I've done is that I almost added every operator and I have actually categorized them as well.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:37,740
So starting on with the description part, the first and the utmost precedence is given to the constant

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,500
resolution operator that is represented with the double calling, which we have discussed just in the

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,490
previous drill.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,460
Then we have the element reference and the element set operator.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,000
Now you can see on the left side, then we have the exponentiation that is for the double starick.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,940
Then we have the not the complement, the unary plus and minus that are basically the method.

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:10,590
Names for the last two are plus at and minus and then we have the multiply, divide and modulo.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,260
Then we have the normal addition and subtraction.

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:21,320
Then we have the right and left bitwise ship, then we have the bitwise and then we have the bitwise

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,380
exclusive are and regular are, then we have the comparison operators, then we have the equality and

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,090
Bacterin match operators.

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,100
Then we have the logical and then we have the logical ah.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,490
Then we have the range operators that include both inclusive and exclusive and then we have the ternary

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,220
if then else then we have the assignment then we have to check if specified.

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,850
Simbo define which we have also covered in the previous tutorial.

23
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,880
Then we have the logical negation, then we have the logical composition.

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:03,410
So the previous operator presidents we have covered we do then we have not covered all the operators,

25
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,860
but now since we have covered all the operators.

26
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,860
So I found it necessary to cover the Operator Precedent's again.

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,060
And I think that you would have understand Operator Precedent's very much now than before.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,680
So I guess that's it with this tutorial as well.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,550
And that's it with the introduction to operators as well and Ruby.

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,470
So that's it with this tutorial as well.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,180
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,580
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
