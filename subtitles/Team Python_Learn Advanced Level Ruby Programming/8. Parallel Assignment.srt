Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,950
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to an editorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,880
In this tutorial, we are going to be covering a very interesting topic that is about parallel assignment.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,470
Now, Ruby supports the parallel assignment of variables which can be done in a single operation, and

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,800
therefore you can declare several variables to the left as an assignment operator and several variables,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,250
several values to the right, which are going to be treated as the values to the operator, as you have

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,280
just specified to the left of the order of the values to the right must be the same to the variables

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,910
on the left.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,590
So let's just go to a very quick example for this, and then I guess that will be more easy to understand.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:53,580
So I just want to add to more here and let's say I want to specify three variables and assign three

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,270
values to it.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,650
For example, I want to let's just say that I want to use a then I want to specify be the one to specify

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,690
C, and I want to make them equal to, let's say, Ruby.

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,890
And a coma.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,670
Tutorials.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,810
And let's say the third one is instructor.

17
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,930
So if I just now print all of these one by one puts a.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,680
Both B and C and just press all plus R, then you can see that it has printed me all of these Scruby

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,770
tutorials and instructors.

20
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:42,720
So instead of just doing a sequel to Ruby and then on the next line be equal to Oriels and then on the

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,800
next third line writing sequel to Instructor, you can just use the concept of parallel assignment,

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,520
which is supported by Ruby, and you can assign all these three values, the values in a single line,

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
which is basically called parallel assignment.

24
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,680
So the order of the execution here is very important.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,690
Now, whatever the first value over here is, it is going to be assigned the first value, which is

26
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,450
quite easy to understand, I guess.

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,020
And the last one is going to be given the lost value and so on.

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,270
If you have any number of values, the sequence is going to be followed.

29
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,540
Now, what's important about here is that if there are three values over here, it is much that you

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,320
have three values over here or else it is going to generate error.

31
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:32,640
For example, if I just remove one from here or plus R, then you can see that it has only given me

32
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,190
the first two that it puts and puts me because C was given no kind of value.

33
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,370
Now, for example, just specify a comb, our hair, all our hair, then it is going to give me an error

34
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,570
because I have specified some special hair, but I haven't specified any value now.

35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,190
But if I just simply put this.

36
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,020
Quotation marks will here, all plus are then it is going to give me some output because now it is going

37
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,110
to treat this as nothing of value that is equal to nothing.

38
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:12,130
So basically a value is given, but that is nothing to that's what a simple space is pretty dry to here,

39
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,250
as you can see on the output screen and both be dead.

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,680
Nothing.

41
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,940
So if you can specify some value again, that was I guess to Dorio see as it was.

42
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,260
And plus all plus are all the three values are right over here.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,070
So that is basically the concept of parallel assignment, which I guess was very simple to understand.

44
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,560
So I guess that's this tutorial as well.

45
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,140
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

46
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,910
And I'll see you guys in the next Attrill.
