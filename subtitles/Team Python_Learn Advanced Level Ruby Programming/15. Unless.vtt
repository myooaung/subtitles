00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.230
Hey, guys, what's up this summer, hon, and I welcome you to another Dorelle on this course on Ruby.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.460
And in this tutorial, we are going to see a very special statement that is provided by Ruby and is

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.560
referred as the unless statement.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.790
This statement is executed on the given condition is false.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.310
It is opposite of its statement.

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.730
In its statement, the block executes once the given condition is true, however, and unless statement

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.040
the block of code executes once the given condition is false and the statement is used when we are required

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.150
to print false condition, we cannot use if statement and our operator to print false statements because

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.670
if statement and our operator or this work on true condition.

10
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.500
So if you talk about the syntax of this, you can see it right over here.

11
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.220
You have unless you are, then you have to write in the condition.

12
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.640
At which if you want that, you want certain statements to get executed, if that condition is false

13
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.270
and you can help us with it if you want to, but that is also optional.

14
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.560
So if you want that, if condition is true, then you want some statements to get executed.

15
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
So you have to write and else and you have to write in the statements you want to execute and then it

16
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
is terminated by the end you work.

17
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640
Then if you talk about the flow of go to hell.

18
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.950
So this is basically the flowchart for that.

19
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.650
It starts on, then it checks the condition.

20
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.230
If the condition is false, as I told you, since it is opposite of conditions, so the condition is

21
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.450
false, it is going to execute the code.

22
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.030
That is the only score, as you can see right over here.

23
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.590
Then if the condition is true, you can have an alarm clock and that code is going to get executed and

24
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.800
after that it is going to come out and in both cases, the after unlaced code is going to get executed,

25
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.890
which means that it is going to exit from that block of unless and it is going to execute everything

26
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.390
after that.

27
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.960
And then finally, it is going to end.

28
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.800
So I guess let's go to some examples and that will be done much more easier to understand.

29
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.560
So I'll move on to Adam.

30
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.450
And in here we will write a very simple code in which we will only print a certain, let's say something

31
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.440
like Hello World, or let's say something like my name.

32
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.830
So you can have a variable, let's say X equal to one.

33
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.900
And what you want is that you want to specify an unlisted mint.

34
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.190
That says X is greater than four.

35
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.250
So what you can do is that you can ride in boats.

36
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.740
Hello, world.

37
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.220
And after that, what you can do is that you can specify the Earth's condition and in the Earth's condition,

38
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.840
you can just write and put.

39
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.010
Hello ls so it is going to ride in the hello's, which means that our blog is going to get executed

40
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.220
and simply you are going to write in end or help.

41
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.270
So if I just run the code.

42
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.040
It is combining and as you can see, that it is printed out.

43
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.580
Hello.

44
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.180
Well, in our case, because this condition of our here is false because one is not greater than four.

45
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.100
What if this condition was not true?

46
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.880
For example, if I just initialize this to five?

47
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.710
So now this condition is true.

48
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.900
So but now run this code, you can see that it has printed out.

49
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.560
How else?

50
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.410
Because this condition over here is true.

51
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.840
And as I told you, that this is what is basically opposite of the if condition.

52
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.900
So that's why this scorable here that is in the unless block is going to get executed, if this condition

53
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.300
over here, which we have specified, is false.

54
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.460
So in the previous case, when the X was equal to one, this condition or here was false.

55
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.500
So we got HelloWallet printed out and in the second case, when this X was equal to five.

56
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.120
So this condition was then true.

57
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.370
So this court is going to get skipped and the else block is going to get executed and Halliwells is

58
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.960
going to get printed on your screen.

59
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.070
So this was the simplest explanation and the simplest example of how you can use that unless you work

60
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.390
in your Ruby code.

61
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.710
Now, you can also use unless as a modifier to modify an expression when you use, unless is a modifier

62
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:23.160
or the left hand side behave as a then condition and the right hand side behave as a test condition.

63
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.700
So to start on with the simplest example of how you can use unless as a modifier, we will just remove

64
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.550
this code from here.

65
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.230
We even have a variable X equal to, let's say, zero.

66
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.560
And then what we can write in that we can write the condition as well as the statement in a very single

67
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.830
line.

68
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.420
So let's say the statement is X plus equal to two, so X equal to X plus two is going to get executed

69
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.050
if this condition we specify after this unlucky word is false.

70
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.210
So let's say the condition is B dot zero.

71
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.920
So as you can see that this condition over here is true, right, an ex for him.

72
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.770
So this condition over here is true because the value of X is zero.

73
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:13.300
So this means that this condition over here is not going to get executed because we have X equal to

74
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.630
zero.

75
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.290
So since this condition is true.

76
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.130
So, as you know that unless it does not execute a set of statements, if a condition is true, it executes

77
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.840
a set of statement of a condition is false.

78
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.900
So after that, what we can simply write in that we can write in puts X run this code.

79
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.250
And as you can see, that it has printed out zero in our case because this condition of here was true.

80
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.260
So this statement does not get executed.

81
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.340
Now, let's say we have something that is not zero.

82
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.060
So let's say I just write in three, I run the score and as you can see, that I have got five for him.

83
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.550
This is because this condition was not false and since this condition was false.

84
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.590
So this statement over here is going to get executed.

85
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.230
X is going to equal to X plus two.

86
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.210
So it is going to equal to three plus two.

87
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.570
That is going to make it five.

88
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.430
And when I write in X over here, it is going to print five for me.

89
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:16.670
So that's how basically you can also use unless as a modifier to modify an expression, so I guess that's

90
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.800
it, that's how you can use unless you are normally and you can use unlet, skewered as a modifier.

91
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.860
So that's it with this tutorial.

92
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.710
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

93
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.020
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
