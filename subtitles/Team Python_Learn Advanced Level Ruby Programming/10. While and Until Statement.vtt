00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.280
Hey, guys, what's up this summer, and I welcome you to another story on this course on Rubaiyat and

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.620
this tutorial we are going to be covering to statement the first one in the wild statement, and then

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.160
we are going to be discussing the key word.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.800
So starting on with a wise statement, the vital statement is a controlled flow statement that allows

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.950
the car to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition, how it executes the good while

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.680
the condition is true, the while he would execute the statement inside the lock enclosed by that and

7
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.080
key word and the statements are executed each time the expression is to be true.

8
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.060
So if you talk about the syntax of the world condition, you can see it right.

9
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.380
Here you have the wild word up to the one key word.

10
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.550
You have to specify the condition which is going to be checked.

11
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.480
Then you are going to specify the statements you want to execute in the wild condition is true.

12
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.470
You're also going to have an incremental or decremental counter type of something that is going to make

13
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.990
the condition false at some instance, because if you don't have something like that, then the condition

14
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
is always going to be true and the loop is never going to be on.

15
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.260
And it is also called a never ending value.

16
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.410
So you can see one more thing.

17
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.220
So here is the Dukey word.

18
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.920
Now, this Dukey word is basically optional.

19
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.650
If you don't want to specify it, don't do it.

20
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.410
But if you want to, you can always have it.

21
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.830
Now, the second key word is our until statement, and if you talk about the syntax of this, it is

22
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.540
very simple.

23
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.740
You have to write until you have to write in the condition and then you have to write in the statements

24
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.150
you want to execute.

25
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.230
And the until it's also a control statement which executes the code.

26
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.760
While the condition is false, the loop stops when the condition is true.

27
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.120
So to talk on with some examples of both of these.

28
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.090
Let's move on to our.

29
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:17.150
I did over here, so we will start on with the example of the loofahs, so let's say we have a variable

30
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.090
that is AI that is equal to, let's say zero.

31
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.320
And that is what is called the initialization part.

32
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.740
And you are going to have the initialization for the while loop right over here.

33
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.220
And then let's say we are having one more variable that is some equal to zero.

34
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.790
Now we will have a while loop and after the one, we have to specify the condition.

35
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.880
So we are going to specify the condition that while AI is less than 10.

36
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.160
So while AI is less than then what we want to do is.

37
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.430
That we will have, let's say I equal to.

38
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.090
I plus one.

39
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.150
All right, then finally, we are going to ride in some equal to.

40
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.290
Someplace I.

41
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.650
And finally, after this wild look and what we are going to do is we are going to ride in boats.

42
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.050
The sum from.

43
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.830
Zero to nine.

44
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.990
Is.

45
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.810
Whatever is stored in the same variable now, the good example, we have basically calculated the sum

46
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.720
of values from a range of numbers.

47
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.450
Now, the loop over here has three parts.

48
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.240
The first is the initialization part.

49
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.070
Then we have the testing part and then we have the updating.

50
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.270
But now since while is a loop, so therefore we will have a certain set of statement executed again

51
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.720
and again.

52
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.170
And each execution of the statement is going to be called a cycle.

53
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.000
Now, in here you can see that we have the two initialization equal to zero and some equal to zero.

54
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.160
So we have initiated the eye and the sum variable.

55
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.310
Then we will have a counter variable in which we have selected this, i.e. equal to zero, which is

56
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.920
going to be called as the counter.

57
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.110
Then we have the while loop in which we have specified the condition that while it is less than 10,

58
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.420
what do you have to do is that you have to execute this set statement and then you have to simply.

59
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.290
And so the expression between the vial and the doki work is the second phase that is called as the testing

60
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.800
phase.

61
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.680
Now, you have to know the ahead that the Dukey word is optional, the statements in the room the body

62
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.460
are going to execute until the expression is evaluated to false and how it is going to be done.

63
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.190
That is going to be the third phase of the value that is called updating this and which is right over

64
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.400
here.

65
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.170
That is equal to a plus one.

66
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.520
So this third phase is basically called updating.

67
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.360
We increment the counter.

68
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.710
Now, if you don't specify this counter over here, then what it is going to do is that it is going

69
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.090
to keep on repeating because if you don't increment the value of EI, which is zero at start.

70
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.000
So this conditional here is going to be always, always true.

71
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.080
And whatever you specify over here is going to execute again and again and again again.

72
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.350
And it is never going to stop.

73
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.660
And it is also going to be called a never ending value.

74
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.580
So you have to specify some kind of counter that is called a definition of the counter.

75
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.070
So we have this I incremented right O'Haire.

76
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.630
So every time this loop is basically it's it complete one of its cycles, the value of is going to be

77
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.270
increment it for Fuscus it is going to equal to zero then it is going to execute for equal to a plus

78
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.660
one then for do then I three i4 and finally it is going to identify what then this condition is going

79
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.870
to what it is going to come out and it is going to print the same party.

80
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.280
So I just run this code.

81
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.890
You can see that it says the sum from zero to nine is fifty five.

82
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.650
You can just calculated on the paper if you want to or you can just trust your editor.

83
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.950
Right.

84
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.490
Or help.

85
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:19.000
So this is how basically a while loop goes on and you're going to use loop a lot in the future tutorial,

86
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.710
so I suggest that you just grab it right over here when I'm talking.

87
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:32.120
So the second part of the tutorial deals with the until key word which executes the code until and unless

88
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.480
the condition is false and it is going to stop when the condition becomes true.

89
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.880
So, for example, let's just remove this from here.

90
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.920
So let's say we have a variable.

91
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.450
Let's say Dayme.

92
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.320
And this time, variable is equal to, let's say, 20 for.

93
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.880
So just remove it from here as well, and we are going to.

94
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.490
Have the key words, we are going to adjourn until.

95
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.050
Time equal, equal to zero, what it is going to do is that it is going to say that if.

96
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.790
Time equal, equal to one, it is going to say that.

97
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.670
There is.

98
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.120
All right, so just going to say there is hashtag time, which is going to be one, so it is going to

99
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.950
say there is one hour left so you can just write an hour left, not hours left.

100
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.100
And if it is something else than that, it is going to be either from two to 24 or so.

101
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.690
It is going to say El's.

102
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.700
It is going to put.

103
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.270
There are.

104
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.900
This much time.

105
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.780
Left, that is going to specify the time and it is going to say hours left.

106
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.400
And finally, what you're going to do is that you are going to write in the end statement here.

107
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:26.550
And I guess you can just run this code now, all right, so it says it has got some syntax error that

108
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.120
is expected, end of input, expecting and.

109
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:36.960
All right, if we have not specified the end for this, if statements, you have to specify if and who

110
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.420
are here for this if statement.

111
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.830
So this is going to be the law for the statement.

112
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.690
And this is basically the blog for the under statement in which this end is for this until and this.

113
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:51.060
And as for this statement of well, and also, yes, you have to specify the counter, because if you

114
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.590
don't specify the counter, then this is also going to be a never ending loop.

115
00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:01.440
So you're going to also write in time equal to time minus one.

116
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:09.430
So time is going to be decremental each time since we want it to start on from 24 and gone to zero.

117
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.230
So I guess it's good looking.

118
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.530
Let's just run it on.

119
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.240
As you can see that it says there are 24 hours left, there are 23 hours left.

120
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.370
And so until you do twenty one and go on, go on, go on to one hour left.

121
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.100
So it is going to finally say there are there is one hour left.

122
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.710
So just rerun it so that it is much more aligned.

123
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.170
Now it looks more beautiful.

124
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:33.970
All right.

125
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.790
So for this, it also again has three parts.

126
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.650
The first one is the initialization part in which we have initialized a variable that is time equal

127
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.480
to 24.

128
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.690
Then we have a checking condition, which is right here in which we have.

129
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:56.110
Right, and until time equal, equal to zero, and in that we have also specified and if condition in

130
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.770
which we have.

131
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.850
Written that if Democratico wants, it is going to say there is and if it is greater than one and so

132
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.920
it is going to say there are this much hours left for this, it is going to be ours because we have

133
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:16.510
used our hill for is it is going to be something else then as as just a basic English concept.

134
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.740
And then this is the end statement.

135
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:26.720
And then this is the third part that is basically something that decrements the counter so that this

136
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.170
until and somewhere.

137
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.990
So finally, this is the end statement for this onto the keyboard.

138
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.060
And this is what is the output that is going to be generated after all this.

139
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.490
So I guess that's it with the two key words.

140
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.600
I hope you have understood them because they are going to be used a lot in the future.

141
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.560
Advanced durians.

142
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.500
So that's what this tutorial.

143
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.520
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

144
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.310
And I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
