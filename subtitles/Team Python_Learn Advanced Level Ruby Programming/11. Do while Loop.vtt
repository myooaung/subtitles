00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.510
Hey, guys, what's up this time around?

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.210
And I welcome you to another tutorial on discourse on Rowby.

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.420
And in this tutorial, we are going to be covering the Dubai loop.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.930
The Dubai loop works in a similar way to Awilo.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.720
What important difference between the two is that the core within the loop get executed one time prior

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.140
to the condition check to see if the code should be executed or not.

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.510
In a do I look the condition a check is placed at the end of the loop as opposed to the beginning,

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.090
where in a while loop it is placed.

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.750
So let's see the syntax for that.

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.010
Now it has the almost the very syntax, but the only difference is that it starts on with the key word

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.820
loop.

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.850
You have to write in do then you have to write in the statement to execute.

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.670
Then you have to use in the break your word and you have to write in the boolean expression a health.

14
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.140
Now, if you just examine the difference were held in the Y loop, we would have written the condition

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.090
right over here and then we would have these statements executed over here.

16
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.760
So in the do I look, even if this condition over here is false, even then the statements are going

17
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.710
to execute once.

18
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.340
But for the while loop, if the condition is false, the statements are not going to be executed even

19
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.680
once.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.370
So that is what is the basic difference between a value and a do while loop.

21
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.730
So let's see the difference between the wall and the wall with the help of an example.

22
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.490
So, all right, let's say we want to do something like.

23
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.130
Driton Loopt, attriting do to just click, enter, and you have to write and put.

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.550
This is a dual.

25
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.590
Lou, and you have to write in, let's say, a number here.

26
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.380
And we will initialize a number at the top here.

27
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.270
To zero, and then over here we will increment this number.

28
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.940
No, you could do no plus one.

29
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.070
Now, after this is done, what we are going to do is that we are going to.

30
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.690
The conditional checks we are going to write in if.

31
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.710
No, equal, equal to zero.

32
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.170
Then what it is going to do is that it is going to simply break or let's say just write a number equal

33
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.300
equal to one, because at the start this number is zero.

34
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.060
It is going to increment that number.

35
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.150
And after that, it should be equal to one or less if you just remove this from here.

36
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.760
Based at O'Hare, then we can just go on with zero hail.

37
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.590
All right, so we have this, so now all we need to do is that we already have ended this, so let's

38
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.550
just run this code.

39
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.540
All right, so it says it needs one more a hill, and that is for this if.

40
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.210
All right, now, let's run this ad, as you can see, that it says this is a do I look and this is

41
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.960
the attrition.

42
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.320
So as you can see, that the condition is already false.

43
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.860
So this slope should not have even worked once because as you can see, that it says that if no equal

44
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.020
equal to zero, it it should have just Brigden from this and ended.

45
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.550
But as you can see that it has executed one because the statements are the top and since it is going

46
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.820
to follow a sequential order.

47
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.420
So that's why this statement over here is going to execute once and after that the condition is going

48
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.870
to be checked.

49
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.700
So if this was, let's say, one of wahib, you should have run it and it should have run then twice

50
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.510
for the first time, the condition should have been true, that it should have went back.

51
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.760
It should have done this again.

52
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.420
But for the second case, the condition was false because number was one.

53
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.110
But as I told you that after the condition get false in the duel, the statements are going to execute

54
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.940
one more time after that as well.

55
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.080
But for example, you use the Vilaboa here.

56
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.950
And for that, you have to specify the condition right over here, that if.

57
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.360
While no.

58
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.010
Is greater than.

59
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.920
One, what it should do all is just make it equal to zero.

60
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.040
So we're going to just right and this is why, Luke.

61
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.470
And we are going to just remove this from here, a number equal to number plus one and run this and

62
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.310
as you can see that.

63
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.950
It did not even work once, so that is what is the basic difference between.

64
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:57.130
A while and do I look in reality programming language, so I guess you have understood the working of

65
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.520
a do I loop and you also have understood the basic difference between a value and a do while loop as

66
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.770
well.

67
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.350
So that's it with the strategy.

68
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.890
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
