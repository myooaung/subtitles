Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.910
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to editorial on this course on Ruby and in this area.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.360
We are going to be covering one more function on range.

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.330
That is the member function.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.440
The member is an invalid method in Ruby that returns a boolean value.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
True of the given object lies within the given range of it is going to return false.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.520
Then it has a very simple syntax.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.610
You have to just write in the ranch dot member a question mark and in the bracket it is going to accept

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.760
one parameter, which is going to be the object which you have to check for.

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.100
So let's see a very simple example of member function.

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.150
So let's move on to Adam and and here we are going to see a very simple example.

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.110
So, as usual, we are going to define a range from zero to nine and we are going to have a variable,

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.320
let's say S. And we are going to write in range.

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Don't remember a question mark.

15
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.600
And let's say we want to check for five.

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.980
Just right in votes as well here on this, and it is going to return true, as you can see, that it

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.040
works in the very same fashion as they include function.

18
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.600
So this is the second rail how to check if a certain number exists between a certain range or not.

19
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.940
For example, if you just ride in, let's say Denis O'Hare underscored as simple as that, it is going

20
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.810
to return false.

21
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.300
So this works the very same way as the include function.

22
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.250
And this is basically the second way to check if a number exists between a certain range or not.

23
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.970
So I guess that's what the story is.

24
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.360
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

25
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.640
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
