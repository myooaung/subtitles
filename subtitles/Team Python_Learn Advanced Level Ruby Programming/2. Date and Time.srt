00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,470
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,850
This is American, and I welcome you to a new drill here on discourse, on religion.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,600
In this tutorial, we are going to start on a date and time.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,210
So in Ruby, we have the time class that represents the dates and times.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,220
It is a thin layer or the system date and time functionality provided by the operating system.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,160
Now, this really will make you familiar with almost all the vaunted concepts that are related to date

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,610
and time.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,560
So let's start on with how to get the current date and the current time.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,840
So to do it, there are basically two methods.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,490
The first one is using the new and the second one is using the null function.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,150
So let's say you have an object over here.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,080
So let's say the name of the object is time one and you just write in time.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,080
And as I told you that this time Ohare is the class which is going to be used to get the time.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,450
So you're going to write in time Dot knew.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,810
And what time Dot New is going to do is that it is going to get you the time and downhill.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,070
When you just ride in boats.

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,030
And let's say you say the current.

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:19,050
Time is interpellation and right in here, are you right in time, one dot inspect, so if you just

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,860
run this code.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,660
You're going to see that it says the current time is 2020, 05, 03, you can see that this is the dead,

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,360
this is the time and this is, I guess, the formidable hill.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,560
So this was basically the first method of how to get the current time in Ruby.

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:47,010
Now, the second method is using the no method, and that is something like time to equal to time dot

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,570
now.

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,550
And in that you are going to write in votes.

26
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,320
Current time is.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,580
And you are going to use the time to object now and you are going to write an INS.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,460
Back around the squad and you can see that it has generated the now time, as you can see, that it

29
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,240
has the second time that has been generated using the now.

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,820
So these are the two method using which you can just get the current date and the current time.

31
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,390
Now, there are certain components that are associated with dead.

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,510
And so how to get the components of a date and time.

33
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,020
So for that, you can also use the time object to get various components of date and time to show you

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,430
how that is going to be done.

35
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,440
Let's just remove this stuff from here and you can see that you have an object over here.

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
That is time.

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,890
And we have created it using the new method.

38
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,080
Well, here now to get the components of a time, what you can just write and you can just for example,

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,020
if you want to get the year of the date, you can just write in time, dot your around this code and

40
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,570
you can see that you have got the year for this.

41
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,670
That is 20/20.

42
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:05,410
And now let's say you want to get the months so that you can just write in votes time, dot month on

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,830
this and you can see that you have generated the man that is the fifth month.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,920
Then to get the day you are going to just write in time.

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,540
Dot, they run this.

46
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,260
All right, you have to write in what's with it as well.

47
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,070
And I'll run it.

48
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,990
And you can see that it has generated there.

49
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,440
That is the third day of the fifth month of twenty twenty.

50
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:30,970
Then for example, if you want to know the week, it is so far that you have to write in votes.

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,340
I'm not there, that stands for the weekday, and it is going to tell you that which day of the week

52
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,580
is going on, if you just run it, you can see that it is zero, which means that today is Sunday.

53
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,560
So that's why it has generated zero here.

54
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,940
Then, for example, if you want to know the year of the day that which day of the year is going on,

55
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,370
you can just write in first time dot y day that stands for the zero day rallies.

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,340
And you can see that it is the one 24th day of this year, 2020, that is going on.

57
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,010
And if you want to know the hours, what you can do is that you can simply write in Dot Harward, Time

58
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,000
Ronda's and you can see that it is the 22nd hour, which means that it's it is 10:00 at 9:00 night time.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,960
This at this moment right now then if you want to know the minute and you can just write in time dot.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,220
MINUT Ronda's, and you can see that it is the fifty fourth minute or ten, which means that the time

61
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,790
now is 20 to 54 and if you want to know the seconds, you can also do that using the time object.

62
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,130
You can just write in time dot s.E.C.

63
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,620
That's tenth or second round the score.

64
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,750
You can see that it is the fifty fourth second.

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,900
If you rerun this code you can see that now it is 48.

66
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,580
You can see that the seconds has changed.

67
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,590
All right.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,520
If you want to know the microsecond you can also do that or they are just right in time dot you seconds

69
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,750
where you stand for micro Ronda's and you can see that, you can also see the one four zero one nine.

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,580
All right.

71
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,720
So this is the microsecond.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,400
And if you want to know the zone as well, you can also do that for this.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
You have to just slide in time, Dot.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,650
Zone around this code and you can see that it is the Pakistan standard time which is going on right

75
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,670
now, which is the zone in which I'm operating.

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,580
So as you have seen the output, you can do a lot of stuff using the time glass, which in which we

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,600
have created an object.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,060
And using that object we can know year demanded the we did you did the are the minute, the second the

79
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,810
microsecond and the zone as well.

80
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:42,110
So the next thing we need to know about time and it is about the time, UTC, the time, GM and the

81
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,960
time that local functions.

82
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,150
So basically these functions can be used to form a date in a standard format.

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,230
So how that is going to be done, let's just remove this from here.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,170
And we are going to write in time dot local and in the local, you are going to pass in certain parameters

85
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,620
and those parameters are basically going to be the year.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,650
Then you have to specify the month and then you have to specify the date.

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:21,830
So let's say the year 2020 and the month is 5th and the date right now is three.

88
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,340
So these are the three parameters which are going to get passed into this local function.

89
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,620
And I guess that's good enough.

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,620
Let's just save it in a variable.

91
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,110
X and down here, just write in votes X or underscored, and you can see that you have got 20 20 zero

92
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,040
five zero three.

93
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,030
You've got this one here and you've got zero five zero zero.

94
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,000
So this is basically the local time at this time.

95
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,780
And then you can also specify more parameters of a hill.

96
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,160
And you can also use the UDC function as well.

97
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,890
So, for example, if I just write in time, DOT, UDC and in the U.S., you also have to pass in certain

98
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,780
arguments.

99
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,450
So those arguments are, let's say the first, then you have to specify the date, then you have to

100
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,820
specify sorry, the month first and then the date.

101
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:22,350
And then you have to specifying the that you have to specify, let's say, the time as well.

102
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,510
So let's say at the time at this time is.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,210
Nine, 20, now run this.

104
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:36,080
All right, we have to output that as well, so let's just right in what you will do time dot UDC and

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,230
now right in Portu I run this and you can see that you have got nine 20 as the time and you can see

106
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,470
that the data is very same.

107
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,570
So right here, since we did not pass the time to the local function.

108
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,180
So that's why the time was zero zero zero zero zero zero.

109
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:55,080
But since in this case, we have lost in the time that is nine 20, this is the ah, this is the minute.

110
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,610
So that's why we have got this.

111
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,150
You can also pass in the seconds, which is going to be the sixth argument of this UTC function as well

112
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,260
as this local function.

113
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,300
So now you must be thinking that what is going to be the format in which these parameters are going

114
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,680
to get passed into this local function and this UTC function.

115
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,330
So all of us remember that you have to start on with seconds, then you have to write in minutes, then

116
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,840
hours.

117
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,430
Then the day than the month.

118
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,520
Than the year, than the weekday than the other day, then the SDD and finally the zone.

119
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:31,470
So if you just remove this from here and let's say you create the time object again, we'll.

120
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:41,430
Dime new and then you're right, and values equal to dime dot to underscore as which means that we are

121
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,720
converting this do not to us but to air, which means that we are converting this to an area.

122
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,280
And right here you just right in the.

123
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,220
Values run this code, you can see that you have got this, so the format I just told you in here,

124
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,920
this is basically the second.

125
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,730
This is the minute.

126
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,470
This is the hour.

127
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,280
This is 22.

128
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,420
This three is the day.

129
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,530
This five is the month.

130
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,400
This is the year.

131
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,950
And after this, this is the weirdest incise.

132
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,140
I told you this is Sunday today.

133
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,860
So that's why it is a zero here.

134
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,940
And this is the year today, which is the 124 day of the year.

135
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,440
Then this is the I as DSD, which is false at this time.

136
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,030
And then we have finally got this zone, which is the Pakistan standard time.

137
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,090
So this is basically the format in which things are going to get executed.

138
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,020
Now, as you can see that you have got an area in which you have got all this stuff over here, so what

139
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,170
you can do is that you can pass this very same area to the time dot UTC or time dot local function instead

140
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,680
of writing that stuff, which we have been passing.

141
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,370
So how that is going to be done is that you have already created this.

142
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,390
Now, right here in place of this, you can just write in votes.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Dime dot UDC and in the parameters you are going to pass in the values, but you have to write and Starick

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,300
as well, values run this code and that is going to generate the things for you.

145
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,910
You can see that you have got the UDC this time as the zone.

146
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,770
You have got twenty three zero zero zero zero seven as the time and you've got this data will help.

147
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,450
Similarly, you can pass it to the local function as well.

148
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,890
You can just write in local law here or on the school board and you can see that it has also generated

149
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,040
some output right over here.

150
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,460
So instead of just passing the parameters and just remembering the format, what you can do is that

151
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:35,150
you can simply store it all those things in an area and then you can pass in that area using these esoteric

152
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,570
object.

153
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:35,810
Right.

154
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,280
Or help.

155
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,020
Then we have the concept of time zones and the Daylight Saving Time also here.

156
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,920
So you can use the time object for that as well to get all the information related to time zones and

157
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,410
daylight savings and how that is going to be done.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,650
Or there's just remote desktop from here.

159
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,820
And as you can see, that you have created the time with the object and now what you can do is that

160
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,200
you can just right in time.

161
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:06,230
Dot zone, and that is going to do your job, just write and post with it Ronda's and you can see that

162
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,490
you have got a zone in which you are operating, the zone in which I am operating as the Pakistan standard

163
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,820
time.

164
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,340
And what you can do is that you can do a lot of stuff more where you can just write in inputs.

165
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:25,380
Time dot, UTC, underscore offset, and if you just run the scoreboard.

166
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:33,320
You can see that you've got this offset and UTC is zero 2nd offset from UTC, so that's why you got

167
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
this eighteen thousand over here.

168
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:45,590
And then what you can do is that you can just now right input's time zone around this code and we already

169
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,250
have done that.

170
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,650
You don't have to do it again.

171
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,830
It has to be as DSD, Ronda's and as you can see, that it was false in the previous case as well as

172
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,780
well as it is now, then you can just see if it is true or not.

173
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,390
If it is true, for example, this will help them.

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,040
If this is true, it is going to return.

175
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,250
True.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,110
But this is not an it is going to return false and it is going to be true if the T is in the UTC time

177
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,370
zone around this.

178
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,380
And as you can see, that it has generated false, which means that the time is not in the UTC.

179
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,250
Formidable Hill.

180
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:23,130
And you can also convert to the local time zone using the local time function, so you can just right

181
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,170
in time dot local time, right in boats with it.

182
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,570
Now, Ronda's you can see that you have got this as the local time, you converted to a local time zone

183
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,560
and you can also convert back to UTC time zone for that.

184
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,460
You have to ride in time.

185
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,870
Don't GM time.

186
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,130
And that is going to do your job right, and post with it.

187
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,970
Now run it and you can see that you have got the UTC time zone now.

188
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,410
Then you can also return a new time object in the local zone, for that you have to write in votes time,

189
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,970
dot.

190
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,500
Get local around the school, and that is going to return something and as you can see, you have got

191
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,360
this output as well.

192
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,520
So more what you can do is that you can also return a new time object in the UDC the same way you have

193
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,440
done it in local.

194
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,560
You will use the very same format you tried and time don't get.

195
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,140
But in place of local, you have to write in UDC Ronda's and now you can see that in place of this you

196
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,380
have got the UDC time zone.

197
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:36,230
So this is the local time zone and this is the universal I guess this is this abbreviation is something

198
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,350
like universal time, something like that.

199
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,220
Then comes the concept of formating times and it's in Ruby.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,030
Now there are various ways to form a time and date.

201
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,650
So how that is going to be done, just remove this from here.

202
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,360
For example, you can convert the time to string four that you already know, a method to convert things

203
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,310
into string that to underscore so you can just slide in both timed out to underscore S Rhondda score,

204
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,030
and that is going to convert your string sorry, your time into string.

205
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,240
And this is the time that has been converted into string.

206
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,370
Then you can also know the current time or that you have the right inputs time dot c time that is going

207
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,720
to print the current time.

208
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,060
Or underscored, and this is Sunday today, the month is May, and you have got three years, the date,

209
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,340
this is the time and this is the year in which you are present.

210
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:38,460
So this has said time is going to just bring the current time along with the day that man time and a

211
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,010
lot of stuff.

212
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,110
So one more is that you can also bring the local time for that.

213
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,540
You have to write in time, dot local time, run this and that is going to bring the local time.

214
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,120
Then you can also have both Stiehm Dot SDR.

215
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,370
Halftime time, so that is going to PRENDA stirring up time and I guess we have got some kind of.

216
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,500
Yes, we have to pause in certain parameters for that as well.

217
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,520
Now, as you can see that your God this time, Abargil, and you have this plus we have got this year

218
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,070
than we have got this month and we have got this did.

219
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,520
So are you going to do that?

220
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,280
You can also tell the format.

221
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,030
You can also change the format in which this these things are going to get appear.

222
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,760
So, for example, we are going to just write in, let's say first we want to know the year before that

223
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm going to write and why.

224
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,380
Then you have to ride the separator, that is going to be a dash, then you have to ride in the months

225
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:40,690
of for that, I want this to show up, then dead separator, then finally the date and just add a space.

226
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,480
And after that, you are going to specify the permit for the time.

227
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,440
So let's say I want to just press the hours and the column is going to be the separator between time

228
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,540
that I want to know the month and the call and that is the separator.

229
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,920
And finally, I want to know the seconds.

230
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,090
Now, I just find it, as you can see, that I've got this output a hill.

231
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:09,010
All right, we have got certain with this this has to be the person did sign, so that's why we have

232
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,620
got this and we're here now.

233
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,510
Run this and you can see that now we have got the things in the format you liked.

234
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,840
Now you can also change the format as well, for example.

235
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,730
And this will help you first.

236
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,770
Want to know the date, let's say.

237
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,440
And after that, you want to know the month.

238
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,310
And up to that you want to know the year so you can just change it.

239
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,170
Now, run this and you can see that now you've got was the date, then the month and then the year.

240
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:39,410
So this staff time is going to help you to set the things according to your needs.

241
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,360
You can just set the pattern in which you want things to pop up.

242
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,790
So this is how you can just form it date and times according to your needs.

243
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,030
Now, whatever you have specified in these parameters, O'Haire, this person and this person, be this

244
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,830
person, Twi and all of these, these are basically known as the Formating Directorate's.

245
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,110
Now, these directives are a lot and these are all used using this function time.

246
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:13,140
S-T are FDM and some of these are one of them is the person and it is basically abbreviated for the

247
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,520
week they name.

248
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,640
And then we have got also our capital and that is going to print on the full weekday name.

249
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,160
Then we have got this B that is basically the abbreviated month name.

250
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,360
Then we have got A capital B that is also used to print the full month name.

251
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,890
The person B is going to generate the output, for example, for January.

252
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,600
It is going to generate only Jan.

253
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,120
But if you are using the capital B, then what it is going to do is that it is going to give you the

254
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,810
complete form.

255
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,690
The same goes for the small and capital is small is going to print.

256
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:55,200
For example, if you have small A and let's say you have sended today, then it is going to print on

257
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,570
only son for Sunday.

258
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,170
Then if you have capital then for Ascender it is going to print completely.

259
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:07,110
And that is what is the difference between capital and small capital B and small B, then you have one

260
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,440
more.

261
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
That is the person C.

262
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,400
And the person I see is basically the preffered local date and time representation, then you have the

263
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,750
person which you already have used that it used to show the day of the month.

264
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,370
Then you have this person, which you also have used, that is going to bring the order of the day.

265
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,520
Then you also have a person did sign with a capital and that is going to give you the order of the day,

266
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
but that is going to use the 12 hour clock.

267
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,640
As you can see that right over here where we are using this percentage Achuar here, you can see that

268
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,100
it is using the format of 24 hour clock.

269
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
That's why we have got this 23 over here, right here.

270
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,990
If you use a percentage, I and if you just replace this each with a capital, I just remove this from

271
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,430
here and now run this good.

272
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,650
You can see that now the format has been changed to the twelve o'clock and now the time is eleven point

273
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,220
twenty three.

274
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:10,000
It is going to be eleven but now it is going to be P.M. Then you have got a percentage sign with Jabe

275
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,480
that is like this and it is used to represent the day of the year.

276
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,850
Then we have got the person and which we already have used that is show that is used to show the month

277
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,330
of the year.

278
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,940
Then we have the percentage of capital M as well that is used to show the minute of the R, then we

279
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:34,910
have the percentage B that is used as the Meridien indicator that is known as the M r.p.m..

280
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,500
So when you are using percentage I, what you can do is that you can also use this Meridien thing over

281
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,760
here.

282
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,210
So right here you can just write in person B, just remove this from here.

283
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,290
Now run this code.

284
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,020
You can see that you also have got this yaml here.

285
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,200
So this is 11 18 B at this time.

286
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,130
Then you also have a percentage with a capital S., which you already have car that is used to show

287
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,070
the second of the minute, then you have got a percentage you that is used to show the weak number of

288
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:10,610
the current year, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of the first week, as you have already

289
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:16,370
noticed, that when we were just printing on the day before today did, then it was printing on zero

290
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:23,510
because it is Sunday today because sun starts with zero and then we have a percentage W that is used

291
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,970
to show the weak number of the current year, starting with the first Monday as the first day of the

292
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,720
first week.

293
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,060
Then we have a person with a small W that is used to show the day of the week, then we have a person

294
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,130
with a small X that is Reckford a representation for the date alone.

295
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,070
No time.

296
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,510
Then we have a percentage with a capital X that is the opposite of that.

297
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,350
That is used for the preferred representation of the time alone.

298
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,580
No date in that.

299
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,100
Then we have a percentage Y that is used to show you're without a century.

300
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,600
Then we have a percentage.

301
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,370
What a capital y which you already have that is used to show the year with a century.

302
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,160
Then we have got a percentage with a capital Z that is used to show that time zone name.

303
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,400
And then we have got the person person literally that is the literal percentage character.

304
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:23,680
So these were basically some of the directives that are basically known as the formating directives

305
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:31,840
for this SDR time function, which you can use to just print out the time in your own format, in whatever

306
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,510
format you want and whatever things you want to pop up.

307
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,920
You can just specify them as parameters to this SDR time function.

308
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,830
Then comes the last topic for this tutorial that is about the time arithmetics, you can perform simple

309
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,940
arithmetic with time and how that is going to be done.

310
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,650
Let's just remove this from hell and let's just do it with now.

311
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,570
And right here, what are going to do is that you can just fly in for its time on this and it is going

312
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,590
to bring down the time good enough.

313
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,330
Now, what you can do is that you can also know the past time.

314
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,320
You can also know the future time, and you can also calculate the difference between the future and

315
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,870
past time.

316
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,090
So to know the past and what you can do is that you can just have a variable past.

317
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,570
And what you can do is that you can just ride in time or you can just name it as the sea.

318
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,680
You double our current time so that it is much more accurate to what it is doing.

319
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,050
So we are going to ride in current time minus.

320
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:37,240
And let's say you just want to subtract 10 seconds, so that is going to generate the time that is at

321
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,340
10 seconds ago.

322
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,220
For example, if you just write in Hundert so that things are much more clear.

323
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:49,040
So 100 over here and then what you can do is that you can just write in votes or he'll run the score.

324
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,510
All right.

325
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,730
We have got some error with this.

326
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,890
That says undefined local variable or method time.

327
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,130
Yes, my bet you have changed it, though.

328
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,740
Well, we also have to change it over here now on this.

329
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,270
And you can see that the current time is twenty three.

330
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,500
Twenty one forty two.

331
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,690
But you can see that the past time that is before 100 seconds was 23, 20, 02.

332
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,030
So this means that hundert seconds were basically subtracted from the current time.

333
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,060
And this is the current time and this is the time.

334
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,750
That was 100 seconds ago.

335
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,860
Now you can also know what is the future time travel that you can just create a variable that is named

336
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,730
as future and you can just ride in the current time lapse.

337
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,970
And you can just add Hundert this time and you can just ride inputs.

338
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:46,330
Future around this, and you can see that you have got 20 for now, so this means that hundred seconds

339
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,690
have been added to this and this has been generated.

340
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:49,930
Right.

341
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,020
Now, you can also know the difference between these two.

342
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,550
That is the past and the future.

343
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:02,680
For that, you can just write in a variable that's a difference and that variable is going to equal

344
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,490
to future.

345
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,450
Minus past, so you can just ride in boats.

346
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:17,150
Difference run this code, and that is going to generate the difference that is 200 because the current

347
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:23,960
time was subtracted Hundert seconds before and then the current time was added that seconds also.

348
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,100
So that's why the difference was one hundred.

349
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,670
That makes it equal to two hundred seconds.

350
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,730
So whatever you are going to add, whatever you are going to subtract the answer and the things you

351
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,210
are going to specify right over here are basically going to be in seconds.

352
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,200
And this output has also been generated in seconds as well.

353
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:49,160
So that's how you can perform simple arithmetic with the time as well.

354
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,800
So thank you so much, gas, for watching.

355
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,260
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
