00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,380
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,830
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,550
So in this story, we are going to be covering the operators presidents in Ruby.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,780
So.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,330
Starting on with the first one, the very first president's.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,120
In any kind of operator, expression is given to bullion not.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,270
Bitwise complement and unary plus the second president's is for exponentiation, the next one is for

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,390
unary minus.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,920
The next is for the multiplication division and modulars.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,860
The next is for the simple addition and subtraction that is the arithmetic, addition and arithmetic,

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,670
subtraction.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:55,750
The next is for bitwise left shift and bitwise right shift, then comes the bitwise and and after that

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,800
we have the bitwise are all the bitwise czar.

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:05,590
Then we have the ordering that includes the greater than less than greater than equal to less than equal

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,160
cosigns.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,860
Then we have the equality, the federal matching and the comparisons operators.

17
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:21,310
Talking about some more, we have the bullion and then we have the bullion or then we have the range

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,710
creation and the bullion flipflops, then we have the conditional operator that includes that.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,250
If then else type of things, then we have the exception handling modifier, then we have the assignment

20
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,120
operator.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,280
Then we have the best variable definition and that includes the defined.

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,810
Then we have the bullion, not then we have bullion or and and finally we have the locks.

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,730
Now what do we mean by operators precedence over here, which means that if you have any kind of expression

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:58,240
in which you have multiple signs or you can say that you have multiple operators, then which operator

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
is going to be given the higher precedence and executed first?

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,150
That is basically the sequence which I have showed you.

27
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:14,010
So let me give you some examples for this, for that, I'll move on to my compiler at home and here

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,860
we are going to write in a simple expression that is boats.

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,210
And we are going to let's say dipen five plus six.

30
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:32,200
Minus, let's say nine, then divided by two, then add another nine in it, and then let's say multiply

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,750
it by two, then add.

32
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,610
A one in it and then finally subtract, let's say, 12 from it, so apparently if you calculate this

33
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,570
10 Cohill.

34
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,130
That is six plus five, equal to 11.

35
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,490
Let's just make it simple, so let's just make it three so that five, let's not treat it before.

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,410
So five plus four nine nine minus nine equal to zero, which is not good.

37
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,230
Let's just make it to something like 18.

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,320
So make it 14.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,800
So 14 plus four equal to 18, 18 minus nine equal to again nine nine.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,730
Divided by 19, divided by nine, divided by two is going to be equal to four because that part is going

41
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,030
to be the decimal board and then you add a nine in it.

42
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:27,800
So that will make it equal to 13 13 multiplied by two to 26, then minus one from a 25 and then sorry,

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,150
add one in to that.

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,180
It is going to go to 27 and I guess 15 is going to be the answer if you talk about the apparent and

45
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,650
the sequence twice calculation.

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,510
But if you press all plus are, the answer is going to be twenty one.

47
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,610
Now that is because it has followed some operator precedents.

48
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:53,210
Some operations are performed at the start, some operations are performed after that, and the very

49
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,470
same operator precedents have been followed, which I just showed you on the slides.

50
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,350
So that's why 15 was not generated.

51
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,060
And you have this 21 hour hail.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,260
Now, I leave it up to you to calculate why it has generated 21 by following the operator precedents

53
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,840
I just showed you, so that is basically how operator precedence is going to follow.

54
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,920
And in the future, tutorial is going to be covering more topics that will include the conditionals.

55
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,400
We will be.

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,380
Talking about more operators and many of the steps that, let's say, include the Boolean and ignore

57
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:35,250
this orange and assignment operator, the conditional, the flipflops, then you will also come to know

58
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,650
that how these follow a certain sequence.

59
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,920
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,920
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

61
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,380
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
