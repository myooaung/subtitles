00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.350
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.950
This was a marathon, and I welcome you to another detour on this course on Aruba and in this adorable

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.340
we are going to be talking about the M I l that is the Nhill object.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.090
And I told you before that if you have knowledge about other programming language, then in most of

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
the other programming languages we used and you in place of Naiad.

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.520
But in Ruby we have the Nile, which is a kind of a special thing.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.650
So Aneel is a special ruby object that is used to represent an empty or default value.

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.580
It also represent a falsey value, meaning that it behaves like false when used in a conditional statement,

9
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.250
which you are going to see in the future tutorial.

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.580
But for now, let me just show you that.

11
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.780
What this.

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.600
I is going to print out when you use the word sprint and be with it.

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.550
So let's just move on to admiral here and here, we are going to start on with, let's say, ports and

14
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.360
we are going to run ports and I'll just press outlets are and as you can see, that line space has been

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.170
added over here.

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.450
Let me just show it to you again.

17
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.520
If I just press all this here, you can see that it is a single line over here.

18
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.150
But if I just press.

19
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.230
What am I out?

20
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.810
Are you can see that Atlantis has been added because what ports do is that at alliance space, but Naomi's

21
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.460
got nothing.

22
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.680
So let's talk about the second one that is print and I press R plus R, and as you can see, nothing

23
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.690
happened.

24
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.480
No line space, nothing O'Haire.

25
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.960
Then be with NASA Press Cortazar and you can see that it printed an ad on the screen because as I told

26
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.840
you before that what you do is that we basically print whatever string is printed along with the quotation

27
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.140
marks.

28
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.820
So here it was printing something old with quotation marks on it from nothing it printed out and I add

29
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.020
in place of that.

30
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.930
So that is the difference for how thoughts and print works on with an object.

31
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.180
You are going to see a lot of this nial object in the future editorial as well when we will be using

32
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.520
conditional statements and when writing extensive kind of codes in Ruby.

33
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.710
So that's why I did this and I'll object introduction tutorial and the basic part.

34
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.470
So I hope you have understood this.

35
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.660
So I guess that's it for this tutorial as well.

36
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.260
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

37
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.420
And I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
