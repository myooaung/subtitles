00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,440
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,970
This is American, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby and in this story,

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,970
and we are going to see how to open and close and existing files in the previous tutorial.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,900
We already have created two files.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,610
The husband was violent and the second one was files.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,670
So in this story, we are going to see how we are going to open and then how we are going to close those

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,010
files, which we have already created.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,500
So if you talk about the syntax of how to open a file that is right here, you have to write and file

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,550
equal to file dot open and you have to write in the name of the file you want to open.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,810
And then comes how to close a file that is as simple as file dot closed and the file is going to get

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,150
closed.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,240
So let me just show you how to implement both this practically.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,960
So we will want to add them.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,010
And you can see that we have already created these two files.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,110
So here we are going to do is that we are going to create a variable, let's say we are, and that is

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,210
what is going to contain the file.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,970
So we are going to write and file.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,010
Door open and here we are going to specify the name of the file.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,930
So let's say we want to open this first file.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,390
We are going to write in file dot the 60.

21
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:26,740
We will run the school and the school has run successfully, which means now this file is open in the

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,420
background.

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,410
So you must be thinking that the file has not popped up because this is what is not going to happen.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:41,440
What is going on that the file is now open in background and in the NextRadio will when we will be seeing

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,230
how to read and write to a file, you can see that how we can just open a file and it will be open in

26
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,860
the background.

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,330
We will just added that file.

28
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:56,170
And when I just go into the documents folder and open that file, you will see that whatever text we

29
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,450
have written are written over here is going to be shown on the file of what they are.

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,840
So the file is not going to pop up.

31
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,930
It is going to just open in the background.

32
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,440
So now when this command gets executed, your file has been opened.

33
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,380
Now what you can do is using this variable.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,150
You can just close the file as well.

35
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,920
So you can just write in variable dot, close around this code.

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,760
And now the file has been closed successfully.

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,930
So whenever you have to perform the reading and writing operation, you have to do it right over here.

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,120
If you want to perform the reading, you have to do it over here.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,400
And if you want to perform the writing, you have to do it right over here.

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,530
This has to be hash tags for comments.

41
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,830
So this is a part of I guess the next tutorials will be the next tutorial, we are going to see how

42
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,880
to read and write a file.

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,520
And if you don't open a file and try to perform the reading or writing operation, it is going to generate

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,240
an error and tell you that you have tried to read or write to a file which is not opened.

45
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,280
And then why is this O'Haire important?

46
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,210
Why is it so important to close a file?

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,850
Because the file is going to be opened in the background.

48
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:16,040
It is going to for sure occupy some space or to free up that space and to allow that space to be used

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,920
by some other useful operations.

50
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,950
You have to close the file so that the space becomes free.

51
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,010
So that's like closing a file is very important after you have opened it, because apparently it doesn't

52
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,650
show up, because apparently the things that are showing up, you can just simply go on to the right

53
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,980
bar and you can just click this gross error and you can just close this.

54
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,170
But if you don't have something that is showing up and is running in the background and occupying some

55
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,220
space, then it is a must thing that whenever you have open this, you have to close this as well.

56
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,570
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

57
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,590
In the next iteration, we are going to see how to read and write to a file.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,740
So stay tuned for that.

59
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,620
Thank you so much for now and I'll see you guys in the next rhetorical.
