Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.200
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.450
And in this tutorial, we are going to be covering some convergence and we are going to see two kind

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.520
of convergence in this tutorial.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.080
The first one is going to be from number to string in which we will see how to convert a number to a

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.650
string and then we will see the price for us all that which will be converting a string to number.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.940
Now, Ruby provides that to underscore I and the two underscore F methods to convert a string to numbers.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.950
Now to underscore aykan words and string to an integer and the two underscore efkan words a string to

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.490
offload.

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.220
No, whereas if you talk about the others, that is string to numbers or the number of the strings.

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.660
Then the ruby provides the two underscore s method to convert the number into a string.

12
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.620
So how that is going to be practically done.

13
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.750
Let's just cover some examples so I will move on to the atom.

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.460
Now, here we are.

15
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.540
Now, the first thing we are going to be covering is how to convert a string to a number now to convert

16
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.490
a string to a number.

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.830
I told you that we used that to underscore Ayanda, to underscore aph methods.

18
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.060
So, for example, we have, let's say, a string.

19
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.930
That is, let's say, five, and we want to convert it into an integer, so we are going to try to do

20
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.280
that to underscore and that is what is going to convert this number to an integer.

21
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.730
So, for example, just.

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.270
Right in a variable exhale.

23
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.210
Make it equal to five and then what I do is that I write an X dot, do I and I will write in here.

24
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.040
Boats.

25
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.960
Dot class.

26
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.530
And.

27
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.410
Down here, I would just again ride in boats x dot glass, so here I would dive in boats.

28
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.330
Class of X is.

29
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.010
And here I will again type in a glass of X.

30
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.940
After.

31
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.120
Convergence is and I will just encourage these.

32
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.030
I haven't caught these as well.

33
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.250
A call and then what I will do also is that I will in court this double quotation marks so that X equals

34
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.540
to five and five is basically a string.

35
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:03.270
And I guess one thing I need to do more here is that I have to, I guess, just remove this from here.

36
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.840
And I have to use that to underscore my method and class.

37
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.750
Right to help.

38
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.230
And I will tell you the reason after I run this code.

39
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.470
So I run the score and you can see that it's this class of X is string before that and after the conversion,

40
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.180
the class of X after this to underscore is applied on this X..

41
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.630
We have this integer will help.

42
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.290
Now why did I use it all here?

43
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.600
And not that that was because X is an integer that contains a value.

44
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.220
Converting that number into a class is basically going to convert that, but only for that single line.

45
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.570
Nordoff did that, for example, if I just press control that multiple times.

46
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.310
I have converted to I I run this code and as you can see that it is the class of X after conversion

47
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.640
is still string because it is considering this X equal to five, because it will not convert it like

48
00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.940
that.

49
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.020
If you want to convert it, you have to use it in the same line as I did.

50
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.120
That was to underscore I last remove it from here, run this code and for that very line where you have

51
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.240
converted it, when you use person that it is going to tell you that the class of X after the conversion

52
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.000
is basically an integer.

53
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.670
So that's why you can not use it at the top.

54
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.820
You have to use it right here in this line.

55
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.780
Now, if you want to convert this X to offload, no, you have to just write an F around this code.

56
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
And as you can see, that it's discloser effects after conversion is flawed.

57
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.050
Now, if you want to convert a number into a string, then what do you have to do is that you have to

58
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.330
just remove these from here.

59
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.120
And you have to use that to underscore s dot gloss over here, run the score and it says the class of

60
00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.660
X is first integer and after the conversion, the glass is basically string.

61
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.260
And that's how basically you can just convert a string to a no and a no to a string.

62
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.970
So I guess that's it.

63
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.950
What this tutorial.

64
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.720
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

65
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.640
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
