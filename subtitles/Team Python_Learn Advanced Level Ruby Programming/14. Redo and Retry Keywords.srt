00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,610
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,240
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby and in this story,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,180
and we are going to be, again, covering Dougie was the first one is going to be the real key word.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,420
And then we are going to go on with the really tricky work now, starting on with the first one in Ruby,

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:24,320
the redo statement is used to repeat the current iteration of the loop redo always is used inside the

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,540
loop and the redo statement basically restarts the loop without evaluating the condition again.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,730
So, for example, if you just look on with some example of that, for example, we have a follow in

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,850
which we have a variable eye and we want to have a loop from zero to nine.

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,770
So what we are going to do is that if, let's say some certain variable color, for example, we say

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,910
that if I is equal, equal to, let's say five, then we what we want is that we want to redo things.

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,220
And what do we have to do else is that we have to just.

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,090
And this.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,860
And this for lap as well, and we also have to just print out numbers over here, so we are going to

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,710
let's just have both.

15
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,950
And we are going to write in the numbers, so we're going to write in the hashtag nine.

16
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,490
We are going to just copy this from Hill Bastida Hill, and we're also going to add a statement, boats.

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,780
Reto statement.

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,650
I do.

19
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,870
Yes, we have missed the last sign of war here, my bad.

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,380
We have to get this like that.

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,880
Just do it like that.

22
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,670
Run this code.

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,950
And as you can see that you have got zero.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,030
One, two, three, four.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,790
Then you have to I is five.

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,900
After that, the flag was set to true.

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,400
So that's why I you and came back with the value of this conditional hail was true.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,110
But since the flag is now Drewes so that this condition over here is going to be false, it is going

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,170
to just come out, it is going to end, it is going to put the value.

30
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,530
It is going to go back now because since it has not encountered the value of Preto because the flag

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:16,920
was fall.

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,210
So that's why it is going to incremented the gun now and that GUNDRY is now going to equal to six.

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,410
But as it can do for the first condition when the flag was false, it has.

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,820
Encounter the value of equal to five, and it has the right to implement it on that.

35
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,430
So that's what I equal to five and equal to five are printed twice hill.

36
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:45,470
So that is what is basically the purpose of real and if you just reuse a redo without using a flag,

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,230
then it is also going to create a never ending loop.

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,590
So you always have to use a flag when you're using the redo statement.

39
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,050
Then comes the second key word we have to use in this tutorial.

40
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,080
That is the retries statement and two that is used basically to repeat the whole loop I had written

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,100
from the start.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,540
We have to use the retries statement and read statement again is always used inside the loop.

43
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,750
So to implement that, just remove this from here.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,870
And what you have to do is let's use the do I look this time and you've already come on with come up

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,230
with the syntax of the times and you know how this works.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,730
What do is that?

47
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,560
It executes something again and again.

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,860
So 10 times what do we have to do is that you have to do a variable that is, let's say I and we are

49
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:46,880
going to just begin that and begin basically what to do is that it starts a blog of good.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,270
And then what we are going to write and we are going to write in votes.

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,580
And we are going to just see the cycle numbers.

52
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,730
We're going to write in Psycho.

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,400
No, I.

54
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,890
And after that, what we were going to do is that we are going to use race if.

55
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:12,340
I is greater than I do, and what Raise is going to do is that it is going to basically raise a kind

56
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,620
of exception, nobody's exception, that is going to be a part of the future tutorials into that.

57
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,260
But for now, you need to know that whenever this phrase is used and a certain condition, as it is

58
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,440
implied with that, then for whatever condition this raises use, it is going to raise some kind of

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,870
message that is going to tell us that basically this condition, which you have specified with this

60
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,670
rescue work, has been met.

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,080
So what we are going to do is that we are going to.

62
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,390
We already have used this, we are going to just move out of this, we are going to ride in rescue and

63
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,490
rescue is basically going to deal with whatever has been raised over here.

64
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,790
So we are going to write an.

65
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,360
Retrial here.

66
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,290
And what retrial is going to do is that if I just run the score, you're going to understand yourself,

67
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,490
as you can see, if I just.

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:18,870
Move up the top here, you can see that you you have starting on from Secretary Secretary Hagel through

69
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,470
secretary, you have got a whole lot of secretary, which is basically going to be an endless loop and

70
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,980
it is going to just keep running and running and running.

71
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:37,020
So what's basically going on out here is that it started on with this big key word since this I at the

72
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,240
first instance was going to equal to zero.

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,340
So that's why I cycle number zero is going to be printed, which is going to be at the very top.

74
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,110
But since this is going on, I guess I could not show you.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, it just scroll down back again.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,620
But if you just stop this and just go on to the top, you're going to see cycle number zero.

77
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,450
Then you're going to see cycle number one.

78
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,250
Then you're going to see cycle number two after that, when this condition is met, which means that

79
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,110
it is greater than two for the value of AI, which is going to equal to three, then what it is going

80
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,130
to do is that it is going to continue on with this retreat and cycle.

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
Number three is going to.

82
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,880
Get branded.

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,070
Infinitely.

84
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,530
But if you specify a condition with it or just use flags again or whatever, it is going to actually

85
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:20,930
stop.

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,360
So that is what is basically the purpose of the redo and the retry.

87
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
Key words in Ruby.

88
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,200
And again, you are going to be seeing a lot of these in the future stories as well.

89
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,200
So I guess you have understood them now.

90
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,810
So that's it with this tutorial.

91
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Thank you so much for watching.

92
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,490
I'll see you guys in the next redrill.
