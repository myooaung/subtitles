Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.570
This is American, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby and I have come back

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.810
with the advanced version of this calculator, but that is not that advanced, but a bit advanced.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.900
And which instead of writing those two numbers in the brackets, what we have done here is that we have

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.330
taken those number as an input from the user.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
So what you can do is that you can just write in votes and topos number and you can write an X equal

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.140
to gets.

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.570
So which mean that it is going to ask you for the value of X. Then you can write inputs into a second

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.390
number, then you can write in Y equal to get.

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.590
So it is also going to ask you for the value of Y, then you can write in position of two numbers.

11
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.630
And that is going to remain the very same.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.190
The difference here is going to be that the value of X and Y are going to be stored whatever value you

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.500
are going to enter on your input.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.160
So that are going to be passed in as an argument to the above function x, y, x, y, y.

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.000
Those are going to be read in O'Haire.

16
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.880
The sum subtraction, multiplication and division answers are going to be written over here, which

17
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.820
are going to be outputted on your screen and to run the score.

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.620
Do you know that you can just go on or Hill?

19
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.430
Your program is automatically going to load and you are going to just write in Ruby.

20
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.550
First file.

21
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.480
Not RB, you can just run the score and as you can see that it is asking for you for the first number,

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.450
you can just specify the second number, you can specify the second number.

23
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.890
You can run the Goda and it is going to give you the answers.

24
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.450
So this Dorian was only for those who might have encountered any kind of errors.

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.940
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

26
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.330
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.130
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
