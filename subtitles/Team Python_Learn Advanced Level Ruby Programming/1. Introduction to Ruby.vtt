00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.350
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.180
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another story on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.840
And in this drill, we are going to be covering that introduction to Ruby.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.290
So Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object oriented general-purpose programming language.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.160
Ruby is a pure, object oriented language, which means that everything in Ruby is an object except

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.820
the blocks.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.250
But there are replacements for it, too, which includes the Bronx and lambdas which will be covering

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.420
in the future tutorials.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.190
The objective of Ruby's development was to make it as a sensible buffer between human programmers and

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.750
the underlying computing machinery.

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.460
Ruby has similar syntax to that of many programming languages like C, C++ and Java.

12
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.430
So it is easy for the Java and C programmers to learn Ruby.

13
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.940
It supports mostly all the platforms like the Windows, the Mac and the Linux based systems.

14
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.130
So Ruby is based on many other programming languages like Berl, less small dog Eifel and ETA.

15
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.870
It is an integrated scripting language, which means most of its implementations execute instructions

16
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.800
directly and freely without previously compiling a program into machine language instructions.

17
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.980
Ruby programers also have access to the powerful Ruby Gems, which basically provides a standard format

18
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.580
for a ruby.

19
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.480
Programs and libraries now coming to the advantages of the Ruby programming languages.

20
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100
Ruby has a lot of advantages.

21
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.590
The first one is that the code written in the Ruby programming language is very small, it is elegant

22
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.330
and it is powerful as it has very fewer a number of lines of code.

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.440
The second advantage is that Ruby allows simple and fast creation of Web applications, which result

24
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.120
in less hard work.

25
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.200
And there is an extension to Ruby that is called as Ruby on Rails.

26
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.110
And that is basically what is used for Web development in Ruby.

27
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.440
The third advantage of Ruby is that Ruby is free of charge.

28
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.380
That is, Ruby is free to copy, use, modify.

29
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.830
It allows the programmers to make necessary changes as and when required.

30
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.040
One more advantage is that Ruby is a dynamic programming language due to which there is no tougher rules

31
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.990
on how to build in features.

32
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.890
And it is very close to the spoken languages.

33
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.060
So coming towards the applications you have in Ruby, Ruby is used to create Web application of different

34
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.750
sorts.

35
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.970
It is one of the hot technology at present to create a Web application.

36
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.820
And as I told you, that Ruby offers a great feature that is called Ruby on Rails.

37
00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:00.730
It is a framework that is used by programmers to speed up the development process and save that time.

38
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.660
So Ruby overall is an excellent language to use.

39
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.180
And if you want to become a pro coder or a pro programmer, then you should have a list of languages

40
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.980
you must have learned and Ruby should be one of them.

41
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.230
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

42
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.920
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

43
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.650
And I will see you guys in the next tutorial.
