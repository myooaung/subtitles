Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.030
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another Dorelle on this course, on Ruby and in this story

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.150
we are going to cover the Philmont.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.820
So whatever is going to be a part of the next story on from this tutorial is going to be basically have

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.380
this file more so before going on with how to create a new file, how to read or write to a file.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.620
This story is very important because you need to know the modes in which you can basically create a

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.520
file or you can just open a file.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
So to talk about these, I created a table for that.

9
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.850
So these are some of the Morts and their operations are written right in front of them.

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
The first mode is the AH mode in which you can open a file or you can create a file, and that is known

11
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.760
as the read on the access file.

12
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.750
So if you want to open a file and you want to only give the access of Read-Only, then you can use this

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.250
Modarres to give the user only the read-only permissions.

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.360
Then you have the R plus that basically gives the permission of read as well as rights to read and write.

15
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.880
Access are given through the hour plus then you have W that gives only the right only access.

16
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.900
So basically the R and the W, if you just combine them then that is known as R plus, which is about

17
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.480
where you get the permissions of both read and write, then you have got a plus as well that also give

18
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.390
the reader and right access the very same as R plus.

19
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.600
Then you have got this egg that gives the right on the access which is very similar to W and then you

20
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
have the ableist that gives the read and write access similar to the plus an hour plus.

21
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.640
But there is, there are situations where I have to, you have to use this Arblaster where you have

22
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.970
to use plus and where you have to use airplanes because it would be totally unnecessary to create three

23
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.150
types of more with the same operations.

24
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.620
They are a bit different from each other in some prospectives.

25
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.710
So unmoored from the next tutorial, maybe you will be using some or maybe you will be using all of

26
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.710
these modes in the future examples.

27
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.510
So in that then you will see the examples of that.

28
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.730
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

29
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.290
Thank you so much for watching.

30
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.000
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial where we are creating our first file.

31
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.040
So my till then.
