00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,480
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,020
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Dubea.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,510
And in this tutorial we are going to see how to read and write to a file.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,250
Now, in the previous tutorial, you have covered how to open a file and how to create a new one.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:22,390
So in this story, what we are going to do is that we are either going to open the existing file or

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:29,790
we are going to create a new file and then we are going to perform these two operations on those files.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,270
So let's get to it.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,630
So if you talk about the syntax of these, so talking about reading it is something like file equal

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,760
to file dot new, which means that in this case, a new file is being opened.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,390
You can simply write and follow up and write the name of the file as well.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,670
But you can do this job over here as well.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,890
Now to create a new file.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,130
Why?

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:57,580
It is important because if you want to read a file, then you have to write in this are over here.

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,510
If you don't if you want to open a file and you have created that file before and you have created that

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:10,900
file with W Mutawakkil here instead of this Arawa over here, then you will not be able to perform the

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,070
reading operation over here, because in order to perform the reading operation, this are over here

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,480
is very much so.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,660
It is a better approach to either create a new file.

20
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:27,760
If you want to read that, if you want to just open that file, then you must ensure that the file that

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,360
has been created before has been created using this hour more.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,540
If you want to perform the reading, if you want to perform the writing, then this has to, which I

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
will cover in the next slide.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,410
Then what are you going to do is that you are going to create one more variable content.

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,790
You can just write in any name over here and then you are going to write in this name over file dot

26
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,120
reading.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:53,770
Now, this is not the part of the syntax over here since a file can be read using many, many functions.

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,310
So you will write the name of the function right over here.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,110
So that's why I've written reading over here.

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,040
Reading is not a function at all.

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,540
There is a function known as RE.

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,000
There is a function on a system read analogue which will we will be covering, then we will get to the

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,780
examples part.

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,950
So that's why I've read and read reading over here and then you got to write in the number of characters

35
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,820
you want to read in.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,950
Next come how to perform the writing operation, and it is like finally going to find that new file

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,230
name our place and the same logic.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,060
That if you want to open a file, then you must ensure that the file has been created before with this

39
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,310
hour plus more, or you can just write in as well, because, you know, the hour plus is basically

40
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,870
a combination of reading and writing.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,050
So if you have created a file before in the hour plus mode, then you can perform the reading as well

42
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,210
as writing on that five.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,980
So you want to create a new file, just write an hour plus.

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,710
Or if you want to only perform the right thing, you can just write in him.

45
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,960
And then again, writing is not a function.

46
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,820
There are a lot of function through which you can perform the writing.

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,750
So that's why I've written writing O'Hara and and how you are going to write in the next you want to

48
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,480
print or you want to insert or you want to write on to the file you have created.

49
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,720
Right.

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,120
Or help.

51
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,390
So let's move on to the example spot.

52
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:14,540
And first, what we will do is that we will perform the writing operation and after that we will move

53
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,420
on to the reading part, because whatever we will have written, we are going to then read that in the

54
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,130
second part of this tutorial.

55
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,340
So we already have got these two fires of hell.

56
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,750
We have got files and files, but both have been created in the W mode.

57
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:39,110
So what we are going to do is that we are going to just change the name of the files so that we have

58
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,480
the files which we want to create in our mode.

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,120
So we will use the plus mode, which stands for reading plus writing, and we will change the name of

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,950
the file here to file.

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,240
Just riding.

62
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,110
Riding a wave while riding.

63
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,670
Dati is going to be the file will just remove this file from here, we will create this to be filed,

64
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,250
then we will have a variable through which we will open this file to writing.

65
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,480
Writing or he'll just remove this for now, we will just run the score and we will ensure that the file

66
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,490
has been created.

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,940
So if you just go home, all right.

68
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,130
So we have got some errors.

69
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,550
That's why the file was not creating.

70
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,280
It says file writing is some kind of error, OK?

71
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,220
It is.

72
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,660
Let's change the mode and then try and let's try it and just run this now and not run perfectly, let's

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,050
just see the file has been created.

74
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,930
Yes, it has.

75
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,240
It was not supposed to create an error with the R plus mode.

76
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,080
I guess there is some problem with the editor, maybe.

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,890
So you can just try it on your editor.

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,000
If it works then it is pretty cool if it doesn't just change the motor and then it is going to work

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,690
as you have seen.

80
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,230
So if you want to write to a file and you are creating a new file, then after creating the new file,

81
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,140
you also have to open that file as well.

82
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,570
So we have just written a variable.

83
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,160
We are equal to file dot open and now the file has been opened.

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,010
Now we can just perform the reading or writing operation, but first we will perform the writing operation.

85
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,790
So you just remove this from here.

86
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,940
And right after this, we are going to profounder reading, sorry, writing by.

87
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,460
All right, so if you just write and file dot, right?

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,810
Then you have to write in the name of the file, so you're going to write and fire DOT writing, which

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,860
is the name of the file.

90
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,960
And then the second barometer is going to be the data you want to store in that file.

91
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,300
So we are going to, let's say, just right and Dada's Dawid.

92
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,030
In the file.

93
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,870
So that's good and others just move it a bit ahead around this code and it has run perfectly.

94
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,990
So now what you need to do is that you need to go on to the documents and you can see that you have

95
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,600
got this file writing O'Haire created.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Just open it and it is going to ask you that in what you want to open.

97
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,950
It is just open it in notepad and you can see that you have got this that are stored in the file and

98
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,160
it has been printed right over here, as you can see.

99
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,780
And we have written it right from here.

100
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,570
Now in place of writing the name of the file over here, which is basically opening the file.

101
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,880
You can just use this over here, because we have also written this line of work here so you can just

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,450
write in via our in place of this and to ensure that this has all just change this line and right in

103
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,730
second that are stored in the file or on this code.

104
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,240
Go ahead, open the file.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,130
Open this and you can see that now it's a second that are stored in the file, so you can also use this

106
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,620
variable right over here to basically write data to a file because it has this line file open.

107
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,450
And if you just write in the name of the file, then basically you are writing this line right over

108
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,800
here.

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,390
So you can for a simple purpose, you can just use the.

110
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,780
Variable in which you have stored this stuff over here, the next thing is if you want to write an error

111
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,980
to a file, you will have to convert it into a string first.

112
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,370
So if you have this right over here, you can just write in the name of the file, which means opening

113
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:26,710
a file.

114
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,910
So we use the very same variable over here.

115
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,230
Just remove this from here.

116
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,870
And what we are going to do is that we are going to specify an error.

117
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,710
So an error looks something like this.

118
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,060
Let's say it has three elements one, two, three.

119
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,500
So we are going to use the design method with this and we are going to join them with a separator.

120
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,440
So that separator is going to be a new line space.

121
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,910
And after that, we are going to do is that we are going to specify mode as well ahead.

122
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,020
And the mode is going to be.

123
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,370
Now, what does this mean?

124
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,740
What here is that we want whatever data is to be read anywhere.

125
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,980
We want that to be appended.

126
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,990
So we just run this code and it has run successfully.

127
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,290
Now, all you need to do is that go on to your documents folder, open this file right in and you can

128
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,050
see that you have got this one, two and three right over here.

129
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,870
So just delete this file because this is not what is required every time you run this code, if you

130
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,710
now just rerun this code.

131
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,640
Go on back and you can see that you have got this file.

132
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,120
Hey, I just see that.

133
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,390
But that is one, two, three.

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,810
You have got that output.

135
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,390
Now, if you want to append something more to this file, because in a previous case, you might have

136
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,360
noticed that whatever line we print, that was actually overridden.

137
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,330
So now if you just write in file dot.

138
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,440
Right.

139
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,230
We are let's say you just ride in.

140
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,590
Now above.

141
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,450
Lines are part.

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,760
Of an area.

143
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,770
And we are going to specify the third argument as mode and we are going to specify the mode as a round,

144
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:19,420
this could go back, open this file and you can see that you have got this, that the above lines are

145
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,010
part of an area.

146
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,520
So now the data has not been actually overwritten.

147
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:31,600
Rather, it has just been appended to whatever code we already have in the file.

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,710
So that's how basically you can just use the mode of operation of a here to append data to a file.

149
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,130
Now there is one more way in which you can also write to a file, and that is known as the system.

150
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,610
Right.

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:54,310
So if you just remove this line from here for now, so what you're going to do is that you are going

152
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,870
to.

153
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,250
Right.

154
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,050
And that's why I asked why this system.

155
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,460
Right.

156
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:06,010
And after that, what are you going to do is that you are going to simply write in the data here so

157
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,870
that say, how old is the data?

158
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,750
And right over here, you don't have to use this file.

159
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,110
Well, here we are going to use the variable in which you have opened this file.

160
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,890
So we are going to write in via our DOT system or.

161
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,340
Right.

162
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,560
Or if you don't want this as well, you can just use this file variable over here as well.

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,360
So you can just write and filed our system.

164
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,750
Right.

165
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,340
Or underscore it.

166
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,370
And it has run perfectly.

167
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,810
Just go open this file and you can see that you have got this HelloWallet over here since we did not

168
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,450
use the append over here.

169
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,560
So that's why the previous data was overwritten.

170
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,050
And you have got this.

171
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,460
Hello, would or help.

172
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,900
So after doing all the stuff related to writing, you can just simply write in variable dot clause here

173
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,460
on this.

174
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,700
And this will basically close your file.

175
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,960
And closing a file actually means just freeing up the space, which can then be used for other useful

176
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,990
purposes as well.

177
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,500
So I guess that's it for writing.

178
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:11,870
Now, let's move on to the second part of the JUREL that deals with how to read files in Ruby.

179
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,900
Now, there are multiple ways of how you can just read files in Ruby.

180
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,130
The simplest of all is you can just write and file trade.

181
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,220
So we already have a file names while writing, so we will just remove this from here.

182
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,910
So what we will do is that we will simply open this file that is variable equal to file dot open and

183
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,910
we will open the file file writing, not the XDA.

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,760
And now we are going to perform the reading operation on this.

185
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,270
So what we are going to do is that we are going to use this variable.

186
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,780
We are and we are going to store it in the reading variable.

187
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:58,360
So we are going to write in reading equal to variable rate and in the variable rate, we are going to

188
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,070
write in the name of the file.

189
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,380
So we are going to write and file file writing the X, D and downhill.

190
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,470
What we are going to do is we are going to just write in votes.

191
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Reading and Octodad, the file is going to be closed as well.

192
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,650
Now what's reading is going to do is that it is going to just print out any data that is stored in the

193
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,030
files.

194
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,990
So why it is going to print out?

195
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,860
Because this reading variable contains variable Dautry and it contains all the data that is written

196
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,340
in this file.

197
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,440
Now you must be thinking that this file was created in the W mode.

198
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,080
Now W would also allow you to just read the files as well.

199
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:47,540
So if our place is not working in your editor, then W is going to have the privileges of the reading

200
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,510
and writing as well.

201
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,100
So if you just run this code.

202
00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:00,960
All right, so it says it has got some kind of error and no implicit conversion of string into dijo.

203
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,030
All right, my bad.

204
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,970
This should not be a part hair, because since we have written, we are so it knows that it has to open

205
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,350
this file.

206
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,110
You don't have to specify this as a parameter with the read function as well.

207
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,020
So now just run the score and you can see that you have got the hello message, which you have written

208
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,410
on to this file file writing in the previous example.

209
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,570
If you just open this file over here, you can see that you have got only this text over here which

210
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,400
has been read successfully using the read function.

211
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,490
Now, there is another way of reading that as well.

212
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,750
If you are working with a file that has multiple lines, you can either split the file that are used,

213
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,060
that read lines method.

214
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,830
Does the job method remove the new line characters as well?

215
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,140
But in a sense, in this case we have got only one line of data, so we cannot implement that either.

216
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,030
Just write in the syntax for that.

217
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,740
So if you want to try that as well, you can just try it as well.

218
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,760
But that what you have to do is that you have to right and this in place of this what you are going

219
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,240
to right.

220
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,400
And you are going to write in the name of the variable, that is are you going to.

221
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,610
Right.

222
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,970
And we are red realigns.

223
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,450
Map malfunction, which you already have created, have covered in the previous story as well, and

224
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,710
you are going to use the material here and what you know, what is the purpose of Trump over here?

225
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,750
Trump is going to remove any kind of line spaces that are going to get created in this file, whatever

226
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,340
you are going to try to print.

227
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:46,200
So if you don't just run this code and it says undefined variable or a local method, TRUMP All right.

228
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,430
It has to be dot.

229
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,420
And then it has to be Chope.

230
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,990
And according to here as well.

231
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,230
Now run this code and it is going to bring down HelloWallet.

232
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:06,310
So in this case, if you would have multiple lines, then those multiple lines also would have got printed

233
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,990
right over here.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,280
And after that, you can just write a post rating and you also have to close the file as well.

235
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,850
Now, if you want to process a file, a one letter at a time, you can also use the for each method

236
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,560
for that.

237
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,270
But since in this case, we also have only one line.

238
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,500
So that's why we can use it.

239
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,230
And you already have used the average method so you can just try it with this function as well.

240
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,600
So what you can do is that you can just write in something like.

241
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,310
File dot for each.

242
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,160
And in the Parameterize, you are going to write in the name of the files, we are going to write and

243
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,480
file writing and then what are you going to do outside of here is that you are going to create a blog

244
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,670
and in the blog you are going to have these bars in which you are going to specify the variable in which

245
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,040
you want to store one line at a time.

246
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,590
And after that, you wanted to print this line as well.

247
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,930
So it is going to store one line, print it out, store the second line, print it out and so on.

248
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,490
It is going to keep doing this Tingo here as well.

249
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:17,130
So if for that purpose, what do you have to do is that you don't need any of these as well, just run

250
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,750
this code and it says no such file or directory.

251
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,070
All right, you have to ride in the exterior here.

252
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,390
Now, run this and you can see that it has printed how the world has seen the very similar, if you

253
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,170
would have multiple lines of warhead and those multiple lines would get printed over here as well.

254
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,050
One last method you need to understand of how to read the file is the SLA is good.

255
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,680
It is very similar to the NSW Right, which you have covered in the writing part.

256
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,370
And what you have to do over here is that you have to use the previous index.

257
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,140
So we will adjust price controls at multiple times.

258
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,430
We will just remove this from here.

259
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:07,800
And in here, we are going to just write and content equal to our dot.

260
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:15,800
System, right, and up to that, we are going to ride in the characters you want to point out.

261
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,000
So that's the biggest ride in five of us here on this score.

262
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:27,810
And it is going to only bring the first five characters of our file, which we have here, that is filed

263
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,650
right across the street.

264
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,750
So this is how you can also just read a file in Ruby.

265
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,540
So these two are, I guess, four to five ways in which you have understood how to read a file and you

266
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,110
have understood also to the two to three days of how to write to a file as well.

267
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,950
So I guess that's enough with this.

268
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,460
So I guess that's it with this tutorial as well.

269
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,160
That was an extensive tutorial.

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,400
But in this, you have understood all the ways in which you can read or write to apply.

271
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,520
So I guess that's it.

272
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,900
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

273
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,510
And I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
