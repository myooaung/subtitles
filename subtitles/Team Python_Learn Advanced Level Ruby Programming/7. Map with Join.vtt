00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.510
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.140
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another Dooralong on this course, on Ruby and in this story

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.590
that we are going to see how to convert an area to a strengthening.

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.530
The previous minister, Doria, you have seen how to use the map function.

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.090
So in this, literally, we are going to see how to convert an area to a strength and then we are going

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.430
to use the China method and talk some.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.070
Stuff about that gyne method.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.140
And finally, we are going to see how are you going to use the map function over here as well.

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.510
So starting on how to convert an array to a string, so all object in Ruby have basically to underscore

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380
this method, which converts the object to a string.

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.840
And this is what the print statement uses.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.870
Given any kind of area you have O'Haire, it is going to convert that error into a string and you have

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.030
already covered that in the previous tutorial as well.

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.030
So I don't think I need to get into example of that.

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.350
So.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.250
Then comes the giant method, not the giant method, going towards an area to a string, but it gives

17
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.700
you much more control of how you want the elements combined.

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.020
The giant method takes an argument that specifies the character you want to use as a separator to transform

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.430
the area into a string of another.

20
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.170
You can just ride in any kind of that argument as a parameter and that is going to be specified.

21
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.520
What I'm talking is that can give you an example of that.

22
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.660
So, for example, you have, let's say X equals to a set of areas.

23
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.810
And in that, let's say you have got Debow.

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.120
And then you have got Ben, let's say you have got, let's say, benzyl.

25
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.310
And let's say you have got a chair as well.

26
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.820
So these are the four elements you have in this area where you can do over here is that you can use

27
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.120
the drying method over here.

28
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.360
So we are going to write in.

29
00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.160
One more variable over here, so that it be and so that it looks much more like John dropping, so it

30
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.760
is going to be equal to X dot joint.

31
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.100
And what you can do is that you can just write a separator in between.

32
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.300
So if this is a single sentence, so what you want is that you want these all the stuff removed from

33
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.710
here and you want it to form a single sentence so you can just write in the separate overhead between

34
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.240
all of these elements around this code.

35
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.080
And you can see, all right, we have to just print it out as well.

36
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.380
So we're going to run anywhere here on this code.

37
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
And you can see that you have got all of this as a single statement table and then so chair and you

38
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.270
have got spaces in between all of these.

39
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.630
If you wanted each element to be separated by a comma and a space, you can use a comma and a space

40
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.360
as your delimiter over here.

41
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.830
So you can just write into a space where you can run this and you can see that you have got this.

42
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.200
So, for example, you have just a statement that says I.

43
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.380
And.

44
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.600
And and finally, you've got instructor over here.

45
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.750
So if you want to join them, you don't need this or underscored and you can see that it says I am an

46
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.350
instructor.

47
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.850
So that's why this joint function is going to work.

48
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.420
Now, if you don't specify an argument to the joint method, you will get a string, but it won't have

49
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.570
any kind of delimiter.

50
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.710
So if you just remove this from here or on this goal, you are going to see that you have got I am an

51
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.360
instructor and you've got no kind of special spaces in between this.

52
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.480
So using the joint method in conjunction with the map is going to be a quick way to transform an area

53
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.610
of data into an output.

54
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.960
Now use the map to transform each element in the data.

55
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.050
Then use the giant to transform the whole thing into a string you can print out now.

56
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.450
Remember our example of transforming this?

57
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.370
I am an instructor line area into an HDMI elements.

58
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.890
We have in the previous year when we were using the tablature thing and we converted into the HDMI in

59
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.740
which we enclose it in the option deck.

60
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.340
Now, here we are going to use the same example again, but this time we will use the joint to convert

61
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.040
the array of elements into a string with newline character as the separator.

62
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.650
So what we are going to do over here is that we are going to use, let's say, this very same Aubagio,

63
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.720
that is I am an instructor and I'm going to first use the map function.

64
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.340
So Oakhill, what I'm going to write and I'm going to write an obesity.

65
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.910
Equal to.

66
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.260
X dot map.

67
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.450
And in here, I'm going to define the variable Y and I'm going to write and these.

68
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.840
Option tags are here.

69
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.600
And I'm going to use interpolation to write in this wiwa here.

70
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.320
And finally, I'm going to close the option tag as well.

71
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.030
So now what I'm going to do is now I'm going to use the joint function of here as well.

72
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.650
So what I'm going to do is that I'm going to write in.

73
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.410
Output.

74
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.990
Is equal to whatever is the result of this.

75
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.070
I'm going to read an op ed dot.

76
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.510
Join and what I'm going to do is that in the previous year, you can you would have noticed that it

77
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.450
appeared and the default format.

78
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.750
So now what you can do is that you can use the separator of your own choice.

79
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.300
So in here, let's I want the separator to be a new line space.

80
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.940
We'll just remove this from here.

81
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.900
We don't need this anymore because we have got to output in a separate line now and you can just right

82
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:51.700
and put out run this code and you can see that you have got every tag in a separate line just because

83
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.770
of this giant function, if you want it, as they just separated by some line space is run this.

84
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.190
You can see that you have got everyone separated by a line speed.

85
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.280
So that's how you can use the map function in conjunction with the joint method.

86
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.280
And that is a very helpful thing to do.

87
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.580
Now, instead of converting an area to a stream, you might want to get a total of its content or perform

88
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.290
some kind of other transformation that result in a single value as well.

89
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.140
But that is what is a part of the next tutorial.

90
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.670
So what is the Dorelle?

91
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.170
That's it.

92
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.440
Thank you so much, guys, for watching and I will see you guys in the next tutorial.
