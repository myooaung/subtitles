Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.110
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to enter the tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.730
And in this story, we are going to cover that include Method and Ruby, not include is a strange class

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.830
method in Ruby, which is used to return.

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.540
True, if a given string contains the given string or character you have specified.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.140
Now the syntax for that is quite simple, as you can see over here as well.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.050
It is string what you want to check and then you have to write and not include.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.420
So after that include what you have to do is to specify the string you want to check.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.500
That is going to be string one.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.250
So let's just do it.

11
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.970
All right.

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.390
So let's say you have, let's say a string that is.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:52.160
Tutorials and you want to check if, let's say Y equals, do you want to check if X.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Include a question mark and you want to check it to is a part of this, as you can see, that you have

15
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.240
got this two over here.

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.830
So what do you have to do is that you will write in votes while we're here on this court.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.860
And as you can see, that it has returned.

18
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.140
Now it has returned true because.

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.480
This ex basically contains this do not, for example, right into your s O'Hare or underscored it is

20
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.110
going to return false because S is not a part of this now is not going to check for a random sequence,

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.590
because if you.

22
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.830
Right.

23
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.860
And let's say the well run the score, it is going to return false because steel is not present here

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.640
in the combined form D is there or is there, is there.

25
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.840
But they have to be together because we have specified a sequence of characters over here.

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.160
We have not specified something like the comma, let's say, or and then let's say you've got Alawa

27
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.220
here and we have not run like that.

28
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.730
And if you do it like that, it is also going to generate errors because you can not check for multiple

29
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.870
characters like this.

30
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.530
So you can just specify like this and it is going to return.

31
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050
True, because this is a part of this.

32
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:15.780
So that's how you can check if a certain sequence of characters are included in a string or not.

33
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.740
So I guess a simple tutorial.

34
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.150
That's what it.

35
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.770
Thank you so much for watching.

36
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.540
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
