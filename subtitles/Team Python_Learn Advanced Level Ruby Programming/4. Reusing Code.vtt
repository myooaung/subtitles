Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.270
This is American, and I welcome you to an editorial on the scores on Ruby and in this story.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.170
And we are going to be talking about one of the advantage of using function that is reusing code now

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.670
to reuse a code.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.480
Basically, it has two advantages.

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.950
The first one is that you don't have to repeat a code and then secondly, you can use are required code

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.830
again and again anywhere in your program.

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.780
So I guess I don't need to talk about it much.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.730
Let me just show you some examples so I will move on to my editor and let's say I have a function over

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.720
here and then this is the online for that and this is the calling card.

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.180
So, for example, I have certain lines of code over here, which I want to use again and again.

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
So what I want to do is that let's say I will just.

13
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.560
Right, and it's a.

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.230
Not all of that stuff, that is something, Beldin.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.510
All right, so then let's say I have to b and then let's say I have Pottsy.

16
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.420
So let's say I just run the score and you can see that I've got a BCO here.

17
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.630
So let's say after this function is called, I have let's say.

18
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.100
What's the deal here and let's say now I have both Oesterheld and then let's say I want to call this

19
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.330
ABC O'Haire again, so instead of diving, puts a puts the Putsy body again or hear what I can do is

20
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.080
that I can simply call this function.

21
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
So basically, this is a code that is going to be repeated.

22
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.790
So instead of writing that code again and again, because not only it is going to waste your time,

23
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.960
but it is also going to waste some resources of your program.

24
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.800
OHAYON So you can just call this function, run this code.

25
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.330
And as you can see that you've got ABC then and then ABC right over here.

26
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.540
So this is a very big advantages, advantage of using function.

27
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780
That is that you don't have to repeat a code.

28
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.350
And the second one was how to use the required code.

29
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.710
So you can just simply call a function and you can use the required code.

30
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.630
So when you are running extensive programs, not only the functions are going to organize your code,

31
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.020
but it is also going to shorten your code because a certain lines of code, which is going to be repeated

32
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.790
again and again, again and again, what you can do is that you can just put it in a function and then

33
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.370
instead of writing the whole piece of code again, you can just simply write a single line.

34
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.590
And that single line is basically calling that function.

35
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.580
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

36
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.170
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

37
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.180
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
