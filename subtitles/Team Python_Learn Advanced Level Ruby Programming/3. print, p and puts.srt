00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,020
Hey, guys, what's up this summer, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Aruba.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,600
And in this story, we are going to see that how to put things on the screen directly, which means

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,780
that how to output things the very same way we just write them.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,700
So there are three methods for doing it.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,630
The first method is sports.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,250
Now, the sports and the print command are both used to display the results of the evaluating Aruba

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,700
code.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:37,320
The next method is the easy method, like sports, the outputs, the next, along with a new line character.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,250
But it also includes double quotes around text that has been outputted.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,100
And the third one is spread, which is a tool.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,030
You is the very same lightbox and the print method is to put the same text on the screen as written

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,010
in the parenthesis.

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,510
So let me just show you the difference between the three methods.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,750
The port's method basically pulls the string on the screen and also adds a new line space, whereas

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,890
in print method, if you want to add a space, you have to specify it yourself using the backslash and

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,210
whereas the ping outputs the next, along with a new line character.

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,370
But it also includes double gorz around the text that has been outputted.

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,590
So let me just show you a quick example of how all these three are going to work, so I'll just move

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,850
on to my compiler, that is Adam Brunner and Ohare.

20
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,880
We are going to start on with the first one that is the Put's method.

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,050
So you have to just write in votes and then you have to specify these columns and then you can just

22
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,790
type in any string.

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,460
For example, I want to just type in hello and then let's see wood.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,100
So I'm going to just press on last hour and that is going to print my output now.

25
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,560
For example, if I want to put in something else over here like Bode's.

26
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,110
And I'm going to just step in and.

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,230
Fellows, so hello, World and Fellows does not make any sense, but does it matter?

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,280
So as you can see that what Woods has done is that it has automatically added a new line space after

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,060
the second one.

30
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:30,680
So I haven't specified Backslash and Oakhill, but it has automatically added a new line space for the

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,750
second course I have specified.

32
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,150
Now, the second method that is the best method, if I just replace words with B and now press all plus

33
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,810
are you can see that the same thing has been printed.

34
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,340
But as you can see that double courts have been added and that is what is the difference between bots

35
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,270
and beep so.

36
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,110
New space has been added without a backslash and the very same posted, but as I told you, the difference

37
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,840
is that Democrats have been added around a string, which means that basically the whole part of this

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,500
is brain dead.

39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,640
So now, if I replace both of these with the third method to output string on the screen, that is Sprent.

40
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,690
Now, all plus are you can see that the double courts are missing as well as the new line space is missing

41
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,170
here as well.

42
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:28,220
As you can see that and phallus is printed right after this word is printed and no line space has been

43
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,970
added over here.

44
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,130
And that is what is the difference between the three matters.

45
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,380
Now, if you want to specify a line special here, what you have to do is that you specify backslash

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:36,770
and.

47
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,660
And that is going to do your job, so just press are and as you can see, that deadline has now been

48
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,590
added, but that is the line space that has been added due to this backslash.

49
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,870
And whereas the other two methods do it by default.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,810
And if you're using print, you have to do it yourself and you have to add this backslash number here.

51
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:06,410
So that's how basically output can be generated on the screen the very same way it is on the ATM runner.

52
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,030
So I guess you have understood the three matters to put strings on the screen, so I guess that's it

53
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,960
with this tutorial.

54
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you so much, gas, for watching.

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,340
I'll see you guys in the next Dorio.
