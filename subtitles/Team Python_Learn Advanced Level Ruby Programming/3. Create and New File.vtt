Hey, guys, this is a and I welcome you to another Dorelle on this course on Druyun and this story,

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.430
we are going to see how to create a new file in Ruby.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.760
New ones are created in Ruby using the new method of the five.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.740
The new method except two arguments.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.680
The first is the name of the file that you want to create, and the second is the mode in which you

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.250
want the file to open.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.700
So if you talk about the syntax for how to open, how to create a new file, then that is it.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.800
Right here you have to create an object file.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.130
Then you have to write in file equal to file dot new and then you have to specify two parameters.

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.600
The first one is going to be the name of the file, along with the format in which, for example, if

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.580
you want to create a text file, if you want to create a PDF file or whatever you want to create, you

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.620
have to specify that up to the dot operator over here and then you have to write in the mode in which

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.560
you want to open this file.

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.640
So let me give you a quick example for how to create a file and where that file is going to get created

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.670
in your PC.

16
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.330
So just move want to them and here but you have to do is just create an object file.

17
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.380
Right, and file.

18
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.980
Darte.

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.870
New ad in the parameters you have to write in to do things, the first thing is the name of the file

20
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.980
along with the format.

21
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.640
So let's say I want to create a text file that is a text file.

22
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.300
And the second parameter is going to be the mode in which you want to open this file.

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.090
So let's say I want this file to be all right file.

24
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.520
So I want to give the right only access to this file.

25
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.050
So if I just run this code, you can see that it has run perfectly.

26
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.090
Now in your computer, just move on to the documents folder and in the documents folder, you can see

27
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.850
that you have got this file right over here.

28
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.220
And if you just go into the properties of that file, you can see that it has.

29
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.460
So I guess it is.

30
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.410
I should just open it.

31
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.660
And you can see that you have got this file, you can just open it with Microsoft Word as well if you

32
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.870
want to just go on search for another app and just go with Microsoft.

33
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.980
So this is a file that has been created with the name file and it has only the right access.

34
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.070
So that is basically how you can create a new file in Ruby.

35
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.440
And that is the simplest way of how to create a new file.

36
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.500
If you want to create a new file, let's say file one, just use the same command that is written over

37
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.730
here.

38
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.910
So just copy this.

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.120
Binsted Ohala just change its name to, let's say this time file start to run this code and you can

40
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.450
see that it has run perfectly.

41
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.510
Go back and you can see that now you have got a file folder as well.

42
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.210
So I guess that's it.

43
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.120
We have created two files in the next story.

44
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.760
We are going to see more on file.

45
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.000
So stay tuned for that.

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.580
Thank you so much for now.

47
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.390
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
