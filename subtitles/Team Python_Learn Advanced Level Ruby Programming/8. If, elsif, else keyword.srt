00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,470
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,080
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to another tutorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,510
And in this drill, we are going to start on with the flow control, key words.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,110
And the first key word we are going to cover is the if statement.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,310
Now, if key word is used to check up an expression is true or not, if it is true, a set of statement

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,720
is going to be executed.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,130
Now, the statement can be a single line or it can be a compound statement.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,730
Now, a compound statement basically consist of multi-line statements that are enclosed by a block.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,710
And you know that a block is a code that is always enclosed by the end.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,280
Key word.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,310
Now here we can also use the then word, but the key word is basically optional.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,320
So if you talk about the syntax for how it is going to use so this is basically the syntax for that,

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,660
you have to specify if then you have to write in the condition, then you have to write and then but

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,250
this Denoyer here is optional.

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,830
If you don't want to use it, even then it is going to act in the very same way, but it is only added

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,280
to make it look a bit more handsome.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,340
So if you want to specify it, just specify it.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,770
But if you don't want to specify it, don't do it.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,240
And after that, when you click enter, you are automatically going to enter a block and that block

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,690
you are going to write in the statements that you want to execute if this condition is true.

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,900
So whatever condition you have specified here, if it is true, then the statements you have specified

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,080
over here, it can be a single statement or it can be compound statements.

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,370
Those statements are going to get executed and all the statements starting on from that then and then

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,470
ending on with this and keyword.

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,880
All those statements are going to get executed if this condition is true.

26
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:57,660
Then we have as if statements in which basically we are using multiple ifs and the syntax for that is

27
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,800
right or here you can write and if you can write in condition number one, then you can write in the

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,390
statements you want to execute a condition.

29
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,170
No one is true.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,280
Then you can write an E Alekseyev that stand for else if which means that if the first condition is

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,500
not true, then you want to check in the second condition.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,180
Then the second condition is true.

33
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,070
You want a set of statements to get executed and when you want to end it, you can just write in and

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,440
O'Hare.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,450
So these are basically also called s multiple if statements, but in programming it is called S else

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,330
F then you have the L statement that is also used in combination with the F condition and you cannot

37
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,860
use if condition alone.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:41,100
You also always have to use it with a condition so you can as you can see right in F condition, number

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,330
one statement to execute, then you can write and else if condition number two you can write and then

40
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,730
you can then write the conditions you want to execute.

41
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,050
If condition number two is true, then you can write an S and then you can write in the statements to

42
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,750
get executed and the statements to execute it in the else block are going to get executed in both.

43
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,760
The condition above are false and you can just use elsewhere the signal condition as well.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,490
And you can use the Aylsworth three conditions as well, but you can not use it alone.

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,720
You always have to use it whether if condition.

46
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,010
So we have to talk about the syntax of all of the three.

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,710
Keywords that are basically associated with if the first one is if it's self, then you have the Alsup

48
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,320
and then you have the Wolski word.

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,610
So let's just try all of these three on our ED.

50
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,170
So let's move on to Adam.

51
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:35,230
And what we are going to do is that let's say I want to calculate, let's say the result for a student.

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,230
So let's say we have a variable that is Moggs and let's say the marks of the students are, let's say

53
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,920
85.

54
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:51,740
So what I want to do away here is that I want to specify if marks are greater than, let's say, 80.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Then what I want is that I want to put.

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,250
You have.

57
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,470
Secured.

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,820
Good marks.

59
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,600
So simple enough, so if the Moncks, which you have entered over here are greater than 80, which means

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,160
that if this condition is true, then it is going to execute this statement right over here that says

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,290
you have secured good marks and you can just ride in and out here, run the score.

62
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,920
And as you can see, that it is processing it.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,110
And as you can see that it has printed out, you have secured good marks because this condition right

64
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,080
over here is true.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,150
So, for example, let's say this condition is not true, which means that it is, let's say 70.

66
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,630
Now, this marks are not greater than 70.

67
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,190
Run this discord and.

68
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes, it is, again, greater than 70, you have to write in something bigger.

69
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,790
Sorry, my bad.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,700
So to right in 91, this good.

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,940
And as you can see, that it has existed, but you can see that nothing is being printed because this

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,900
condition was not true.

73
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,580
It came out nothing after that.

74
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,030
So nothing was printed on the atom there as well.

75
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:07,060
Now comes the then key word, if you want to use the Denki, whatever hair you can ride in a hair underscored,

76
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,860
nothing is going to get printed, make it through, let's say, 80 around the school and it is going

77
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,340
to print out.

78
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,480
You have secured good marks.

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,870
So this denki whatever hair is optional, this is going to print in both the ways either.

80
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,600
If you specify then a hair and if you don't specify the no hair even then it is going to get printed,

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,440
which means the if condition is not dependent on this Denki word.

82
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:39,140
Now, secondly comes the elusive key word that is basically used if you want to check in multiple conditions

83
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,910
now, for example, you want to check in for, let's say, more tanks than you can just ride in.

84
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,590
You have secured.

85
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,460
A great.

86
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,580
So if the marks are greater than 80, what do you want to do is that or let's say just make it 90?

87
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,780
So if the marks are greater than 90, then you want to write and you have secured a grade, then you

88
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,090
can write an E as I f.

89
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,420
I'll save the marks if there are greater than, let's say, 80.

90
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,620
Then what you're going to do is that you are going to put.

91
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,840
You have.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,100
Secured the great.

93
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,280
Then you can check on for one more condition, let's say, if.

94
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,210
The marks are greater than, let's say, 70.

95
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,800
Then what you're going to do is that you're going to put.

96
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,690
You have secured.

97
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,410
Secret.

98
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,810
So I guess that's enough.

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,040
You already have this and O'Haire, so just run the score and as you can see that it is printed out.

100
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,140
You have secured the grid because this condition over here is true.

101
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,630
That is Mok's is greater than 80.

102
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,890
Now, one thing you need to know over here more is that this condition over here, as you can see,

103
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:10,520
is also true because 85, which is what is stored in this box, is also greater than 70.

104
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,890
And this condition over here is also true.

105
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,030
Then why did it only printed it out?

106
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,230
This it should also have printed out this as well.

107
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,090
But as you can see that since it is a single block which start on from this if and it ends on with this

108
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,950
and keyword.

109
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,800
So that's what it is basically a single kind of thing.

110
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,540
You can just call it a single block.

111
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,330
So if any of the conditions over here is true, for example, since this condition was true, this was

112
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,390
also just skip this and it starts on to check the second condition now when the second condition was

113
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,820
true.

114
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:52,060
So what it did is that it printed out whatever was in the statements of this second keyword.

115
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,640
It printed out those because the second condition was true.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,360
It printed out.

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,160
You have secured the grade and it will simply skip all the lines after that.

118
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:08,860
So this means that it did not even check this third condition, because since it has found the result,

119
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,720
it don't have to check for any other condition.

120
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,870
So this statement over here did not even get executed.

121
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,030
So if it did not get executed, so that's why you have not got you have your cigarette on your screen.

122
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,480
So always remember that if you have multiple if you are using the elusive oakhill.

123
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,720
So if one condition is true, all the conditions after that are simply going to get ignored, even if

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,500
they are true.

125
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,730
So that's why you have this output out here.

126
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,900
Then comes the third key word.

127
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,430
That is the Wolski word.

128
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
And you are going to also use it in this blog.

129
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,570
So you're going to just write and else click, enter and you can just write in both.

130
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,180
And you can simply ride and you failed.

131
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,710
So if his marks are less than 70, which means he failed.

132
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,970
These are not the marks you are going to get failed on, but let it be so.

133
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,900
Just run the score and it is going to bring down the second same output.

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,040
So let's say we enter something which is less than 70, which means all these three conditions over

135
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,990
here are false.

136
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,340
So now run the score and it is going to print out.

137
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,740
You fail.

138
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,310
So if all the conditions above the EL statement are false.

139
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,060
Then whatever the condition is, whatever statements you have written in the else block are going to

140
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,120
get executed, so you can call it a mini block for this.

141
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,050
This is the major block in which all these statements are present.

142
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,930
You can call all of these as many blogs.

143
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,620
Then this is going to be the first milblog.

144
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,690
This is the second block.

145
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,810
This is the third block.

146
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,270
And this is the fourth block.

147
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,640
So the fourth mini block, which is for the LS Keywood.

148
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,700
And whatever statements are in that mini block, those statements are going to get executed if all the

149
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,710
statements above that are false.

150
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:04,270
Now, one thing over here is that can you specify one more elusive after you have specified this so

151
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,560
you can just write in, for example, as if Mark's.

152
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,710
Let's say we write an equal equal to 60, which is true.

153
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,630
You are going to write in votes.

154
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,070
You secured.

155
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,150
Sixty, let's say so run this code now, and as you can see, that it has generated an error message.

156
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,960
That is because the URLs should always be at the very, very, very end after, as you cannot specify,

157
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,660
or else if you want to use another Allsup and you want to use if you want to check on with another condition,

158
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,640
you have to just move out of this blog and you have to create a new blog with this if and statement

159
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,070
over here.

160
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:55,760
So I guess that's clear with the if saeki what we have covered if condition we have covered El-Sayed.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,560
That is basically the multiple FS condition and we have used the L word as well.

162
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,270
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

163
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,920
Thank you so much guys, for watching.

164
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,180
I'll see you guys in the next Derryl with a Newquay word.
