00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,410
Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,850
This was an air horn, and I welcome you to another drill on this course on Dhruva.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,300
And as in the introduction of the section, I told you that we will be discussing about operators for

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,650
the first type of operators.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,920
We are going to be discussing are the Artomatic operators.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,420
Now, Artomatic operator basically take numeric value as their options and they return a single numeric

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:24,810
value.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,560
The standard Artomatic operators are basically the additions struction, multiplication division and

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,930
some others that are listed right on this slide or held.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,170
So on the table, you can see that we have got, I guess, six operators, the first one is additional

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,180
operator four, which is plus.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,850
And to use it, you have to specify it between two options then is the subtraction.

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,270
Then we have the multiplication, then we have the division, and then we have the modulus and then

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,910
we have the exponent sign finally.

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:10,810
So I guess that is a very simple thing, 99 percent of you know about what I'm talking about.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,960
So let's just see some examples and just wrap this topic.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,900
So I'll just move on to the Adam compiler here.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,090
So starting on the very first one is the boat's operator.

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,690
So I just write in boats.

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
And we will specify.

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,890
Addition operator.

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,430
And then we'll just dive in boats and let's say that we want to add two numbers, so let's say the two

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,260
numbers are five and then we specify plus operator and then six.

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,590
So that is going to do our job and it is going to perform that.

25
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:58,450
Even if I just press all plus Arawa here, as you can see that it says addition operator and some for

26
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,220
the two operators has been printed successfully.

27
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,200
Now to talk about the second operator.

28
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,440
We will just move to the next line.

29
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,640
Will just put.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,090
And it is basically the subtraction.

31
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:25,770
And we will just ride in boats and they will just say, let's say nine minus and then six and pressing

32
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,720
all plus are going to give you this corrected some that it's three.

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,570
Then the next one is the multiplication operator.

34
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,550
So just specify multiply Woodhill.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,980
New line thoughts, and let's just say I want to specify five, Starick, six, or Starick is basically

36
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,060
use for multiplication press or Pessah, and it is going to give you the product of the two numbers

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,440
then Duduk about the fourth one, that is.

38
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:06,360
Division lies just divide two numbers that specify that I want to divide, let's say 30 divided by,

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,830
let's say six.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,450
So Press or Pessah and it is going to give you the divided some.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,200
And analysts thought.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:24,020
The next one that is the power operator that is also known as the exponentiation, so we will just write

43
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,740
and.

44
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,940
Power, and then we would just specify boats and let's say I want to give three.

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,180
Due to slow press, all plans are and it is going to give you nine, which is three to raise to the

46
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,870
power to.

47
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,150
And then the last one is the modulo operator that is going to basically give you the remainder, so

48
00:03:53,270 --> 00:04:00,140
will just ride in Rimando Hill, ride in boats, and let's say you want to divide the number that does

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,720
not divide successfully.

50
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,490
So they just ride in 14, divided by five, and it will have the remainder.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,780
So just press all plus R and four is the remainder after dividing 14 by five.

52
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,280
So basically, he does a very simple concept, you have added two numbers subtracted, multiplied,

53
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,940
divided Diegan, the power rest with respect to some other number, you have also taken the remainder

54
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,360
after dividing the two numbers.

55
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,250
So if you talk about the Ruby division operator, then it has certain things in it, more so let's just

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,900
remove all this stuff from here.

57
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,720
But it will help now, as you can see that if you just press all this, ah, this is the divided sum

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,490
that has been divided very successfully because it has got no kind of remender with it.

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,500
Now, what if you put in.

60
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,490
Some number, let's say, that does not divide successfully, let's say 14 divided by five, as we did

61
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,660
in the previous example.

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,980
So now plus all plus hour and it is going to give you two, which means that it has truncated the remainder

63
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,380
part.

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:15,120
So what if you want to, let's say, divide a number, let's say thirty point zero and you want to let's

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,170
say divided by, let's say five.

66
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,300
Again, press alters are and it is going to give you the sum in decimal point.

67
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,520
As you can see that this is in decimal point.

68
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,740
This is not in decimal point.

69
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:35,490
Even then, it is going to consider this one and it is going to give you this answer in floating point

70
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,880
number.

71
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,740
Or you can say the decimal point number.

72
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,930
Now, what if both of these are, let's say, a decimal point, not all plus are, and it is going to

73
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,760
give you the very same answer, that is six point zero, the answer that is in decimal point.

74
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,560
Now, if you want to talk about the unary operators over here, so we will just be using these.

75
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,340
So, for example, you want to type in the last 30 and let's say you want to add it.

76
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:15,900
Well, let's say minus six, so if you just remove this from help, remove this and just dive in.

77
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,760
Entrances and press orders are added, you can see that it has given you 24, which means that it has

78
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,280
considered it as a negative number.

79
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,670
This as a positive number.

80
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,590
It has put the brackets on these numbers by default and generated the answer for you.

81
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,380
That is twenty four an hour, for example.

82
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,650
This is a negative number.

83
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,150
And let's say this is a positive number, so you don't have to add anything.

84
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,670
Go ahead.

85
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,030
Is going to treat it as by default Kressel plus hour and it is going to give you minus 24.

86
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,680
And now let's say both these numbers are negative press.

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,140
All plus are it is going to add these two numbers, add a negative sign at the start and give you minus

88
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,060
36 over here.

89
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,140
Good enough.

90
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,780
Now, for example, you want to, let's say, multiply unary numbers.

91
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,300
For example, I want to add a stereo here.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,050
Let's just shorten this number to five and now Breus all plus are, and as you can see, that it has

93
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,330
generated 30 because minus minus equals to plus and six plus five security.

94
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:26,440
So the Ruby compiler, the Adam compiler over here is smart enough to understand all the signs and perform

95
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,320
these arithmetic operations for you guys.

96
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,660
So I hope it is very much clear.

97
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,440
It is a very easy concept.

98
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,800
Almost 99 percent of you know what I'm doing.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,460
But I have just done all of these to you in the programming language.

100
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,070
So that's how Artomatic operators are used in Ruby.

101
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,270
So I guess that's it with this tutorial.

102
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,210
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

103
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,640
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
