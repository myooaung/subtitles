Hey, guys, what's up?

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.400
This is a marathon, and I welcome you to an editorial on this course on Ruby.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.020
And in this studio, we are again going to be covering two functions that are the cover and exclude

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.060
and function.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.320
So starting on with the first function, that is the cover function, which is an invalid method in

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.310
Ruby that returns a boolean value.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.550
True at the given object lies within the given range as it is going to return false.

8
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.310
Now the object can be an element or it can be arranged.

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.670
So if you talk about the syntax for this, it is going to be range, not color.

10
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.030
And as you can see that you have got a parameter and it is basically the function except an object which

11
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.640
is to be checked for.

12
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.640
And as I told you about the return value that it is going to return boolean value.

13
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.730
True, if the given object lies within the given range as it is going to return false, then talking

14
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.830
about the second function we are going to be covering in this tutorial is to exclude and function and

15
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.420
exclude and is an invalid method in Ruby that returns boolean value.

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.490
True, if the range exclude its end value as it is going to return false.

17
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.160
And it has a very simple syntax.

18
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.350
You have to write and arrange one, not exclude and a score, and you have to write in a question mark.

19
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.630
And as you can see that you have got no kind of parameters and the return value is again going to be

20
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.590
a boolean value.

21
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.970
True, if the range excludes and value, El-Sayed is going to return false.

22
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.220
So let's just cover two simple examples for how these two functions can be used with ranges.

23
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.560
So we will move on to Adam.

24
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.590
And the first function is basically the cover function.

25
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.990
So for that we need a range.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
Let's say we have a range from zero to 10 this time.

27
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.940
And what we are going to write in, we are going to write and post one.

28
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.640
Range, dot cover, you're going to ride in a question mark and we are going to ride the element we

29
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.120
want to inspect for, so you just ride and Dual Hill.

30
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.450
Is good, it is going to return true, as I told you, that it returns a boolean value of the given

31
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.530
object lies within the given range as it is going to return false.

32
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.850
So this function also works the very same way, like include.

33
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.620
And if you just write and let's say like, well, that is not a part of it and is going to simply return

34
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.190
false.

35
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.580
Then talking about the second function we are going to be covering is that exclude, underscore and

36
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.110
and of questionmark function.

37
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.870
So if you just write and arrange with it, you don't exclude and run.

38
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.040
It is going to return us now from the previous editorials, you know, the difference between a dot

39
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.320
dot and a dot operator.

40
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.920
And now you know that in the dot operator, the and element that is Denoyer is going to be included

41
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.380
as well.

42
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.690
But if you use that triple dot, you know that the last element is going to get excluded.

43
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.920
So for this very same range we have right over here, if you just write in zero, dot, dot, dot,

44
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.330
dot, then run this code.

45
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.520
You can see that now you have got trouble here because now the last element has been excluded from this

46
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.630
range you have.

47
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.500
Right or here.

48
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.500
So that's how basically you can have the exclude and function used and you can see that if you have

49
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.700
this last element missing from that or not.

50
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.760
So as it is obvious from its name as well that it is going to return.

51
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.570
True, if the end is excluded and that and it's only excluded if you use three dots right away.

52
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.360
But if you use to dots, you know that the end is going to be included and it is going to then return

53
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.810
false.

54
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.020
So I guess that's it with these two functions as well.

55
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.900
Thank you so much, guys, for watching.

56
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.300
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
