00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
everybody.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.260
My name is Jordan and we're in this course to teach our dogs How do not jump on people A

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.160
limit of my back stories that I've kind of worked in every aspect of the dog world from a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.750
kennel assistant picking up,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.410
you know,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.240
the unmentionables to that assistant to that tech to animal Patrol officer to eventually a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.930
dog trainer.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.390
And it was as a dog trainer.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.360
I felt like I was able to do the most good for the most amount of dogs.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.440
And I was really limited by only the people and dogs that I could get in personal contact

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.660
with.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.020
So I wanted to start these courses to be able to share this information with as many people

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.950
as possible so that more dogs and more people can live happy lives.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.150
In this course,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.760
we're gonna learn how to better communicate with our dogs.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.640
We're gonna learn how to get them to understand what we want from them and what we don't

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.500
want from them.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.660
We're going to start a class project,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.890
which is just going to be,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.570
um,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.960
a video of progress video of what your dog does right now to what they do at the end of

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.980
your training with them and get to the refund result of them not jumping on anybody,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.630
Um,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.350
in public as well is when people come to your house the point of taking these video

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.170
snapshots of progress of your dog s so that you can see how far they've come from,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.920
where from,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.420
where they started to where they end up and be able to really compare how much progress

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.890
you've made through your training.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.890
-

00:01:30.890 --> 00:02:03.490
All

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.950
right,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.720
that all sounds good to you.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.800
Let's get on to the next section and talk about why dogs jump on people in the first place

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.800
.
