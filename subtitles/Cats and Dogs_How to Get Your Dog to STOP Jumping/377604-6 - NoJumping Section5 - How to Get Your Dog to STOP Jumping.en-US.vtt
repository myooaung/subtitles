00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
all right,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.620
he admitted this far.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.650
Now you have to practice and practice in practice,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.330
practicing your kitchen practice in your living room.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.880
Practice at your front door,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.850
practice at the vet's office at the Dip Doggie Daycare at the dog park.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.630
We want to practice this in every scenario and every environment.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.670
One thing I can tell you about dogs is that they do not contextualized well,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.750
and what that means is what we tell them in the kitchen,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.420
or what we tell them in our house does not automatically apply for them in other

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.110
environments.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.030
The set of rules changes for every environment we go to and this kind of true for humans to

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.800
we act differently that we at home then we would at work than we do out socializing than we

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.420
do at the movie theater than we do so.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.980
But certain things are always the same and less willing to teach our dogs it.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.050
Sometimes the things we asked at home do you still apply other places,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.470
so if sit means sit at home and it means sit in the kitchen,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.710
it means sit in the living room and the bedroom in the front door It has also mean sit

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.360
everywhere else.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.820
So we need to practice this.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.870
Your dog is not going to automatically know that they're not allowed to jump down people

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.990
once you step out your front door until you practice outside your front door And they're

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.500
not gonna know this at the dog park unless you practice at the dog park.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.550
They're not gonna know this at the Met office.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.530
If you don't practice at the that office,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.250
you have to practices and enough environments that the dog generalizes the whole concept of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.740
I am not allowed to jump on people.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.900
The only way I get attention from people is my sitting or whatever you want your dog to do

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.900
.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.270
It is very,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.270
very important to help you avoid frustration because you're gonna work really hard at home

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.760
and you're gonna get your dog would never jumps on guessed,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.110
right.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.510
But then you're gonna go for a walk or you're gonna go to the vet's office.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.350
And the first thing that when they meet a new person,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.590
they're gonna go back to that old habit and be excited and want to jump on somebody.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.750
Now we're gonna prevent that the same way we prevented it at home,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470
and we're gonna react with the same way we reacted to it at home.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.520
The more places you practice,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.550
the better your dog is gonna understand This plain and simple,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.790
it is going to take repetitions in new environments over and over and over again until they

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.950
really understand what you are looking for from them.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.170
So please don't get frustrated if you have ah,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.860
super well behaved dog in the house and you've gotten them to not jump on people in the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.410
house.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.040
Please don't get frustrated if you take this show on the road and you get out on the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.750
sidewalk and they start jumping on people you haven't practiced on the sidewalk yet.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.370
Practice on the sidewalk,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.140
practice,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.510
practice,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.640
practice and then you will be able to have a better expectation of where they're at

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.460
practice,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.990
practice,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.720
practice.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.540
You are not gonna be able to get the same behavior that you got at home outside your front

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.260
door automatically.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.730
It's gonna take practice in every environment for this toe.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.950
Work in every environment.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.850
So now it's your job to go out in public,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.490
get your phone out and to get videos of your dog interacting with people in public and not

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.250
jumping on that.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.370
Try at least 45 different places.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.510
There's a great list of dog friendly retailers on the Web.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.120
Um,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.080
obviously,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.260
like places like PetSmart,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.970
Petco Dog.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.450
Uh,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.330
you know,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.220
pet stores are pretty from pretty.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.000
Okay with you bringing dogs in and working on this as well is just on your front sidewalk

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.050
or at the coffee shop around the corner that has outdoor seating,

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.790
any place that you can bring your dog and practices,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.450
the better.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.500
So for your class project,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.450
I want to see at least 3 to 5 public environments where you were working with your dog with

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.950
not jumping on people.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.850
Good luck.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.560
So here we have a clip of how to react.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.870
If the dog does jump,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.940
it's a simple Get the dog off,

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.640
get the dog to sit,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.100
and then immediately allow the doctor interact with the person as the reward for sitting in

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.590
this clip.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.650
The dog doesn't jump,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.130
but she doesn't sit either,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.640
so I make sure that she sits before she gets the reward of getting to interact with the new

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.190
person.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:32.600
So here's a clip of us out in public.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.830
We get,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.840
make it becomes it.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.820
She gives me appalling in my lap.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.240
First,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.470
I just kind of ignore that.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.270
Get her to sit.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.080
Then I let the new person interact with her.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:55.450
So in the second clip,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.780
because actually laying in front of me and I still ask her to sit before she can interact

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.750
with the new person.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.220
This is really important for consistency.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.210
The objective is to get her to sit for interaction each time,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.950
as the final piece of your class project.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.940
I want you to take a final video of you and your dog,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.250
greeting each other in a calm manner and being proud of how far you've come.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.640
And I want you to submit it to the class as well as I want you to be able to share that on

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.500
social media.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.890
It's gonna be one of these great things that you could be really proud of.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.440
And the beautiful thing is,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.450
you can use these techniques to start teaching your dog all sorts of other things
