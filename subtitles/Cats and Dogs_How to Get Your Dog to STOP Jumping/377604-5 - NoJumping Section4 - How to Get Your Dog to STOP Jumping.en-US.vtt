00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
Okay,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.500
so we talked about how to prevent the behavior from happening,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.580
and we talked about what we're gonna do to be proactive.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.450
Now,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.310
let's say we're a little less prepared and we have to react to something,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.680
whether that means the doorbell rang.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.260
We're not ready.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.320
We weren't expecting it or someone walks up to us and we weren't expecting it or out on a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.750
walk.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.100
This is how we react to the dog about the jump on someone or already have been jumped on

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.860
somebody first and foremost.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.100
What did you tell your dog you wanted them to do before jumping on somebody or to get them

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.350
to not jump on somebody?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.360
As we are conditioning our dogs to this new behavior and telling them what we want them to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.230
do instead,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.450
we need to can't stay consistent with that.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.450
So if you told your dog they have to sit every time before they meet a new person,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.930
then that's what you should be doing right before you think they're going to jump,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320
is direct all of your attention towards them.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.740
Maybe even step in between the dog,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.150
your dog and the new person,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.950
or the distracter and if you're the person that is distracting the delicate as you got home

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.950
,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.280
for example,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.890
you need to be able to understand you living to tell the dog to sit and and if they don't,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.700
you're gonna do the same things we talked about before turning away.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.720
Tell them no,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.740
don't touch them.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.340
Don't have eye contact with them.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.720
Remove your attention cause that's what they want.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.010
You're taking away what they want until they do what you want,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.150
which is to sit.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.000
So I want that sequence to look a little something like the dog gets excited,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.510
you can tell there about the jump.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.520
I want you to say Fido,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.830
sit and you can even add a little bit of an ex excited sound to your voice.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.910
They might be more apt to listen to you.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.290
Then,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.200
if they still don't sit right away,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.990
I would remove my attention from the dog so I would turn around.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.150
I would ignore them.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.460
I wouldn't talk to them.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.690
I would not make eye contact.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.600
And after saying no once I'm not going to speak to them anymore,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.120
either.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.270
I'm gonna remove myself away and not allow them to make contact with me.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.010
Ideally,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.390
you know,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.920
they're in Ah,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.740
on a leash where you can tie them up and get keeps.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.920
Keep yourself separated.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.740
If not,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.920
you might have to endure a little bit of pause on you until they stop the moment that they

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.470
stop.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.750
Start mentally counting in your head at least toe three seconds or five seconds and you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.840
want to build on that.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.330
So let's say the dog jumps on your jumps on your jumps on you puts all four paws on the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.670
ground.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.650
Count in your head.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.940
One.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.540
Mississippi,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.750
two.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.340
Mississippi,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.560
three.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.280
Mississippi.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.450
If they're still all four paws on the ground,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.610
try it,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.350
asking them to sit again if they sit run away.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.590
You know,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.210
good dog positive.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.460
Really,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.240
really more than,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.190
you know,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.180
Rub them on the head.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.750
Give them the attention that they're seeking.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.810
If,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.420
for some reason that they don't repeat and repeat and repeat,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.790
or if you don't get 2 to 3 seconds,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.970
it's okay to go to to.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.580
I would try to go for 1.5 seconds and minimally,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.280
but we really want to catch them with all four paws on the ground and then reward them for

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.250
being there and try to lengthen that time out before we have Teoh re engage with them.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.240
That also kind helps with you getting frustrated with.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.570
It's off,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.880
Off,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.140
off,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.430
down,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.680
down,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.020
down!

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.890
Since its it No,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.090
no,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.310
no,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.490
no.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.460
We don't want any of that.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.060
We just want single sit command.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.480
If they don't and they try to jump toward you or single No communication,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.750
that's not what you want.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.070
And then the the punishment or the um we're talking about negative and positive re

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.840
enforcers.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.800
The negative,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.350
uh,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.820
a side effect of them not listening is you're going to remove their your attention from

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.960
them and you're gonna remove that attention as long as it takes before they.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.300
So they do what you are expecting them to dio the moment they do the right thing.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.880
You need to switch gears,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.290
be kind of binary.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.850
It's either yes or no.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.550
Once they do the right thing,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.800
you just switch gears and reward them for that moment to keep them in that right state of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.950
mind like Wait,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.150
what am I doing now?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.840
That is now it was okay that I'm getting it.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.530
This attention that will eventually start to take after repetition after repetition,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.660
they're really gonna start to get.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.850
Then we'll click for them.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.750
But if you stay mad at them for jumping at you,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.080
you confuse the crap out of Okay,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.960
So here we have a clip of how to react.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.210
If the dog does jump,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.490
it's a simple Get the dog off,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.640
get the dog to sit and then immediately allow the dog to interact with the person as the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.250
reward for sitting.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:55.840
The other thing I want you to keep in mind is how you greet your dog.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.130
Now,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.710
how do you greet the other people in your house?

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.050
Whether you have roommates or your parents or your kids or what have you?

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.600
I guarantee you don't create them like Hi,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.150
how are you?

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.330
Well,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.880
that you get super excited normally interest like,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.200
Hey,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.850
how was your day?

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.840
That's how it should look for you and your dog.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.640
While your dog gets excited because you're excited,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.120
you get excited because your dogs excited.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.650
If you kind of kill that cycle of just like I was your day,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.940
Did you have a good day and just literally have that same conversation with the dog that

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.950
you will with a person,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.790
you're gonna help reduce a lot of that excitement and jumping that you get ideally,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.930
in my mind.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.070
I want a dog that sits attentively as I walk in and lets me take my coat off,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.060
Take my shoes off,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.690
get in the house and relax before I engage with them.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.140
So I have a little clip here of me and my dog.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.260
I'm coming in.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.850
I I'm actually trying to show you guys a little bit of how I test her and want to see that

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.560
she does not jump on me because that is just not allowed.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:09.350
And the only way to get my attention and be able to engage with me is by me asking for that

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.350
.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.450
So here's a clip.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:40.350
All right.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.370
It's your turn.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.630
Set up your cameras,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.510
set up your phone,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.020
get the next clip of your dog and how you're getting them to interact with new people or

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.850
yourself and watch your progress
