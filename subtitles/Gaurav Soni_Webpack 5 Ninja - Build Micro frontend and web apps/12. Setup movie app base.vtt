1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.930
In the last we did, we got all the things started, all the existing sale was started.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.610
Now we need to be moving on and see how we can re navigating between all those applications.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.410
So what is the objective here?

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.530
Now, let me just go to my online application.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.970
So we have this main page.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.910
Now, my objective is whenever I click on any of this movie titles, I need to be taken to the details

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.270
page.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.550
So what does the detail page look like?

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.100
So it's basically our page right here.

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.930
So we need to be showing the image, some description regarding that movie, which we just selected,

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
and we have the option of booking that movie.

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.310
So this is going to be our details page.

13
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.040
Similarly, when I go to the book button and I select all the items here and then I click on book,

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.620
I need to be taken to the movie booking page.

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.200
So this is going to be a site selection or a booking page.

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.510
Now, again, over here, we're going to be showing the image of the item that was selected, the date

17
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.830
and the time selected as well.

18
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
So after that, you can just go ahead, select the number of seats and then click on the book button

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.440
and the booking should be done.

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.240
So that's our objective.

21
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.400
Now, how do you achieve this objective?

22
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.410
What what is going to be our strategy for that?

23
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
Now, since all these applications are hosted differently, we need a content that's going to be managing

24
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.430
all the separate applications.

25
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.010
Let me just go to the diagram that I've created here.

26
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.170
Now we have this three applications already started the homepage, the details page app and the seat

27
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.860
selection app.

28
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.180
Now, what we're looking to do here is we are going to be creating a new application.

29
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.800
This application is probably going to be called as the, let's say, movie booking application.

30
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.670
So this is going to be managing all the coordination between the different applications.

31
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.230
So let's say, for example, we are on the road called as slash.

32
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.310
So whenever we are on the root road, we need the homepage application to be loaded.

33
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.620
Let me quickly put this at the back.

34
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.520
So we are going to be loading this homepage road or the homepage application policy.

35
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.820
And once we are going to be navigating to a new layout, let's suppose we click on that button and then

36
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.740
we go to the details page.

37
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.660
So that's details.

38
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.420
We are going to be sort of removing this from here and then we are going to be pulling up the next application

39
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.310
and loading it into our main container.

40
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.910
And similar thing is going to be done for the seat selection application.

41
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.950
Now all this is going to be done using a library of React called React Out.

42
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.290
So we have like a common library.

43
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.640
So let me just give it a name as maybe react to.

44
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.680
So this is going to be a library that is going to be used for managing the routing.

45
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.630
So this is going to be sitting at the root level or the base level of that application.

46
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.680
So whenever we switch between the application, the main routing does not change.

47
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.410
It still remains there managing all the routing.

48
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.680
So this is our strategy, how to be implementing it.

49
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.010
So let's go to our code and see how this can be done.

50
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.320
So let me switch to my code base.

51
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.240
And in this code base, you're going to be finding a new folder, and that's going to be the number

52
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.040
one folder called Movie App.

53
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.930
So what do you need to be doing this?

54
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.190
Just copy this movie app folder since it has all the basic rules set up.

55
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.090
And I'm just going to be pasting it into the 11.1 folder.

56
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.700
Let's give this a new name.

57
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.130
Let's just call it movie app instead of the number.

58
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.710
And let's start of this hour as well.

59
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.470
So I'm just opening up a new terminal window and this is going to be our file application, trust me.

60
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.660
And in here, we are going to go to that folder.

61
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.430
So let's say 11.1 movie app.

62
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.330
Let's get the dependencies and start by saying NPM install.

63
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.350
Okay.

64
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.850
So we have a dependencies there.

65
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.600
Let me just clear this off and see and NPM run, serve.

66
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.230
Okay.

67
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.760
So our application starts off.

68
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.170
Please note the port numbers.

69
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.450
We're starting off on port number 9000.

70
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.160
All of my other microphone intents are on board 3000 something and also a swing.

71
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.140
The apples on board Phi Phi.

72
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.740
Phi Phi.

73
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.040
Okay.

74
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.710
So we have this router out, which is the home page load.

75
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.020
Then we have some other outs as well.

76
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.860
So we got like this booking also slash book so we can do this booking application here.

77
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.480
And we also have the details.

78
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.870
So if I just go to the details, we see the details page here.

79
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.740
So in short, we just need to be putting all our components here.

80
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.030
Sounds easy, right?

81
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.710
Well, it is kind of easy.

82
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.910
Only they are going to be few gotchas that we need to be careful when we are using the routing.

83
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.200
Okay.

84
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.500
But Doctor, let me just give you a quick overview of how this application has been set up.

85
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.770
So if I just open I'm doing a movie application, it's pretty much the same as all our other React application.

86
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.330
The only difference is if I go to the CRC folder Open App Dogs instead of having a traditional application

87
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.290
or comprende loaded here we have like this react router dom loaded.

88
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.990
And in this we are basically switching between the roles.

89
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.120
So we have like the details throughout the booking route and the root out setup here.

90
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.180
So our objective is going to be having all those micro fronts load up over here instead of all the static

91
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.210
components that are being loaded, which is these right here.

92
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.350
So we know our objective.

93
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.930
Let's take a short break and start achieving this routing.
