00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome to a brand new section on my girlfriends.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.460
I'm really excited to present this section to you as this is the most at one section in this course.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.050
We are going to be utilizing all the knowledge that we have got so far in the previous sections and

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.390
are going to be applying it to this micro frontend section.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.550
Now what is Micro Frontiers?

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.900
We are going to be covering that soon.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
So if you look at this image, it might give you an idea that we have multiple containers and from these

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.400
containers we are going to be building a single application.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.640
So let's see, what are we going to be covering in this particular section?

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.790
So in this section, we are going to be starting off with the basics of my girlfriend, and I'm going

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170
to be assuming that we have no knowledge or not even have heard the concept of micro frontend.

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380
So what is micro functions?

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.490
Why do we use it?

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.820
How are we going to be using it?

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.800
Then we are also going to be seeing some of the advantages and disadvantages of using this particular

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200
technique of developing your frontend applications.

17
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.460
So once you have done that, then we'll see when to be using the micro frontend.

18
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.860
In which case is my in very beneficial and in most cases you should generally be avoiding it.

19
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.860
So these are the very lessons that we are going to be covering.

20
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.300
But going through this lesson is really important to know why we are implementing this concept.

21
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.820
Okay, so once we know and we are satisfied that okay, this is a very good approach, then we are going

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.380
to be seeing how to be implementing it.

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.330
So there's multiple categories in which I have divided this entire section.

24
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
So first of all, we are going to be seeing how to be connecting the different components.

25
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.320
So we are going to be developing a project all together using this micro frontend concept.

26
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.380
We are going to be seeing how to be connecting those different applications.

27
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.140
Then we'll also see how to be navigating between those applications because navigation is going to get

28
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
a little bit challenging once you go into the micro frontend approach.

29
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.410
Then we are also going to be seeing these stage management.

30
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.610
Now you're not really aware of what a stage management, do not worry about it.

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.590
Now state management is a very common concept if you're using some sort of single page application,

32
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.370
and we're going to be covering state management in this particular section as well.

33
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.420
Okay.

34
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.980
So once that is done, we are also going to be seeing how do we loading one micro frontend into the

35
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.030
other micro frontend.

36
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.790
So this is exactly the power that we are trying to leverage.

37
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.830
And what is the advantages of doing this?

38
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.000
We are going to be seeing shortly.

39
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.070
So once all of that is done, we are also going to be going through the event in concept.

40
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.550
Now even thing is sort of related with this state management.

41
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.860
So we are going to see how it will be publishing events and how to be consuming this events into another

42
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.460
application.

43
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.650
And that's basically how the communication is going to happen between the microphone event.

44
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.980
So this might look very daunting for now.

45
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.440
It might be are overkill and you are not really able to follow along.

46
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.960
So do not really worry about it.

47
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.280
I just given short introduction on this section.

48
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.410
We are going to be going in a lot of depth.

49
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.000
Now please be noted that this is one of the advanced techniques used for developing a website.

50
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.220
And I'm going to be taking it quite slow and going step by step so that you can follow along and really

51
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.930
implemented in your real project.

52
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.940
So with that said, I am really excited to start developing this website using micro frontend.

53
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.790
So let's move forward and see what we are going to be developing.
