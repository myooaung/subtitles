1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,710
Continuing on from the last video, we only got all the dependencies installed via NPM.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,600
Now it's time to actually remove the dependencies from the index start estimate file.

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,980
So for that, I'm just going to be going to the index start estimate.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,730
And from this, I'm going to be removing all the tags that we see here.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,620
So we have the bootstrap dependency query typed.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,990
We have the validate toaster and load hash dependencies removed from our estimate file.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,210
All right, that looks pretty good.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,690
Our steel mill file is now a bit compact, and that's a good thing.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,990
Okay, so with that done, now what we're going to be doing next is we're going to be adding the configurations

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,250
in our Webpack file.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,820
So as usual, we import the path modules.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,240
So in say two particles do require path.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,480
And with that done, we can start exporting the object for configuration.

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,110
So that will be module dart export equals to a new object.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,640
And in here we're going to be adding the basic configuration entry.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,700
And in the entry, we can define the entry file.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,310
So since we have two entries over here, one is going to be for our index page and the second entry

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,110
is going to be for our courses page.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,050
I can actually go ahead and define the two entry files here.

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,840
So what I'll do, I'll create an object here and we are going to be having to place parameters.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,120
The first one is going to be called US Index and the second one is called as quarters.

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,510
Okay.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,090
So we have the two things done now we have to be specifying the part.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,340
So it's going to be dot slash as RC.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,570
And in this we are going to be pointing to our index dodgers.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,340
So it's going to be index start?

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,910
Yes.

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,020
Okay.

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,810
For the second one, it's going to be, again, dark slash SRT.

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,490
But this is in the previous section.

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,340
And in that we have the courses dot.

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,880
Yes.

33
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,260
Just to validate, we can open it up and we have the courses Dodgers right there.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,360
Okay.

35
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,320
So our notify looks good.

36
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,980
The next important parameter is, if you guessed it, it's output.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,170
Okay.

38
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,920
So we define the output.

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,530
And in the output, we need to define the file name.

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,600
So what is going to be the file name?

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Now, if you remember from the last section, the file name is going to be dynamic because we have two

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,010
entry points here.

43
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,070
We cannot be just naming it as Mandelbrot.

44
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,400
Yes.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,800
So in here, we are going to be defining the file name as name dot bundle.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,940
Yes.

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,110
Okay.

48
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,660
Next, we need to be defining the path for the output.

49
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,070
So that will be part.

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,250
And in the part we'll put it as.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,140
But not resolve.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,030
And inhale is here directly.

53
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,780
Nim coma.

54
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,080
And then we see this.

55
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,500
Okay.

56
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm also going to be adding an additional parameter in the output for clean as true.

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,090
Now I'm doing this because I want that the best for the is being cleaned on every single build.

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,620
And this is going to be very important, as in when we start adding more and more configurations to

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,460
all that back file.

60
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:02,880
Okay.

61
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,090
So that's pretty much done, the basic configuration for the event.

62
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,630
But let's try to run this and see on what stage are we currently?

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,390
What are the things that are breaking so we can start fixing all of them now before we start executing

64
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,140
all that back file, although we can do it using the map boxes.

65
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,870
It's better to have the script created in packages.

66
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,600
And so moving to the package georgeson file.

67
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,700
We'll just add the script here.

68
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,370
So I would say dev and in here we'll save a pack and config.

69
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,290
And the configuration is present in the Webpack dart config dart.

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,010
Yes.

71
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:39,820
Okay.

72
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,290
So that looks good.

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,350
Let's try to run our dev script by saying npm.

74
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,340
Run Dev.

75
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,040
Okay.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,400
So that park is initializing our repository for the first time.

77
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,110
So it might take a couple of seconds.

78
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,330
And as you can see, a couple of things have broken.

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,960
So the first thing that we see is the mode option was not set.

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,340
So that's quite easy to fix.

81
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,250
You can just come to a script and say dash dash mode and this can be set as development.

82
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,020
We are missing shortly.

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,120
What is the development and production mode?

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,190
But for now you can just put it as development.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,140
Okay, so that's done.

86
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,320
The next thing is, does it error in resolving the toaster that says no?

87
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,670
Can you guess why this is coming?

88
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,690
Well, this is because we do not have any of the loader setup right now.

89
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,120
We just have the basic configuration done in the back file but does not really know what to be doing

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,370
with the Access Odyssey Assist file.

91
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,040
In fact, now let's take a short break and I, in fact, want you to be setting up the loaders, because

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,440
this is the repetition, what we had done in the loader section trying to get this access and the access

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,420
loader set up in the configuration file.

94
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,340
Now, if you are successful, that's great.

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,610
You can validate it along with what I am going to be doing in the next lecture.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,950
Let's take a short break and continue on.

97
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,110
And I started announcing this Web back file for the.
