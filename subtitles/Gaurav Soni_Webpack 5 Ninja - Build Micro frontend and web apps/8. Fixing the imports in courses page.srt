1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,770
So just going back to how we scored the approach is going to be quite simple.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,630
So we just open up the core, start streaming file.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,560
So in pages we have the course HTML file and I need to be removing all of this dependencies from here.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,150
So let me do one thing.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm just going to be opening it side by side to make the things a bit easier.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,860
So I have the courses gorgias on the left and I have the courses dot on the right.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,410
Okay, let's go ahead and import all the data.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,290
So first of all, we have the course data that can be imported.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,840
So let me just uncomment that.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,940
So we have the course data imported here, then we can also do the import.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,400
So that is import bootstrap from bootstrap.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,640
Then we need to import the typed library.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,500
So basically for reference, I'm using all the guest files that are present right here.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,530
So that's bootstrap then we need equity.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,240
So dollar from.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,360
jQuery.

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,550
Okay.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,340
Then we need the typed.

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,760
So I'll say import typed from typed dodges.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,480
Then we quickly do the other stuff as well.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,920
So we got validate in there.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,470
Then we got toast.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,800
And finally we also need the load library.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,730
So I would say import.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,410
On the score from Lord Ash.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,500
Okay.

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,740
So with that done, I can actually go ahead and remove all the things from my estimate files so we can

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,750
get rid of all those dependencies.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,670
And we also need to be updating the course says dots file.

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,830
So since, you know, estimate of attack plug in is being used and the bundle is automatically going

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,700
to be injected in the HTML, we can actually get rid of this as well.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,500
All right.

33
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,870
Just going back up and seeing what all our diseases inputs required.

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,270
So we need a CSS import for bootstrap and we also need the index nazi SS.

35
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,820
Okay, let's fix that as well quickly.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,280
So I will say import dot, dot slash.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,050
And we have the index start thesis now for bootstrap.

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,720
If you remember from our previous lectures, we have imported bootstrap in this render dot access.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,110
So I'm just going to be importing this file in my code.

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,890
So instead of importing them one by one, so I'll say import dada slash underscore render dot as the

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,660
RSS.

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:28,960
Okay.

43
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,980
So that's great.

44
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,810
We can go ahead and remove both of these dependencies.

45
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,600
Define a dependency is often awesome.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,740
So this is not imported in any other files per say.

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,120
So we need to be importing explicitly.

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,690
So I go to the assets folder thesis and in there I'm just going to be copying this name.

49
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,800
So let's copy that from here and put it right here.

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,330
Okay.

51
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,120
With that done, I can go ahead and move this file as well.

52
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:57,720
Okay.

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,970
So everything looks good.

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,950
My courses estimate and the JavaScript has been updated.

55
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,500
My server is automatically updated as well.

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,910
Let's go back to our browser.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,320
Hit refresh.

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,360
Let's close off this console and we can see that all these tailings are applied as well.

59
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,460
So we have all equals has been rendered here and we do not have any errors as such in the console as

60
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,700
well.

61
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,710
So this project gave us a very good overview of how we are going to be taking a normalized malicious

62
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:28,260
JavaScript file and really converting it to make it and being friendly and Webpack friendly so that

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,360
we can utilize all the features of that back.

64
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,960
Let's take a short break and continue on with some new features of Webpack.
