00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.540
All right.

2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.710
This is going to be a quick video.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.630
In this video, we're going to be making sure that all our movie titles are getting rendered.

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.860
So we already got one of the titles rendered here.

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.990
So let's just go back to our code.

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.280
Let's just open up our home content cards in here.

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
We can see that we are loading all the movies data from our server that's running here and we get the

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.640
response in data.

9
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.710
So the only thing that we need to be doing over here is we're going to be setting up this state.

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.460
Now you can see that we already have the state declared here.

11
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.370
So I'm just going to be seeing all year set movies and then we pass in the data that we're getting from

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.150
our server.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.740
So that's that's pretty much it that we need to be doing for setting this state.

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.370
Now, if you're not really aware about React, do not really worry.

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
This is something to manage and decompress dynamically.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.630
Okay.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.550
So once we have these states selected, we can see that we have another function here called as render

18
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.030
movies.

19
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.660
In this we are loading suspense along with the movie car component.

20
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.770
So in here we're going to be passing in a couple of parameters to make it dynamic.

21
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.220
I've just opened up the movie card dot TSX implementation and you can see that it takes in two properties

22
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.380
to set it dynamically.

23
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.050
One is the title and second is the image you all now to be modifying this.

24
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.850
What we can do is we can just pass in the title and the title is going to be received from the item

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.720
property so we can see item dot name.

26
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.530
So item is basically the individual array items.

27
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.740
So just going back to our browser, if I just check out all the syntax of our area that's being returned.

28
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.570
So if I just open this up, we have the array within that we have the name.

29
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.310
So that is in the name property.

30
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.760
So in here I need to say item name and we also need to passing in the image order.

31
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.940
So the image you are all equals to item dot image.

32
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.650
You are.

33
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.060
Just like that.

34
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.960
Let's give that a serve and let's go back to our browser.

35
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.760
Let's give this a refresh.

36
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.330
And now we can see that all our data is loading.

37
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.890
So that looks pretty good now.

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.020
Just a couple of things to fix all year.

39
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.260
One thing is we do not need this dummy title here anymore.

40
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.190
So let's get rid of that so we can get rid of this div from here.

41
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.040
Now, another advancement that I'd like to do is instead of having this suspense block here and rendering

42
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.370
it every time we go through all the items, I'm just going to be doing it once.

43
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.320
So we have this div in here and within this we are calling this random movie list.

44
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.190
That's the function here.

45
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.480
So what I can do is I can sort of cut this suspense block from here and be a stitch to remove this closing

46
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.430
tag from here, be a stir here as well, and move all this rendered function within this single suspense

47
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.820
block.

48
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.770
So just make sure your syntax is proper.

49
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.230
You have this suspense block starting.

50
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.210
This is the suspense block closing.

51
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.810
And within this, you have the rendered movie list in the.

52
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.980
So that's how you execute the JavaScript function in React.

53
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.590
Okay, let's give that a save.

54
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.690
Let's make sure things are working right in our browser.

55
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.660
I'm going to hit refresh and things are working perfectly.

56
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.610
All right.

57
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.550
That looks pretty good.

58
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.750
Now, the next part is more like an exercise video in which you are going to be sort of replacing this

59
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.760
quick bookings again from a component that we already have created in our React component.

60
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.270
So let's take a short break and see what is this exercise all about.
