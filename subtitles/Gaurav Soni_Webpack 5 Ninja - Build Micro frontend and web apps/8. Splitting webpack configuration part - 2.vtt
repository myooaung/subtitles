00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.730
Continuing on from the last video we got the three files created for the common, the dev and the prod.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.530
And now we need to figure out a way of how to be combining these files so that all the common configuration

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.620
can be injected into the dev or different configurations.

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.830
Now for that, we need to be installing an additional tool.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:26.280
So let me just open up my terminal right here and I'm going to be seeing as npm install save dev and

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.340
this library is called us Webpack.

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.930
Mouch.

8
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.180
So that's what we need.

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.380
Let's install that.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.980
And please note I'm doing all this changes again in the same folder.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.760
9.4.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.150
So if you get stuck, you can just open up the folder and you'll have the final output.

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.540
Okay, now we have the installation done.

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.460
Now what are we going to be doing?

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.510
Is going to be going to our dev config and import the plugin.

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.140
So we'll say coincide equals to required.

17
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.910
That that much.

18
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.110
And in here, we are going to be importing.

19
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.610
We are doing the named import of a function called as much.

20
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.910
Okay.

21
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.470
So we have the function imported.

22
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.860
Now we also need to be importing the configuration itself.

23
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.130
So that means we need to be importing this Webpack common node.js.

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.880
So what I do yet is contact common config equals to require dart slash.

25
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.240
And in this we point to the web back dart common.

26
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.130
We do not really need the dogs because that's automatically appended at the end.

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.330
Okay.

28
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.610
So we have the common config.

29
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.750
We have the merge function.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.630
Now how do we use it?

31
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.010
Well, it's quite straightforward.

32
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.210
In the module dart exports, we are going to be typing in here as much.

33
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.700
And this is going to be a function.

34
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.070
So just like that, let me just move that down.

35
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
And we need to be first passing in the common configuration to this function.

36
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.280
So as a common config, then put up a comma and then we need to be adding the second configuration.

37
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.200
So that is this right here.

38
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.610
So let me just cut that and paste that configuration object within it.

39
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.810
So just make sure you do not have the semicolon at the end so we can remove that and just formatted

40
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.040
and save that file.

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.120
Okay.

42
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.630
So that that's pretty much it actually we can do the same thing in prod.

43
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.120
So I just go to the Webpack prod import modifiers, so you'll see the contrast, then put up the braces

44
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.020
equal to require.

45
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.280
That back march and then we import the function mulch and also import the common configuration.

46
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.130
So I would say common conflict equals to.

47
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.030
Dart slash the back dart.

48
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.340
Common as usual.

49
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.150
We also need to be making the changes in our model, not export.

50
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.020
So I'll move there.

51
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.580
Don't say much.

52
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.600
Make it a function pass in the common config, then a comma.

53
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.620
And then this second configuration object which is related to a parrot.

54
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.820
I just got it.

55
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.070
And then let me just paste it right here.

56
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.270
Okay.

57
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.050
Let me just fix up the formatting a bit and we are sort of done.

58
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.010
Congratulations.

59
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.760
Now let's make sure that things are working as expected.

60
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.390
So just clear off this console and now to run.

61
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.780
Now, if you remember in our package audition, we are having two configurations or two scripts.

62
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.020
We have the dev script and the product script.

63
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.960
So in here I'll say npm, run dev.

64
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.720
So let's see how that works.

65
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.600
Now, as you see, as soon as I ran the script, the analyzer plugin kicked in and it's showing us the

66
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.010
analysis of the bundles.

67
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.770
So I can just go back to our voice code and just to make sure that things are working as expected,

68
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.310
I can open up the dist folder and for example, if I just open up any of the GC files, you can see

69
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.230
that everything is pretty much readable.

70
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.700
You know, you have all these comments.

71
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.550
Then you have like a lot of gold in here, but everything seems sort of readable.

72
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.990
Not, not very well, but it's sort of readable.

73
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.990
So that means it's a development build.

74
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.730
Now, similarly, if I just stopped a server.

75
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.720
Because we have the analyses overrunning.

76
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.070
Now, let me clear that off.

77
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.590
And this time I'm going to say.

78
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.760
And PM run proud.

79
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.630
Okay.

80
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.930
So let's do that.

81
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.820
Right there.

82
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.180
And in this, you can also take a notice of one more thing, this configuration file that gets picked

83
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.440
up.

84
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.590
So we have the Webpack.

85
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.030
Let me just scroll back up.

86
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.560
So we have the Webpack config and that backdoor prodigious.

87
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.040
And also if you notice as soon as I ran that we got the asset folder created and all the files have

88
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.160
been named as well according to the production environment.

89
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.500
And if I just open up any of the JavaScript files now, for example, this index, well you can see

90
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.650
that it's also minified and nothing is actually readable.

91
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.070
So that's about it.

92
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.020
How we are going to be splitting the files between the development and the production environment.

93
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.470
So I hope you found that really useful and exciting.

94
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.930
And you can take this upper level where you can be adding additional configurations to your files so

95
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.610
you can have maybe like additional plugins set up as well, such as the environment plugin that I mentioned

96
00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.910
earlier.

97
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.890
So with this you should be having a very good understanding of the pack, all the major things that

98
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.030
are out there in the pack.

99
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.130
And now you can just go to any of the plugins or any of the loaders and go ahead and implement them

100
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.630
just by looking at the documentation.

101
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.610
And it's not going to be really very hard.

102
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.320
So I'm done with this production section and we're just going to be having a conclusion in the next

103
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.770
video.
