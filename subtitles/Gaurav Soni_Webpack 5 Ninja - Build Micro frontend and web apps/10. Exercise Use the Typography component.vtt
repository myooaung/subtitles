00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.800
This is going to be an exercise we do in sort of optional if you want to do along with me or you can

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.880
just do it on your own to get a practice of how things are connected among each other.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.880
So let me try to explain what is the exercise all about?

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.460
So this is our React component list.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.070
And in this we have one of the components of topography, which is used for showing the title text that's

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.420
right here, which I violated.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.600
Now, what I want you to be doing is if you go back to our quick booking application, we have this

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.440
text displayed here, which has been quoted directly in this component.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:39.090
So if I just go back to the code base and if I just open up my homepage application and in the homepage

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.660
application, if you open up the component, you have this quick booking component.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.230
Now in this quick booking component, you can see on line number 20, we have this header of quick booking

12
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.320
and we have defined some class names here and this class has been defined in this CSS property.

13
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.330
Now, since this is a reusable component and you might be using it in multiple places, this header,

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.850
we want to be importing it from the React Components Library and inject it all here.

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.830
So this is the task.

16
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.730
What do you need to be doing?

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.370
Now, just to give you an head's up of how that component works, I'm just going to be opening up that

18
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.630
React Components folder.

19
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.570
And in this, if I open up the app dot G's in this RC, so we have the app dog.

20
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.020
So I've imported this typography component here and if I go down, you can see the implementation.

21
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.600
So this is the title text implementation.

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.630
So basically we call this component typography.

23
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.370
We pass in two parameters.

24
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.600
The first one is the text.

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.650
What do you want to be doing there?

26
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.470
And second is the type which is of title.

27
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.850
Okay.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.170
So this is the exercise.

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.730
Just to give you another clue.

30
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.010
So first of all, you'll have to go ahead and update your Webpack configuration of your React components

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.910
application, then go ahead and use the dynamic import in the quick booking digest file.

32
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.500
So you can just pause this video here and try to implement it.

33
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.340
All right.

34
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.210
So how did it go?

35
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.170
Were you able to do it?

36
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.370
If not, or if you feel some issues, you can just follow along with me and we're going to be doing

37
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.090
it right away.

38
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.780
All right.

39
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.560
So first of all, what we are going to be doing is we are going to be updating the Webpack configuration

40
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.000
file for React component.

41
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.820
So in here, we just have two things exported for now.

42
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.470
Let me add the third export.

43
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.240
So I say dot slash.

44
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.000
Typography.

45
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.150
And then I'm going to be exporting the component.

46
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.680
So I'm just going to copy this part so that I don't make any mistakes.

47
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.010
Let's start here and update the location.

48
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.320
So in this case, what's the location?

49
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.780
It's in components.

50
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.580
Then we have the topography, so I'll just put that here.

51
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.780
Typography.

52
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.440
And then we have the topography dodgy.

53
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.750
Okay.

54
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.730
So that looks good.

55
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.450
Topography.

56
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.240
Dot gsx.

57
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.530
Let's save this.

58
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.220
All right.

59
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.190
As always, we need to be restarting our react components.

60
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.520
So because we have just updated the Webpack configuration file.

61
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.490
So let me switch over to my react components.

62
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.600
Say control C to start this over start started back off so that our remote entry file gets updated and

63
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.700
picks up this new component that we we're exporting.

64
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.440
Now let's switch back, go to our quick looking start Gsx file.

65
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.410
And this is where we want to be making the changes.

66
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.110
So first of all, I need to be importing that component.

67
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.970
So as usual, since is a dynamic component, you say const typography.

68
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.750
Equals to react dart lazy and in here with bias in a function and say import and in this we need to

69
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.610
be using the application name.

70
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.000
So in this case the application name remains the same since it has the same application from there importing.

71
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.870
So this application name has been defined as component.

72
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.960
And then we put up a slash and then we have exported this complaint with the name of typography, so

73
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.520
I can just copy this from here and pasted in my bookings.

74
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.320
Gsx So that's the important.

75
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.740
Now to be using this, I can just come to my quick booking part right here, put in the suspense block.

76
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.160
The inserts are dynamic component, so I'll say suspense.

77
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.940
And in this I can be loading my new component.

78
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.350
So that's topography.

79
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.740
We need to be passing in the two parameters.

80
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.720
So that is the title.

81
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.810
And the title is as quick booking.

82
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.500
And then we need the second parameter called as type.

83
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.690
Then the type is as.

84
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.280
And the type is title.

85
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.410
Okay, so that looks good.

86
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.820
We also need to be passing in a fallback or here are those things that are going to work.

87
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.780
So I'll just pass default back as null and I can sort of disable this quick booking which we had earlier.

88
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.820
So let's give that a save.

89
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.890
Now, we do not really need to be restarting the server because the configuration was not changed.

90
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.100
So if I just switch back to my browser and let's switch to our application running on both 3000.

91
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.000
That's right here.

92
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.380
Let's give it a refresh.

93
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.020
And things don't work as expected.

94
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.980
Let's try to figure out what's wrong here.

95
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.500
Well, the problem over here is the parameter name is wrong, so it should not be as vital this should

96
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.760
be as text.

97
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.860
So that's the text that we're boxing in.

98
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.540
So let's just see if that once again, let's go back to our browser, hit refresh.

99
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.020
And this time you see that the component is in fact loaded.

100
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.280
So that's awesome.

101
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.680
Now any time anything is done in the component library for this typography, it's going to be automatically

102
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.360
applied on my main application.

103
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.340
So that was an exercise just to relate as how we are importing and exporting dynamic components.

104
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.700
Now let's take a short break and enhance our application even further.
