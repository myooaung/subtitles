WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.840
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.610
In the last couple of video, we got a lot of things configured in the back very quickly since we have

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.200
the knowledge of all the basics.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.670
Now let's try to run our Web backbone and see how things are looking for us.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.230
Now, if I just open up the package or this and you can see that I already have the script added.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.170
So we have the base script as well as this script.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.520
Now we are just going to be running our script and see if things are working expected.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.530
And if not, let's see how we can be fixing it.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.860
So I see we had a NPM run build.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
So let's give that a run and things don't seem to work as expected.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.950
Now the problem seems to be in the index dogs file and specifically is not able to load something.

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.270
So if you see or here, it's really exactly at this point where it's trying to load this browser order.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
Now if you remember, the browser output is basically a react component.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.460
Now React components are generally written in gsx and this is not really understood by the pack.

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.130
So they do not know how to be compiling these files.

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.080
So for that reason, we need to be adding another loader that has debatable loader and we need to be

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.230
adding some special configuration just for React DNS.

18
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.450
So let's see how that can be added.

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.850
Let's go back to our pack configuration file.

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.040
Let me make this smaller so we have space to work with.

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.870
And we need to be going to the module section where we are now loaders.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.450
We already have couple of loaders added here.

23
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.000
And let's add the new loader right here.

24
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.750
Okay.

25
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.430
So what are we trying to test here?

26
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.390
So we are going to be trying to test the Gsx as well as the files.

27
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.840
So let's write the regular expression for that.

28
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:43.830
So in here I can mention it as DOT and then we can say yes or gsx and then hit all the same.

29
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.430
Okay.

30
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.630
So this is the first part where we are testing.

31
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.210
The second part, we need to be specifying all headers, which all places should our loader be trying

32
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.410
to find this particular file.

33
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.770
So that can be added by writing includes.

34
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.480
So I would say includes.

35
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.590
And we all here will say port dot resolve and then we need to be going to the directory name, comma,

36
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.090
SRT.

37
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.430
And this is the folder where we are trying to be searching all this gas and the gsx files.

38
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.590
So basically if we come here, this is our entire field where all our application code lives.

39
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.510
Okay, so that looks good.

40
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.420
Now, we also need to specify another configuration which we don't want our Webpack to be handling,

41
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.280
and that is specifically B Node.js.

42
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.220
Now, if I remember Node.js, we have a lot of JavaScript added, so we need to make sure that our Webpack

43
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.410
does not go and start scanning all those modules.

44
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.680
Right?

45
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.620
So we can just put up or here as excludes, exclude and in here we'll save part dot resolve and it discord

46
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.720
called directory name comma.

47
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.000
And then in here we will say again node underscore modules.

48
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.740
Okay, so that looks good.

49
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.750
Now finally firing the loaders.

50
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.380
Now, instead of adding the array of loaders, we are going to be adding just one single loader and

51
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.690
this loader is going to be in the type object.

52
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.130
Now we are specifying it as an object because there are a lot of configurations that we need to be passing

53
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.570
it internally for it to work.

54
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.440
So first of all, we need to be specifying what loader are we using.

55
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.920
So this loaders called us Babel loader.

56
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.940
And then we need to also pass in some configuration starter options.

57
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.030
And this is again an object.

58
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.000
So we are passing a couple of options to this.

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.730
We will order and within this options we need to be using the property called presets.

60
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.830
So there's presets and this is going to be of and type A2.

61
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.130
Now in this area we need to be passing couple of presets.

62
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.220
So the first preset is going to be of type A-D.

63
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.740
And in this we are going to be seeing at Bible Slash.

64
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.330
Preset Dash and V.

65
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.870
So that's the first preset that we're passing now.

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.970
The second thing that we need to be passing, all we had is an object.

67
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.480
So this is going to be as target.

68
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.960
And in the target we need to be passing in default.

69
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.270
So this might look a little bit confusing, but this is the kind of setup that is required when you're

70
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.860
doing the table loader configuration.

71
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.970
Okay.

72
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.480
So this is our area within which we specified this be able present.

73
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.020
Within that we have another object which is the target default.

74
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.040
Okay.

75
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.240
So after this area, we also need another preset to be added.

76
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.910
And this preset is specifically for React.

77
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:36.460
So we'll say again, that'd be able and then we put up a slash and in here we say type in preset as

78
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.480
a react.

79
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.100
Okay.

80
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.580
So I know this Lauder does not seem very easy to use, but once you have this configuration done, you

81
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.040
do not really need to be making changes again and again.

82
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.310
So just follow along and things should work as expected.

83
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.760
Okay, so this is the baby loader.

84
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.820
Now let's try to hit our pack configuration for another time.

85
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.260
So let me just clear off my console and say NPM, run, build.

86
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.620
Let's give there a second and we see that we have some errors.

87
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.810
So let's try to fix this arrows that we have here.

88
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.770
Let me make this big.

89
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.880
Okay?

90
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.380
So if we try to read our error message, you can see that it's saying that there's error in the configuration

91
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.030
module is a rules of zero.

92
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.500
So that is basically the first rule and obviously it is our base load rule.

93
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.440
Now let's try to debug for then see what's the problem here.

94
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.130
Now in the rules zero they think that it's the unknown property called includes so devalued property

95
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.310
is one of these so instead of includes it should be just include.

96
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.050
So that's the error that I made here.

97
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.470
So this should be as include and this should be as exclude.

98
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.220
So let's try to conclude of this and try to run it once again.

99
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.240
And this time we see that things are working, but we still see an error that is again in this module

100
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.210
build failed and index start.

101
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.730
So let's try to figure out what's the problem here.

102
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.700
Now in here, it says that the preset aeon we target is not a valid top level option.

103
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
So basically it's complaining about this one right here.

104
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.500
So this one should not be target and actually this should be as target.

105
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.600
So, again, my fault.

106
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.580
So let's just save that, clear the console and try to run it once again.

107
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.530
Okay.

108
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.130
So this time the error is quite easy to solve.

109
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.970
So as you can see, you forgot to add the minister.

110
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.800
So this tells you exactly what to be doing.

111
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.190
So if you just see our plugins section, that's right here.

112
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.110
Now in the plugin section, we are needing to add the mini csa's extract plugin.

113
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.230
So again, can just see mini access extract plugin.

114
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.730
And that's pretty much it.

115
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.060
So I can just format my file and try to run it for the third time and hopefully things should work as

116
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.020
expected this time.

117
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.870
And in fact, we do see that we got Diva back as compiled the things properly, successfully.

118
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.820
And if you just explore our dist folder, we can see that all the images have been copied.

119
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.770
Over here we have the index HTML and also the mean dart bundle dodges.

120
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.130
Now this is one final small thing that are led to idea.

121
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.750
That is the optimization as well.

122
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:14.550
So if I just go to the bottom, so just before closing this off and if I just make the smaller we can

123
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.330
just add and enter here and we can add the optimisation section as well.

124
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.130
So I put an optimisation.

125
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.520
And this is going to be of the type object.

126
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.990
And as we learnt we have an inbuilt optimisation that is displayed junk.

127
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.240
So we are going to be using just that.

128
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.480
So this is called as split chunks.

129
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.300
And in help you pass in another object.

130
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.110
And this is going to be taking a property called as chunks.

131
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.510
And or here we specify all.

132
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.800
So that's it.

133
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.080
Now, if I just try to run my build once again.

134
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.600
So let me clear this off and PM brand build.

135
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.600
Okay.

136
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.330
So we have compiled it successfully once again, but this time we see that we have this optimized vendor

137
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.530
bundle, which is pretty good.

138
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.560
Okay, so that looks good.

139
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.620
Let me just clear off the console and this time will be running the appearance of.

140
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.870
So let me put an NPM run serve.

141
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.980
Let's give it a try and see if things are working.

142
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.580
And as we see that, there are a couple of issues in the order of severe conflagration.

143
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.530
So let's quickly fix that as well.

144
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.710
So he's basically saying that you cannot have this properties of unknown property of Bolt is added over

145
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.980
here.

146
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.960
Well, that's because I added it in the wrong place, so it should not be within this static object.

147
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.830
Rather, you should be taking this out and putting it right here.

148
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.360
Okay.

149
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.640
So let me just format that and I do it on my way back deficit once again by saying parents of.

150
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.390
So this time we in fact see that our browser opens up and we have the application running on Port 9000.

151
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:51.390
So congratulations, you have actually built an API React application using the Webpack configurations.

152
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.790
Now there were a couple of issues that we faced and we also saw how to be debugging diva back file and

153
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.040
how to make sure that things work as expected.

154
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.420
Now, if I just click on the sign in button and let's see if our routing is working as well.

155
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.190
So let me just click on sign in.

156
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.780
Okay, so that looks good.

157
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:12.420
If I just click on Sidenote, we can see that we back on the sign in page and this is basically our

158
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.860
application that we had created.

159
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.700
So that's about how you're going to be building that basic React application.

160
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.560
Let's take a short break and let's see what other optimization we can be doing in our React application.
