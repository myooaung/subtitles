00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,110
Hey, guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,940
And in this video, we're going to be really analyzing what's happening in the bundles.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,840
So let's get started with that.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,540
Now, I want you to created a new folder here.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,230
As you can see, it's called an 8.5 course project optimization base.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,870
And this is going to be our starting point for this section.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,960
In case you faced issues with any of the previous videos, you can either go ahead and copy one of those

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,410
folders.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,810
And if you want to get started with me, you can just use this particular folder.

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,420
And this is going to be our starting point.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:28,620
Okay.

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,210
With that said, let's just head over to these folders.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:31,660
Dumbness.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,390
As you can see, I'm already in the 8.5 folder.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,100
I'm one of the quickly installing all my dependencies since it's not there right now.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,090
But darn, I'm also going to be running NPM Branch Dev.

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,480
So let's get our disk folder so that we can analyze it.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,580
Okay.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,500
Our build has ran successfully and if I open up my best folder, I want to be analyzing what's happening

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,770
in the course bundle as well as in my index bundle.

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,220
Let me quickly to make the smaller.

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,910
And if I go to my courses dot g's file.

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,490
So in the pages we have the course says Dot.

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,670
Yes, we had a lot of dependencies imported here.

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,160
So, for example, let's take up the dependency of Lord Ash.

26
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,020
So if I just go to the course bundle and search for Lord Ash, you can see that the Lord Ash dependency

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,300
was imported here and all discord quarters, something related to Lord Ash, which we cannot really

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,750
understand.

29
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,180
But this is the Lord Ash Library getting loaded here.

30
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,330
Okay, similarly, if you want, you can also be finding the other libraries.

31
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,620
So for example, if I search for validate, that should also be there somewhere.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,370
And in fact, you see that know something related to validate is that.

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,570
Okay.

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,660
The problem here is if I go to my index bundle and try to search for Lord Ash here as well, you can

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,140
see that even in my index model, the Lord Ash is getting loaded.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,290
So as you can imagine, if you have a lot of gas fires, the Lord ash dependency is going to be loaded

37
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,190
multiple times and this is not the best way of using the pack.

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,110
And this is what we are going to be actually fixing.

39
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,130
Okay.

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,800
Now, this was just one of the dependency loads, but imagine you have a lot of dependencies in and.

41
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,290
These are just like V6 dependencies.

42
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,810
But lesser you have like 1015.

43
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,810
Then it is going to be really difficult to analyze which are the dependencies getting used in multiple

44
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,170
files.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,540
So right now we just have like courses and index so we can sort of figure out that, okay, these are

46
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,470
the common dependencies, but imagine if you have like a big project, how do you figure out that,

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,650
you know, which are the major dependencies that I should try to minimize all the dependencies that

48
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,610
are getting replicated?

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,850
So for that, the page gives an awesome plug in and we are going to be using that to analyze our base.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,680
So we're going to be installing that.

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,540
Now for that, we are just going to say NPM, install, save dev and the plug in is called us that back.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,260
So there's that back then bundle.

53
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,190
And later.

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,180
All right.

55
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,040
Just make sure you have the spelling right.

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,570
So there's an laser right there.

57
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,160
So let's go ahead and install that and let's see, how can we be using it?

58
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay.

59
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,240
The bundle, the dependency is now installed.

60
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:17,030
Now, as usual, whenever you are using any of the plugin, we need to be going to our that back file.

61
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,270
So going back to have a pack file, let's go ahead and import that first so we can see const, then

62
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,780
we can see we had as bundle analyzer.

63
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,420
Equals to required.

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,030
And there's that bag bundle and laser dart bundle and laser plugin.

65
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,760
So you can either write it in this way, dart bundle and laser plugin, or there's also another way.

66
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,130
So instead of naming it as bundle and laser, what I can do is I can make a named import.

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,500
And we had I can put it as bundle and laser plugin and get rid of this.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,790
Right.

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,010
Yeah.

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,720
Okay.

71
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,560
So we have this dependency importing now let's go ahead and use this plugin now for using the plugin.

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,440
As usual, we go to our plugins section.

73
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,470
So that's right here now to be using the plugin after the copy plugin, I'm just going to be adding

74
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,650
it.

75
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:17,240
So I'll say new bundle analyzer plugin and we just pass in an empty object for now.

76
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,530
Okay.

77
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:23,060
So with that done, I can actually start of my application once again.

78
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,830
So let's see how that works.

79
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,090
So I'm just going to be running again as NPM run dev.

80
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,650
So let's just give it a minute.

81
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,220
All right.

82
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,950
So this time you can see when I ran NPM Run Dev, we did not actually see our web page.

83
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,540
Instead, we saw this stuff looking all we have with a lot of boxes.

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,600
And this is the beauty of using this plugin.

85
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,030
Now, what is it?

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,990
Let's try to really understand what's happening here.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,860
Now on the top, you can see that we have the course dart bundle dogs.

88
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,590
And on the right, we have the index start bundle ideas.

89
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,490
Now, these are the two major bundles that has been created by the Web back file.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,130
Now, within this bundle, what are the dependencies?

91
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,030
Well, that tells us that we have a folder called as node modules.

92
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,300
And within node modules, you have all of this stuff right here.

93
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,380
Now, as you can see or hear directly without a lot of effort, that load is the biggest dependency

94
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,160
that is there here.

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,860
Now, please note that this size that we see over here also represents the size of the bundle.

96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,890
So load is the biggest library that we're using in our entire project and it is also being duplicated

97
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,940
in both places.

98
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,310
Similarly, you can also see that the query is also being used and this is also quite a big bundle.

99
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,320
So we need to be doing something about this as well.

100
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,030
Now I know that you can see that there are a lot of small, small libraries being used over here, like,

101
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,470
for example, flip dodges.

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,230
And this is again used in both places.

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,260
So basically it's being imported by this another library called as properties within which it has a

104
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,520
lot of sub dependencies.

105
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,010
And this is basically how the node modules work in which you have a lot of dependencies and within that

106
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,460
you have like a sub dependencies.

107
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,810
And this is what we need to be optimizing for though.

108
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,100
Okay.

109
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,500
So this is what we are looking at.

110
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,680
And on the right hand side, you can see that we have this source folder.

111
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,700
Within that, we have the vendor dart access.

112
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,660
Now you can also see that the vendor file is being duplicated as well.

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,010
So if you remember, we had imported this vendor file in both of the JavaScript, so both in the courses

114
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,690
and the indexed ideas.

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,030
And that is why this duplication is present.

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:28,960
All right.

117
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,990
So that's about it.

118
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,050
As you can see, this is a very beautiful plugin and it gives you a very high level overview of what

119
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,910
are the things that you need to be optimizing.

120
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
And as in, soon when we are going to be optimizing the things, we are going to be coming back to this

121
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,260
page and see how well we have optimized our application.

122
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,460
Alright, that's about it.

123
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,870
Now we know what to be optimizing.

124
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,530
Let's take a short break and start optimizing the things and make this even better.
