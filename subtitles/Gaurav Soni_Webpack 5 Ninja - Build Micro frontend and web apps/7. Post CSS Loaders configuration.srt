00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,640
In the last couple of videos, we were successfully able to make our pack built for our React application.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,970
Now in this video, I would like to show you one more thing that we can be doing with this CSS.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,820
Now, when we were writing this, he says, and if we're using some sort of new syntax in it.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,390
So if I just take an example here, if I go to the icon slider dot x, we can see that we are using

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,810
some AppKit specific case configurations and this configuration might not really work on every browser.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,630
So in general, you need to be adding some qualifiers and this is used for supporting businesses on

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,560
multiple browsers.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,020
Now you can go ahead and add this manually, but there's a shortcut to do this using the plugins.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,790
So let's see how we can be doing that.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,850
So let me go back to my web back configuration file.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,200
And in this case, we are going to be adding an additional loader, which is going to be helping us

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,100
with this bolivars.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,140
So what are we going to be doing here is we are going to be adding an additional configuration after

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,100
the success loader.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,020
So first, this loader is going to be coming in and then we are going to be using this.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,240
Yes.

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,740
As Loader.

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,300
So let me object here, because we are not just going to be using it plainly.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,210
We need to also pass in some configurations to that loader.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,130
So first of all, we need to define the load name.

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,970
So I would say loader and this loaders called us post C SS Loader.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,260
So that's the name.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,380
Then we need to be passing it in some options.

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,110
So this is again going to be an object within which we have the post thesis options.

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,140
So just make sure you take care of the capitalization.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,590
So it is post thesis in small letters and then we have the option starting with capital.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:37,920
Okay.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,610
But then this.

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,670
We also need to be passing in another parameter.

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,860
So that is the plugins.

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,050
And this is going to be of type added.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,280
Now within the array, we also need to be passing in a list of area.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,310
So this is going to be another area.

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,320
And within this, we pass in the first plugin.

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,660
So the plugin is called us post thesis preset.

36
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,970
There's pre said TNB.

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,930
So that is the name of the plugin that is going to be using.

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,930
And then we just pass in a blank configuration object for this plugin.

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,040
Okay.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,200
So this seems a little bit complicated.

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,660
And just note that there are two things that are being used here.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,070
One is the postseason order and the policy is preset.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,640
And we.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Now both of these things are already been installed in a package or Jason.

45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,480
So if you just come here, search for post C.

46
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,630
So I already had this installed as a dependency.

47
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,910
Now so you do not really need to install it explicitly, but just take a note in case you're using it

48
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,110
on your some personal project.

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,910
Look, let's go back to our PAC config.

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,180
Now, this is all the configuration that we need to be doing.

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,900
Now, we can just copy this entire loader just like that.

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,430
And since we have just added it to our access loader, we also need to be adding it to our access loader.

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,220
That that's right here.

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,790
So we have the Minix extract plugin used, see us as Loader and the SARS as loader.

55
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,070
So I need to be adding it just after the SCA says loader to that right here.

56
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,550
Now just add a comma as well, do the formatting and just make sure that you are following the correct

57
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,940
format.

58
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,530
Those loaders are not going to work.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,670
So what do you need your minix as extract, then this SS loader, then the post the SS and finally the

60
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,780
a SS.

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,520
Well, guess what?

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,070
That looks good.

63
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,030
Let me just go ahead and save this and try to run the configuration.

64
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,400
So I'd say NPM hat on build.

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,770
Let's give that a second.

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,810
And we see that our build was successful.

67
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,580
In case you're facing some failure, just make sure that Austin, Texas got it because the thing can

68
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,600
get tricky at times.

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Just make sure that your spelling is correct and the capitalization is also correct.

70
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,400
Okay.

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,430
With that, then let's explore what happened in our test folder.

72
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,940
So we our test folder already opened up and if I open up main, Garcia says, so this is where all access

73
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,450
is kept.

74
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,430
Now, let me just quickly make this model.

75
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,240
Now, in case of the place folder, as you can see or hear, many things have been replaced and added

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,290
by the plugin.

77
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,810
So in this case it has already added the Polish L5 for example, the zip file mozzarella firefox.

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,360
So this is the policy that was added and a couple of other policies added here as well.

79
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,640
So this is exactly how both cases can definitely help you in speeding up your development.

80
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,780
So you can go ahead and use this in your next project so that you do not really have to write all the

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,540
code for.

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,190
Yes.

83
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:27,970
Okay.

84
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,840
So that's about it.

85
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,370
Let's take a short break and explode the last plugin that we're going to be applying on our React application

86
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,570
that is for easy length.
