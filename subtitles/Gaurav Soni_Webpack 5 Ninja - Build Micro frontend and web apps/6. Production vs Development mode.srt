1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,300
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,170
Guys, welcome back.

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,520
In this video we're going to be seeing, what are the differences between the development and the production

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:05,790
mode?

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,920
In the past couple of sections, we installed a lot of plug ins, we did a lot of configurations.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,320
And in the end, we also saw that some of the configurations were only applicable when we are running

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,490
in production and some of the tools were more helpful when we are doing the development.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,530
So how do we segregate all of this and what are these aggregations that we should be doing?

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,440
Okay, so I've just created a small table here just to analyze what are the differences between the

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,940
development and the production mode.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,490
So for example, in production we will be using plugins such as the modification of DML.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,180
We are going to be implementing tree shaking, copying of the asset to the disk directly so that all

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,630
the references do not break.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,130
We are going to be setting up some variables that might be specific to the production environment,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,980
maybe connecting to our production server and so on.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,890
And finally, we also might be splitting into chunks only when we are in the production mode.

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,730
Okay.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,980
So these are the production specific configurations that we would be following and there are some development

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,760
specific things.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,860
So for example, the Webpack dev saw and this is really helpful when we are doing the development.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,470
So this should only be running when we are in the development mode.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,490
We are also going to be having the dev environment specific variables.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,100
And we are also going to be having like the bundle analyzer, which is also helpful only in the development

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,430
mode.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,330
So these are the development specific configurations.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,730
Now those are going to be some configurations which are going to be shared across both the production

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,870
and the development mode.

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,100
So what are they?

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,840
So we are going to be having things common, such as setting up of the loaders.

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,210
So if you want to be loading the image or thesis, it has to be done in both the base right there you

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,550
are in the production on the development mode.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,710
So this is going to be common.

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,450
We also need to be specifying the entry and output specification.

34
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,890
Again, this is also the common because it's the same application.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,850
They should be having the same entry and output.

36
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,150
Right.

37
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,180
And finally, the DML file creation.

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,480
So this was the ML Webpack plugin specifically, which was helping us to automatically create the estimate

39
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,040
file using the template and so on.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,200
So these are some of the things that are going to be shared across both the production and the development

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,500
mode.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,460
So how do we configure our entire Webpack file?

43
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,920
So for example, if I just switch back to my Vila scored and open up the Webpack config, we can see

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,860
that all the configurations have just been dump here.

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,380
Now I need some way to be basically telling the pack that, hey, if I'm in development mode, just

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,430
run a couple of plugins.

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,240
If I'm in the production mode.

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,760
Run another set of plug ins.

49
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,790
So how can we be doing that kind of configurations?

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,090
So we're going to be seeing how to be configuring this in the next video.
