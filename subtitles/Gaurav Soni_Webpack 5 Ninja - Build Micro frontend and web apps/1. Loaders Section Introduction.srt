00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,010
Welcome to a brand new section on Lord of Lords as one of the fundamental things that you are going

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,650
to be using when you're going to be creating of a back file.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,940
So what exactly is Lords is going to be covered up in the upcoming sections.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,860
But just to give you a heads up on why I've kept a dedicated section for this is because whenever you

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,660
are going to be trying to load different kind of file types, let's say JavaScript images, forms or

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,300
styles, you're going to be using this concept of lords.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,990
You might also need in your future project to be loading maybe a HD HTML file or JSON file and loaders

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,560
is what is going to be helping you with that.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,130
So that's the reason I've kept a dedicated section just for loaders.

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,290
Now, once we have implemented loaders in our web back configuration, we are going to be having an

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,210
output, which is a combination of all this different file types into this single bundle.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,490
So that is the importance of loaders.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,630
So let's just dive in and see how are going to be configuring this loaders.
