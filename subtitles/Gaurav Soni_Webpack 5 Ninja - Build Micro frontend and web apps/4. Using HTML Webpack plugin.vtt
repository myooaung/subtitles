00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.360
Hi.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.020
Welcome back.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.880
And let's continue on with the plug ins.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.810
Now, in the last video, we had created a project in which we had two pages.

5
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.420
We were able to create two entry points.

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.830
So in our config we had two entry points, which was the index and the product page.

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.700
And now let's see how we can be creating the file as well.

8
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.900
Okay.

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.180
So to get started, first of all, we need to be installing the dependencies, known wikis.

10
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.300
I'm just going to be copying the previous folder so that in case you get stuck, you can just come to

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.670
this particular folder and see what's going wrong.

12
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.750
So let me just say Control C and Control Re and I have the copy ready and I'm just going to be doing

13
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.920
some renaming here.

14
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.930
So let's make that a 7.2.

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.710
And instead of multiple entry, I can see each HTML Webpack plugin.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.550
All right, so that looks good.

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.520
You do not need to be really doing that.

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.030
I'm just doing it for my purpose.

19
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.620
Okay, with that done, let's go ahead and install the Steam plugin.

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.750
Now, the concept is very similar to loaders.

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.870
When we had to be using the loaders, we installed them explicitly using NPM, such as the excess loader,

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.310
the style loader and so on.

23
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.460
Now we are going to be doing the same thing for plugins as well.

24
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.260
So just going back to the terminal, let me navigate to the appropriate folders.

25
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.490
So that is 7.2.

26
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
In my case, you can just go ahead and use the previous folder.

27
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.750
Okay.

28
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.460
With that done.

29
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.580
What I'm going to be doing here is I'll see NPM install.

30
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.290
Saved have.

31
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.000
And in this we need the optimal the back plug in.

32
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.970
Okay.

33
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.030
So that is almost going to be getting installed soon.

34
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.990
Okay.

35
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.500
We have the installation done.

36
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.400
Now we need to be importing this plug in in our back file.

37
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.120
So in our backplane, I'm just going to be opening the 7.2.

38
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.440
So let me just go ahead and close all of this and open my 7.2 folder.

39
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
And in the Web config, let me go ahead and import that configuration.

40
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.020
So as a concept, as HTML Webpack.

41
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.980
Plug in.

42
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.080
You can just give any name as you like equals to require.

43
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.810
And in here, we're going to be requiring the pack plug in.

44
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.820
Okay, so that's done.

45
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.760
Now, we have only seen couple of sections how to be adding the entry output and also to be using the

46
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.240
loaders.

47
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.660
Now for using the plugins, you need to be adding a new section as well.

48
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.320
So this section is called, as you guessed, it is called plugins.

49
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.970
So it's called plugins.

50
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.130
And this is going to be of the type added.

51
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.450
So since we can add multiple plugins, so we are going to be declaring it as an added.

52
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.090
And when we want to be using plugins, you need to be initializing it using the new keyword of JavaScript.

53
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.590
So it's a new then we see a HTML Webpack plugin.

54
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.310
And in this we can just posit just like that.

55
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.180
Now the of a plugin also takes in an object.

56
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.280
So you can do additional configurations here.

57
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.650
But let's see what happens if we run this particular application without any configuration.

58
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.850
So I just save this and run, npm, run, build.

59
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.410
Just like that.

60
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.190
And once you have that done, you can see that we did not really get any errors.

61
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.870
And if I go to the dust folder, you can in fact see that a indexed art achievement file has been created.

62
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.620
Now, this is the beautiful part of the email plug in.

63
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.200
It automatically generate HTML file.

64
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.050
Now let's have a look at what is exactly created here.

65
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.050
So let me just quickly format this.

66
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.220
And you can see that it just created a plain SD file, but it really did two things.

67
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.740
It injected both of those dependencies.

68
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.240
So as you can see, we have the index dart bundle Rogers injected as well as the product bundle.

69
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.050
So these were the dependencies that were added in the back file and it was like, okay, let me just

70
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.620
go ahead and create a single file and inject both of the dependencies.

71
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.270
And things should work perfectly fine.

72
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.190
Well, technically, it would work fine if you had your index protected in that all format and everything

73
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.810
was being loaded via JavaScript.

74
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.380
But unfortunately, in our case, that is not how it works.

75
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.120
In our case, we had a lot of estimate markup.

76
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.480
So just going back to our estimate files.

77
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.570
So if I open index start estimate, you can see that we had like this header section, then we had like

78
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.870
a main section and a lot of other demand markup was added both in the index and the product's HTML page.

79
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.650
So what we need to be doing over here is we need to be telling the plugin that, Hey, I already have

80
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.750
a markup and you just need to be using that markup and then adding all the dependencies in that.

81
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.400
So how do we do that?

82
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.710
Well, for that, you just need to come to the configuration object and add a couple of configurations.

83
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.770
So the configuration that we're going to be adding over here is the first one is as template.

84
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.340
So in here, we want to be defining what is the template that is going to be used.

85
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.520
And the second one is called as the chunks.

86
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.710
So in the chunks, we need to be defining what are the dependencies of this particular template.

87
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.430
So for that, let's first of all go to the template.

88
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.910
So we are going to be seeing but not resolve.

89
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.310
And in this we'll call it as directory name and our template exist in the source folder.

90
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.640
So I'll say SIRC.

91
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.580
So let me just pick start as our C and in that we have the index dot as well.

92
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.530
So I'll say index dot as HTML.

93
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.640
All right.

94
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.580
So that is my first template that I need to be using.

95
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.710
And then we need to define the chunks.

96
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.520
The chunks are basically the and defined.

97
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.320
So we need to be telling what are the dependencies.

98
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.260
So you might use the index statistic will depend only on the index entry.

99
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.220
So we can define an array here and we can pass it as index.

100
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.490
Now make sure that this is of type string, not directly referencing the index that we have here.

101
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.490
Now we have done the last thing that we need to be telling is we need to be injecting this dependency

102
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.360
in that template.

103
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.270
So for that we need to say inject and then we can see as true.

104
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.800
Okay, so that's done.

105
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.390
Let's just quickly save this file and try to run the bundle once again.

106
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.100
So I would say NPM, run, build.

107
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.540
So we have the bundle created once again.

108
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.370
Now, if I go to the index statistic, well, you can see that all the markup has been, in fact, additive.

109
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.860
So we have the body section, we have all the other mock ups here.

110
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.300
And the best part is we also have this group tag added right here.

111
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.110
Now, what I can do over here is I can just go to my index, start HTML and we can actually be removing

112
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.030
the script that we started manually.

113
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.420
So I can just remove this from here, remove the same from the product start edge html also.

114
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.450
So I'll just remove that.

115
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.460
And let me just close this estimate files and try to run this bundle once again.

116
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.990
So Van Buren built.

117
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.670
So with that done, let's go and check out our index start table.

118
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.420
And in this, if we check it out or here it highlighted the index that bundled our GS.

119
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.220
So automatically it has added it and this was not added by us in the template.

120
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.710
So a similar thing can be done for the product as well.

121
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.140
So we can just go back to the pack config.

122
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.000
Now you might be thinking how do we add multiple stimuli pack plug in?

123
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.160
Now that is in fact possible.

124
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.500
What do you need to be doing this?

125
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.730
You could just need to be replicating the entire thing.

126
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.640
So you can see again, new HTML Web Pack plugin.

127
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.690
In this we define the new template is going to be as part dot resolve directory name.

128
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.410
And this is going to be sa c slash.

129
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.560
Product, not FDA ML.

130
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.900
Okay, so that's our template.

131
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.450
The second thing is our chunks in the chunk we can specify as what we have here.

132
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.370
So we need to be using this exact name.

133
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.760
So in this case, it's going to be just product.

134
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.330
And finally, we have inject as to.

135
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.740
Awesome.

136
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.400
So that's done as well.

137
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.390
Now, if I could just save this file, try to run my bundle once again.

138
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.770
So I'll say NPM, run, build.

139
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:15.920
And we can see that we have a conflict here, which is in the name of that particular file.

140
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.890
Now this problem's coming basically because it does not really know how to be resolving the file name.

141
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.120
So by default it's going to be giving the filing as index start as HTML.

142
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.460
Now, since we have to plug in so we are of the same type, it does not know what to be giving the name

143
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.300
for the second one.

144
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.920
So for that reason, you need to also be specifying the file name here that needs to be created.

145
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:43.250
So what we can do over here is we can just come here and see file name, and in the file name we can

146
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.320
specify the file that needs to be created.

147
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:52.670
So for example, we can call this as products dot HTML and this one we can be calling it as the index

148
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.480
start HTML.

149
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.430
So I can just give it a file name as well.

150
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.430
Let's call this as index start.

151
00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.560
That's HTML.

152
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.300
Okay, so that's done.

153
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.020
Let's try to save this file once again, clear our console and try to run the build.

154
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.610
Okay.

155
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.690
So as you can see, this time we were successful and we are getting two output bundles.

156
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.510
So we add the index dot HTML as well as the product start SDL.

157
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.930
Now just to make sure things are working fine, instead of opening this index start, I am going to

158
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.600
be using the one that is that in the test folder.

159
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.700
So let's right click on the index, start HTML that was created theory will in finder.

160
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.530
Let's double click the index deductible and something seems to be wrong.

161
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.360
We lost all our thesis.

162
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.030
Now JavaScript still seems to be working.

163
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:44.090
As you can see, I have my list created here and I also have the dropdown in which I can be using the

164
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.230
list formatting.

165
