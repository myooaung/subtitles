1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,780
Things seem to be working pretty well.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,150
We got our application running in the browser, but there's one particular issue that I'd still like

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,600
to fix.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,170
So first, to demonstrate the issue, let me just get myself started.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,660
So I'd say NPM, run, serve.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,470
So let's get that opened up in the browser.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:18,790
Okay.

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,470
So my application now started.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,160
If I click on Sign In, I look at the page by classic example.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,100
I use the browser's back button and the front button.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,980
We can still see things are working, but if I sent a request, you can see that it is not cannot get

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,390
these flash movies.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,340
Similarly, if I go back, you can see on the log in as well and if I just try to click enter as well,

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,060
nothing works.

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,540
Well, what's happening here now to explain what's happening here, we have the event Dev Silver running

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:46,810
right.

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,300
And we also have a React application running.

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,600
Now generally what happens in our client relation is the browser sends the request to our so that I

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,990
want this login page and it returns I will file in return.

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,960
Now in our case we do not have individual achievement files for every note as we had earlier, so the

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,600
dev server does not really know what to be returning back.

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,880
So we need a way in which you can sort of tell that backed up so that here we're using client side routing

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,490
or our routing is basically managed by react application and do not try to basically mess up the data

24
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:18,790
out.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,860
So how do you configure that?

26
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,860
It sounds complicated, but it's quite straightforward.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,060
So let me just go back to the configuration in the dev server.

28
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,700
So this is how our application is being served locally.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,240
So in the dev, so we just need to be adding an additional configuration.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,180
And in here we can see as history.

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,170
EPA.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,790
Fall back.

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,890
As true.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,300
So this is basically the configuration that we need to be adding to the dev.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,920
So let's see if that stop also and try to run the application once again.

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,570
Okay.

37
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,400
So our new application starts off.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,150
Let me sign in.

39
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,650
We have the page added here.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,220
Let me use the browser's back button and just maybe try to enter or maybe like go to the movies it out.

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,950
And we do see that these movies are out as added and we do not really get that cannot get flash movies.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,440
So now we can see that our routing is working pretty well.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,370
We can move between the notes when using the browser's front and the back button.

44
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,610
So that was about a small configuration update in our dev.

45
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,600
So let's take a short break and continue on adding some more configurations.
