00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.560
I'm truly excited to bring a new section to you.

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.330
And in this section we're going to be seeing a couple of more concepts on Webpack before we head over

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.500
to the project section in which you're going to be combining all the things that we've learned so far

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.480
and implement and on the project.

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.480
So let's see what we're going to be covering in this particular section.

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.620
Now, in the section, we're going to be seeing a new concept that is of plugins.

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.370
So what is plugins?

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.560
Why do we need plug ins and how is it going to be helping us in the world?

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.960
We are also going to be seeing how to be creating multiple bundle files.

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.520
So if you know that we have just created a single bundle file, which is the bundle dodges.

11
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.260
Now let's see how we can be creating multiple of this and what's the use of doing such things.

12
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.320
Finally, we are going to be seeing some sort of automations.

13
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.440
So in the automation, we are going to be coding up what are the auto bundling and also how are we using

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.430
the dynamic in books and what are we covering all of this?

15
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.330
And this is going to give you a very deep knowledge on exactly what is the power of that pack and how

16
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.710
do you become of a pack ninja?

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.520
All right.

18
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.870
That's about the introduction on this section.

19
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.800
Let's head over to the next video and start learning something new.
