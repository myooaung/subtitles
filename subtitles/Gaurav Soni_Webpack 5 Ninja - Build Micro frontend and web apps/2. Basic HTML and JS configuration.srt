1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,810
So let's start creating our React application using a custom Webpack build.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,510
So I've already created a project bit.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,950
As you can see, this is the number on button and this is going to be our starting point for building

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,030
this entire section.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,200
So I've also duplicated this folder and this is where I'm going to be doing this setup.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,930
Okay, so I have already navigated within the folder and before I go ahead and do any of the installations,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,260
let me just give you an overview of what's in here and what's not.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,460
Okay.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,180
So within the mean folder, we are going to be finding SRT directory.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,100
We have also the package.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,790
Dear Jason.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,740
Now the package that Jason contains all the dependencies that it's going to be required for the section.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,450
Now I've just done this or that.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,310
We all are on the same module versions.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,120
If we are not, we might be facing some issues when you are building the application.

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,260
Okay.

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,510
With that said, let's go to the SRT folder.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,790
In the SRT, we have a couple of policy.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,590
As of the first one is the asset.

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,880
This contains nothing but just a couple of images that we are using on our website.

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,440
Moving on.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,640
We have the components within which we have some smaller level components like the button.

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,820
Then we have like icons like the input box and so on.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,970
We do not really need to be concerned as what are the components and we can also go to the pages.

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,130
We have two pages.

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,890
One was the login page and second one was the movies page.

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,860
So basically the spaces are using the components internally.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,280
Okay.

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,540
So that was the pages.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,510
And we also have the app Node.js, which also contains the routing logic.

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,430
So as you can see, we have the older setup and it shows what are the components that need to be loaded

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,630
on each of the IT out.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,940
Okay, so that looks good.

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,730
That was an overview of what exactly exist for us.

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,770
Now we need to be building the file that is going to be using to bootstrap this entire application.

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,650
So in React, we are going to be having a index start article and we need a index years.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,470
Now this is going to be also our entry file, as I told you earlier in React or any other single page

38
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:55,980
application.

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,540
This is going to be one entry file.

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,460
So for that, I'm going to be creating index cards within the SRT folder.

41
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,520
So let's right click on SD and see a new file and let's call this as index dot.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,390
That's HTML.

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,930
Okay.

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,930
So I'm just going to be adding some basic HTML here.

45
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,870
We have the head section and the body.

46
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,390
Now we need also element in which our entire React application is going to render.

47
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,570
So for that, I'm going to be creating our development and let's give this an idea of, let's say app.

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,340
Okay, so we have our starting HTML file now.

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,880
We also need another starting GC file so we can again click on source and see a new file.

50
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,400
And let's call this as index start.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,180
Yes.

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,680
Okay.

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,370
So for bootstrapping a reactor application, we need a couple of dependencies.

54
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,400
So we'll say import react from react than we also need the react dom.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,940
So the react dom from React Dom.

56
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,630
And for using the navigation functionality in React.

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,730
We also need the browser out as a browser outlet is basically on top of all the other routing.

58
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,110
So we have this rich component, so it sits on top of this entire thing.

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,170
So we need to be first having the browser outer also imported.

60
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,590
So I would say import then the braces from React Rotterdam.

61
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,170
Dom So this is the library we are using for routing and in here I see browser counter.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,070
Okay, so that's done.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,320
We also need the app Georges to be imported here.

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,170
So that's actually the application which is going to be loaded.

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,390
So we'll say import app from dark slash app.

66
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,820
Okay.

67
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,900
So that looks good.

68
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,160
Now we can start writing our function to bootstrap the React application.

69
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,340
So I'll say react.

70
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,740
Dom Dart render.

71
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,780
And in here we need to be first passing in the element that we would like to render.

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,150
So in our case, we need the browser window.

73
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,600
And within the browser window we are going to be having the app component.

74
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,870
So I can actually be removing that and put it like this.

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,400
Okay.

76
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,970
The second thing that we need to be passing, all we heard is where does this element need to be placed

77
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,050
on the ML file?

78
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,640
So we already have the estimate file ready and we have the app ready.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
So we can just pointed to that.

80
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,540
So I can just put up a comma and say document or get element bitey.

81
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,490
And in this we put the app.

82
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,600
So basically React will go ahead, find this element called app.

83
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,270
And within that, it's going to be putting all this components.

84
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,460
Okay, so that looks good.

85
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,290
I can just go ahead and save this, and that's pretty much it.

86
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,120
That's all the bootstrapping logic we need for bootstrapping a React application.

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,180
Now for the next part, we need to be creating of a backfire because right now nothing is going to work.

88
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,100
As you know, Node.js does not really understand what to be doing with all this importance.

89
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,200
One, so we need to be sort of teaching it using the back file.

90
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,390
So I'm going to be taking a short break here.

91
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,270
And in the next video, we're going to be start creating our back file.
