00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.460
Congratulations on coming so far in this course.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.040
We are going to be starting off a brand new section.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.300
And this is going to be really cool.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.640
You're going to be see how to be optimizing that back even further.

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.250
And this time, we're going to be seeing specific positions that we're going to be doing for the production.

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.510
Now, production is basically where you're going to be deploying it live so that your customers can

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.680
be using your application.

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.370
So what are the things that we're going to be seeing specific to the production build?

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.250
Well, a couple of things that you need to be seeing or hear.

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.830
First of all, we'll see the concept of pre shaking as well, assuming and these are quite interesting

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.570
concepts to again, reduce the size of the build because at the end of the day, we want to be making

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.440
our website faster.

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.740
Right.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.640
Okay.

15
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.850
So the second part is the spreading of this uses do a separate phase as well as removing the dead export.

16
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.840
And this is going to be also very interesting to, again, further reduce your body size.

17
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.690
Finally, we are going to be seeing how can we be splitting the entire Web back on position itself into

18
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.400
environment specific configurations?

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.870
So we are going to be having different things that are going to be running when you are in the development

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.870
environment and when you're going to be building it for production.

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.790
Things are going to be slightly changing here.

22
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.940
So we are going to be seeing all of this in this section.

23
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.230
With that, let's take a short break and let's make our way back to the production grid.
