1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,750
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,920
So were you able to install the festival backpack plugin along with the dev server?

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,870
Well, if you got stuck anywhere.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,590
Let's continue on with this video ante to get those things installed and started.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,750
So I have already created a new folder here so you can see Google's project dev software and this is

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,330
going to be having all the configuration regarding the Def Solar.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,030
So for that, what we are going to be doing next is going to be installing the dependencies first so

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,150
I can see NPM install save dev.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,780
The first one is the Mel left back plugin.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,670
And the second one is the Webpack dev server.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,130
Okay.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,710
So both of this dependencies are going to be installed and we can go to the package, Jason, and add

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,990
a new script to start of our dev server.

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:55,200
So I can add it right here, call this as server and in here we'll see that back serve the configuration

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,310
of the web back file.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:06,500
And there's that back door config that yes, the mode is going to be development as usual and we have

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,620
the open flag for opening up the browser.

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,670
Okay.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,010
So that's pretty standard.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,850
We saw that earlier as well.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,440
Now we can disclose of this package addition as we have done all the configurations required.

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:26,470
Next thing we can do here is at the dev server side, see dev server and this is going to be an object.

23
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,780
The thing we need to be specifying is the port so I can define the static parameter and that is going

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,550
to be in the disk folder.

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,070
Okay.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,790
So we have set up the dev server, but we need to be also adding the ML file.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,050
So as you see right now, we do not have the original file and the dev, so is not going to be running

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,070
as expected.

29
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,220
So for that, we need to be having the plug in section also.

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,490
So after the modules are before wherever you like, you can just have in a plug in section and this

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,170
is going to be of type added.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,590
And in this we define our plugins.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,820
So I would say new HTML web back plugin.

34
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,400
And in here we are going to be specifying our options.

35
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,810
Now, before that, let me just make sure that we have the file imported the library important.

36
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,610
So it's a cost estimate Webpack plugin equals to required.

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,310
And this is the HTML plugin.

38
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,170
Okay.

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,010
So we have the plug in right here.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
Now we need to be doing the configurations template.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,060
So that's the first configuration defining where is going to be the template for this.

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,170
So the two files that we need to be solving are the index stardust HTML.

43
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,330
That is right here.

44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,620
And the second one is this go start item.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,560
So what we'll do is a dart slash as I see index dart html.

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,770
And we also need to define the chunks which are going to be loaded when we load this file.

47
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,950
So the chunks in this case is going to be this entry file right here, which is the index.

48
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,770
So let me just probably minimize this little bit.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,490
And if you go down, we can point to that junk.

50
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,140
So that's the index junk.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,470
The second thing we need to be adding for the course file so we can just copy this plugin and add a

52
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,220
new one right here.

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:22,410
And instead of the index, we can just go to the pages and in here we can see courses dart edge HTML.

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,830
So let me just verify the file and yes, it has courses dart HTML and the chunks is going to be updated

55
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,130
as well.

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,370
So this is not the entry file we need for that demon.

57
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,060
It is this one.

58
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,940
So you just copy that and be straight here.

59
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,010
Now, please notice one more thing.

60
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,620
Let's suppose you want multiple chunks to be loaded.

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,730
So let's say, for example, there are two entry files for a single file.

62
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,980
Generally won't do that, but for some reason let's suppose there is some particular file.

63
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,370
You can also add dart here.

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,450
So let's suppose it was dependent on index as well as courses.

65
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,730
They could just add courses here as well.

66
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,520
So in our application we do not need it.

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,110
So I'll just keep it as index.

68
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,460
Okay.

69
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,040
The last thing that we need to fix all your ready file.

70
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,280
Now, we had already encountered this error earlier.

71
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,350
Since we have two times the estimate of a pack plugin, it's going to give us an error that it cannot

72
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,360
be keeping the file name as theme.

73
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,010
So for that, we need to be also giving our, I would say, file name.

74
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,040
Let's call this as the index start adjustment.

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,980
And this file name can be called as.

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,170
The courses that each team will.

77
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,730
Perfect.

78
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,700
So that looks pretty good.

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,360
Now, what I can do or here is try to run this build.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,440
So I'll say npm.

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Run, Dev.

82
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,430
And let's see if the belt works properly first.

83
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,580
Now we can see that a couple of errors.

84
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,150
Let's try to quickly fix this.

85
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,700
So the error here is we forgot to put a comma.

86
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,190
So we need to come after the parameters.

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:00,290
Now, if I just save that and try to run the command once again and we see that we have a new error,

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,670
so let's just quickly fix the errors one by one.

89
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,830
So it says invalid configuration object that has been initialized does not match this schema.

90
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,560
And I've seen that delay issue in the plug ins.

91
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,170
Now, I am not really editing this because I want you to see how I figured out the errors and how I

92
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,680
fix them.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,110
So this might prove to be helpful in your case as well.

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,990
So I'll just scroll to the plugins section.

95
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,090
So this is all plug ins and the problem Toyota's it says the unknown property plug in.

96
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,390
Well, that's because plug in is not the property, it is plug ins.

97
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,450
And that's defined by the idea parsing multiple plug ins.

98
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,860
So let's save that the console and I do run it the third time.

99
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,710
So this time the error is with the communicating.

100
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,140
So if I just called to the top, let's try to fix that as well.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,180
And fingers crossed, hopefully things work out this time and it's taking some time.

102
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,620
So I'm really hoping this should work properly and we in fact see that it was successful.

103
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,540
So after a lot of trial and error, we was successfully able to create the Webpack file.

104
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,100
All right, great.

105
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,790
That's good.

106
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,460
Now, we also have to make sure that the things are working.

107
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,630
If I go to the test folder, I, in fact see that the two SDL files are present here.

108
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,470
So let's give it a try and run our dev several thousand pm.

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,640
Run.

110
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,870
Serve.

111
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,230
Okay.

112
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,130
Diva pack def.

113
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,240
So we're starting off.

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,180
It opens up the browser aspect of our configurations.

115
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,490
So running on localhost, AT&amp;T and voila, we see our page here.

116
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,760
Now there are a couple of issues here which I can notice immediately.

117
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,050
One is the banner image is missing and let's see if our routing is working as well.

118
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,360
And we see that our routing is breaking as well.

119
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,790
So why are things not working here?

120
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,790
Well, let's figure that out in the next video.
