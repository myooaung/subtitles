00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,450
This is a very important video, and please do not skip this.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,410
You're going to be needing this project structure for following along in many of these actions.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,280
Now already uploaded the entire project structure on my GitHub account.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,860
So you just can come to this GitHub account called got only one slash about back to me and you're going

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,530
to be finding the entire project source code over here.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,470
Now to be using this, you can just come to this code and say download zip.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,760
Now this is going to be downloading the entire source code on your local and it is also going to be

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
the starting point for many of these actions.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,920
So let's just give that a second while it downloads.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,030
Okay.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,920
So once you have that, download it up so I can just shorten finder extract this folder here.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,210
And you can just open up this folder and you're going to be finding the entire source code for all the

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,520
sections that we're going to be covering in this entire course.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,530
So in many of these sections, you are going to be hearing me say that this is going to be our base

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,600
for starting off this section, and you need to be basically using this folder for doing the development.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,630
Similarly, you can see that I have a couple of base folders here.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,880
So for example, I have this project base.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,910
Then we also have this production build base and so on.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,680
So we can either do the development within the same folder, or you can just clone this and create a

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,760
new folder for yourself.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,610
Now you can also see that I have some additional folder here.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,890
So in case you get stuck in any of the places.

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,230
So for example, you get stuck in this place called as split cases, one of the lectures in the course.

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,730
So you can just go inside this and compare the source code along with what source code you have written.

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,970
And this can help you in debugging if something is not working as expected.

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,140
Okay.

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,870
So just make sure that you had this folder structure downloaded.

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,470
So whenever you want to be doing some development, you can just open up your best code.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,240
So for example, I have my voice code already open here and you can just drag and drop this entire folder,

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,260
for example, right here.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,660
And then you can start doing your development.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,550
Now, just to give you an overview, you can start your terminal in voice by going to this dominant

33
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,740
command on top and saying New terminal.

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,990
So this is going to be opening up your terminal.

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,710
In this, you are going to be writing all the commands for executing your other pack configurations.

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,630
So that is about it.

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,660
A quick overview.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,590
So just make sure that you have this project repository downloaded.
