00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,190
We are finally at the end of our course.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,740
I hope you have learned a lot from this about and you are very comfortable using it in your next project.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,800
So we have covered a lot of things in this entire course.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,020
We started off from right from the basics in which we had no idea of what exactly is Webpack and ought

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,220
to be doing the configurations.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,590
And we have finally, in the end, seen how to be using multiple applications, running Webpack and

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,520
combining all of them into a single application using micro frontend.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,170
So this was a very good overview of the pack and how to be using it in your next project.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,970
I'm going to be keeping the schools up to date as and when new versions of the pack is released.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,710
So do keep subscribed to discourse.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,020
And last but not least, if you are not given a review for this course, I would really, really appreciate

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,780
if you can give me a review of this course.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,290
This is going to help me keep motivated and help improve on making this course even better.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,670
So that's it for now.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,990
That's me signing off.
