00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,240
We are finally at the end of our micro Franklyn section.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,860
I hope you learned a lot from the section and we have gone through a lot of things over here.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,970
So let's recap on what are the concepts that we get covered in this section.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,640
So first of all, we had seen how do we creating multiple applications and how do we connecting those

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,720
applications together?

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,910
Now we connected the applications using the module federation plugin that has been provided by Webpack.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,340
We saw the concept of exposes and how do we using the remote in the consumer applications.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,610
Now we also saw how do we creating those applications?

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,760
So we had this homepage application and we also created a container application which was hosting all

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,440
the other micro frontend applications.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,660
We now also know what the application of that mean container application that we created.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,810
It is helping us in two core concepts, is helping us to do the routing of an entire application as

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,780
well as to do this data management using our ideas.

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,750
We also use the concept of dynamic import that was implemented when we wanted to be calling some Brexiteers

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,560
functions and also saw how do we loading the components dynamically.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,200
So for example, in the homepage, people using this React component application running on a separate

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,050
port and loading it in the homepage application.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,460
We were also doing things such as biasing the data on another page.

19
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,190
So we saw to be passing the data using the path barometer as well as how do we passing the data using

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,090
our next year.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,340
And finally, we were able to click on the book Now button, getting all the data that is required for

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,020
doing the booking on our final seat selection application, and then we are able to book the movie.

23
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,110
So this was one of the advance section of how to be using the module for duration of Webpack and how

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,150
do we building really complex applications.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,570
I hope you really enjoyed this and learned a lot from this section.

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,870
Now, as a quick reminder, if you are really stuck in any of those places, you have this final folder,

27
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,420
11.3, which is going to be containing the latest code for running the entire application end to end

28
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,110
and with all the connections and all the text is already set up.

29
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,420
So in case you are facing any errors in some particular applications, what you can do is you can just

30
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,550
copy the entire folder and replace it in your application and things should work as expected.

31
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,400
You can also replace the entire folder if you require to.

32
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,640
So that's about it for micro front end.
