00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.260
In this video, you're just going to get the book button working on the movie details page.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.550
So we've already seen how to be doing the navigation, how to be prancing around the state.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.300
And this video is just going to be combining all of that in this single video.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.940
So let's get these things implemented.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.350
I'm just going to be switching back to my voice code and let's just go to our details page.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.210
So that's an idea.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.620
And for the state, I need to be making sure that you have the remote set up.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.140
So let me just check out my remote.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.000
So we do not have a remote right now.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
So we can just set up one, see a remote, browse in an object.

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.570
And this is the movie app, and we need to be getting the location of the movie app.

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.450
So for simplicity and in case of avoiding errors, I'm just going to be copying it from the home page

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.720
app.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.670
So we just open the configurations, copy the entire thing from here.

15
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.560
So this is our movie application.

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.020
Actually, I'll be copying the entire movie app.

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.030
Okay, so that's done.

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.220
Let's copy and paste it here.

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.650
Okay, so we have the remote set up.

20
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
So I can just save this file and and stop and again, start off my application.

21
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.790
So let me just quickly find that app.

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.630
So once you have a lot of app, it can be a little bit difficult to find it.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.110
Okay, let's stop this over and let's start that off once again.

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
And parents solve let's just give that a second.

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.590
And we have the details page running.

26
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.360
Okay, so that looks good.

27
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.010
Let's come back to voice code.

28
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.490
And now we need to be using that observable over here.

29
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.230
So if I just open up the as I see in the components, we have the details content.

30
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.030
And this is where we need to be publishing or are pushing the data to that observable.

31
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
So if I just go down and see what is the function getting called on the book now button.

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.170
So we have this book now button and on this, this book movie function is getting called.

33
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.050
So let's go to the book movie function.

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.310
So that's right here.

35
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.650
We already have the booking object prepared for us.

36
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.870
We just need to passing it.

37
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.200
So, as usual, we need to be using the dynamic import.

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.450
So I'll say import and then we need to be passing in the import statement.

39
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.810
Now, the import statement, as usual, is going to be the app name.

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.390
So in this case, the app name is movie app.

41
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.070
So let's be a start here.

42
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.890
And then we need to be passing the component name, which can be found in the movie application.

43
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.570
So just check out the Webpack config so that the component name.

44
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.780
Let's come back to our digital content and being strategic.

45
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.990
Okay.

46
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.270
Then we use Dart, then then we get a module as a parameter and then we have the movies data.

47
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.050
So we can see concert movie data equals to module dart default.

48
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.070
This is not really the movie data, it's more the observable object.

49
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.930
So you can just rename that if you like to, but I prefer to just call it the movie data because it

50
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.240
contains the observable for the movie data.

51
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.950
Now Hannibal, you can just see that movie data dart next.

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.490
And in here we just pass in the booking object so we can see booking just like that.

53
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.920
Okay, so that part is done.

54
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.340
Now, you might notice that there's one thing missing over here when we are clicking on the button.

55
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.520
So if I just click here, the navigation is not working.

56
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.250
So we also need to be implementing the navigation here.

57
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.860
So for implementing the navigation, if you remember, we need to be passing that entire history object

58
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.910
from a movie application to this detailed content application.

59
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.480
Now, if I just go back to our movie application to let me minimize the things not being used and come

60
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.060
to this app in the movie app.

61
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.570
And if you check out the details page, right now we're just publishing the location and we are interested

62
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.690
in the history object.

63
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.590
So that's right here.

64
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.660
Similar to the homepage, this history object is going to be used when we want to be pushing the new

65
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.980
it out.

66
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.420
So what I can do is I can actually be copying this entire parameter.

67
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.540
So you can just copy this from your routing.

68
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.140
And I'm going to be passing this attribute here as well.

69
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.000
So we are sort of passing duplicate location, which is not really necessary.

70
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.060
So this can be optimized when you're creating our own application.

71
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.060
But for now, I'm just going to be keeping this as it is.

72
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.860
So let's just save that.

73
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.730
Now, if I just come to my details page, which is our details content basically, and in the properties

74
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.720
over here.

75
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.330
We should be having the new property which we just passed in, which is the routing attribute so that

76
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.910
as you can see, your routing goes to these two objects.

77
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.610
So we should have like proper start routing.

78
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.060
Now what I can do over here is I can just come to my book movie function that's right here.

79
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.350
And what we'll do over here is once the data has been published in the movie data dot next that we are

80
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.740
passing the data to the observer.

81
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.950
I'm also going to be doing the navigation so as a props dot history.

82
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.130
Dot push.

83
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.220
And in this I'll be pushing the book wrote.

84
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.500
So this is the booking odyssey booking application.

85
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.220
So cross fingers.

86
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.640
Things should work as expected.

87
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.540
Let's just save this and let's just go back to our browser and I'm going to be going to the main application.

88
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.290
Let's close this off.

89
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.180
Actually, we already have the main application here.

90
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.500
I'm going to the main application here on the homepage.

91
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.550
Let's click on one of the titles of example as Doctor Strange, select some data, select some time,

92
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.110
and then let's click on book now and thing did not really work as expected.

93
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.180
Let me just see what I've done wrong so it's this cannot read property of undefined reading push so

94
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.990
let me just go back and this is the problem I didn't say probe start routing so as you remember we have

95
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.490
passed the attribute card routing.

96
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.170
So we need to say probes dart routing, dart history.

97
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.540
So that should now fix that.

98
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.080
So let's go back, let's go to our homepage here.

99
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.340
So let me navigate back this click on Doctor Strange once again.

100
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.050
And then if I just change something here, change the time and click on book.

101
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.360
Now, it still does not really work.

102
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.720
So if I just come on top and if you just check out what's the problem here?

103
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.470
It doesn't really understand what is the note.

104
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.980
And if I just check out my address bar, you can see that it actually did push the book out, but it

105
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.690
pushed it after the speed test page.

106
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.880
We do not need it after it does it?

107
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.440
It needs to basically replace it.

108
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.150
And I have it right here.

109
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.590
So it should be something like this.

110
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.260
So how do we fix that now?

111
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.100
I'm just keeping all this arrows in mind because these are some of the common errors that you will be

112
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.440
encountering when you have your application running.

113
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.930
So I'm not editing out all those errors and we are going to be fixing that along with the video.

114
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.030
So let's just go back to obvious code.

115
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.060
And the problem here is the way we are pushing it out.

116
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.940
So when we passed it out directly, it's just going to be appending to the last road that was already

117
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.610
in the browser.

118
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.360
So this is what we need to be seeing is instead of just book with this slash book.

119
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.980
So we are saying on the route we need to be passing this entire location.

120
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:08.870
So now if I just click on Save and now if I just try to go back for the third time and if you just check

121
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:15.290
out a new maybe this time maybe behind man and let's just same day time so it-bpm and C book we are

122
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.020
in fact read out it to our third booking application.

123
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.480
We see the title Ironman, you see the date, you see the time that we are selected along with the image

124
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.340
and things are working really well.

125
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.930
And you can also obviously just go ahead and select the movie and you get the movie booked.

126
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.760
Now this is how our entire application is working in a micro front approach.

127
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.950
I hope you're really excited to see what are the things you can do with micro frontend and this is going

128
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.240
to be a really great learning and implementation if you're working on a really big project.

129
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.910
So that's about it for micro Frontend, I'm just going to be taking the next video in which you are

130
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.410
just going to be concluding all of the things and see on a high level what all the things we have learned

131
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.850
in the micro frontend section.
