00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,640
Welcome to the implementation video on routing.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,370
So we have already created this application called as the movie application, which is going to be obvious

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,460
application and it's going to be containing all the other applications.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,830
I also mentioned earlier that we are going to be utilizing library called as the reactor outer dome.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,740
And this is going to be helping us to do the navigation.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,210
Now, on a high level, what happens on the movie application is we are going to be having this reactor

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,780
outer dome setting or here, which controls the navigation.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,040
And using this, we are going to be loading the appropriate application into the container.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,900
So for example, on the default out, we are going to be loading the home page application.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,720
So the home page application looks something like this.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:40,920
All right.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,030
So what happens when we click on any of the items on the homepage application?

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,920
So for example, we have this movie card here.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,500
So when you click on any of the items, we are going to be getting an event, right?

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,080
So whenever you click on a on element, you get the event fired.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,860
Now this event is not going to be handled directly by this homepage application.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,040
Rather, we are going to be passing that event to our movie application because all the routing logic

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,750
is contained in this movie application and not directly in this homepage application.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,080
So for that reason, we need to be sort of passing this callback to our movie application, and then

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,720
the movie application is going to be calling one of the APIs of this recruiter DOM History API, and

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,630
then it's going to be pushing the new application in this container.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,140
So for example, when you click on this, we need to be going to the details bit.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,940
So it's going to be basically removing this home page application from the rendering container and plug

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,490
in this details page application right here.

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,370
So that's on a high level what's going to happen and how this communication channel is going to set

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,550
up.

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,920
Now, this is what we are trying to implement.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,980
So let's go to a code and see how this looks on the code.

29
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,030
Okay.

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,830
So I'm back in my code base and you can see I already have all my applications already running.

31
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,180
Make sure that you have all your applications on so that, you know, we do not face any issues.

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,940
And let's start of making some changes.

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,610
So first of all, we need to be sort of exporting our entire page so that it can be used by this movie

34
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,330
application.

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,640
So for that, I need to be going to the pages.

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,180
So, for example, we can go to the home page application.

37
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,540
And if you open this source folder and if you open up the components, we can see that we have like

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,170
two components.

39
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,620
We got like the home page component and we have this quick booking component.

40
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,250
Now, just to give you a visual perspective, let me just open up my browser.

41
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,980
And in this we have this quick booking a component, and then we have this home page component that

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,940
is the entire page.

43
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,640
So if I just go back to the code and if I go to the App Store, this you can see that, you know, this

44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,670
homepage is the main component that's being used.

45
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,020
And within home page, we have the other conference, the quick booking conference that we saw on top.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,100
So in short, we need to sort of expose this enter home content.

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,900
And this is going to be the entire page that needs to be loaded as the default route.

48
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,040
All right.

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,260
So what we are going to do next is, as usual, so whenever we want to be exposing something to an extended

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,340
application, what do we do?

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,630
Well, that's right.

52
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,360
We go to our Web back config and start exposing things.

53
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,620
Now, this is going to be interesting case.

54
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,310
You can see that already there's a remote set up and we are also going to be setting up an exposes.

55
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,530
So a program can have both the properties can also have some remote entry files as well.

56
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,060
It can expose some components.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,880
So that's the power of this module federation plug in.

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,370
So let me just put up the new property here.

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,390
Let's call this as exposes and let's set up the object.

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,140
Now, as usual, we need to passing our string as the key.

61
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,290
So that's going to be, let's say, home page.

62
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,650
And then we need to set up the road that is going to be slash SIRC slash component.

63
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,620
Slash home content.

64
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,210
Slash home content, tart sex.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,790
Okay, so just make sure that your part is correct.

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,830
If this is not right, it's not going to really work.

67
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,750
Now, since we have made some changes in the back file, we need to be restarting also.

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,290
So let me just go to my homepage application server.

69
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,910
So that's right here.

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,800
Let's switch start off by saying Control Z and try to start that off again.

71
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,720
So NPM run.

72
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,220
So.

73
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,580
Okay.

74
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,290
So we have our applications starting off and we see the same output as before.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,980
I'm just going to be closing of all the other tabs so that we don't get confused.

76
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,250
So close other tabs.

77
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,100
And that's looking good.

78
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,290
Okay.

79
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,310
Let's go back to our code.

80
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,380
So the component is now exposed.

81
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,160
Now, to use this component, we need to be going to our main application.

82
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,750
So that is the movie app.

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,020
And in the movie app, we also need to be importing it.

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,150
So if I do go to the web back config, so we do not have any configuration yet set up for the module

85
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,620
preparation.

86
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,800
So let's go ahead and do that.

87
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,160
So as a concept, curly braces equals to require the PAC dot container.

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,720
And in here I say module federation, plug in.

89
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:01,890
Okay.

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,830
And if you just go to our plugins section.

91
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,240
So that's right here.

92
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,590
So I'd say new.

93
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,060
Module Federation plug in and pass in an empty object.

94
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,400
Now, in this empty object, I need to be first giving the name of this application so that can be as

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,890
let's suppose movie app.

96
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:28,440
And then we can put up the file name as a remote entry dot gs and then we need to be setting up the

97
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,970
main thing that is the remote.

98
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,130
So I set up the remote and what are the remotes that we need to be promoting the homepage?

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,020
So let's call this as.

100
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,750
Home page.

101
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,350
And in here we need to be putting up the application name of the homepage.

102
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,090
So that is as well.

103
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,110
So that's right here and we need to be seeing where it is hosted.

104
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:55,310
So that's one step, that's SDP double call and slash slash local host.

105
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,220
And then we need to be putting up the port number.

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,660
So the port number is 3000 of the home page application.

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,430
So that can be added here.

108
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,820
Then we see remote entry dot.

109
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,600
Geez.

110
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,740
Now just make sure that the remote entry file convention is followed.

111
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,280
Exactly.

112
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,230
So for example, we have the entries capital and we here also is capital city.

113
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,060
So just make sure that it is the same.

114
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,620
Okay.

115
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,490
So that's done.

116
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,570
We can just save this file and get our movie application reloaded as well.

117
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,580
So that's my movie application right here.

118
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,550
Stopping this hour and starting that off once again.

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,480
All right.

120
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,950
So we have our movie application set up and this is the route out.

121
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,950
So you can see the homepage and this is where we need to be rendering this entire page.

122
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,410
So let's go back to our code and we are going to be going to our movie application.

123
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,440
So let me minimize the things that are not being used and let's open up our easy in movie app.

124
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,440
In this, we open up the app dogs and we need to be replacing this right here.

125
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,470
So in here we need to be putting our dynamic component.

126
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,080
So as usual, how do we load a dynamic component values to react or lazy for it?

127
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,580
So I would say concept.

128
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,360
Homepage.

129
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,430
Equals to.

130
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,420
React.

131
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,550
Not lazy.

132
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,160
And in here we are going to be saying import.

133
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,250
And then we need to be specifying the application name.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
Now, if you remember what is going to be our application name, it's the name that we set up in the

135
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,980
movie application and through which we are importing it for that homepage.

136
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,740
So we need to be thing homepage or here.

137
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,280
And then we put up a slash and then we need to specify the module name so module name can be found out

138
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,420
from video importing it.

139
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,930
So that's in the home page Webpack config and or here it says that the exposed property is this so we

140
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,670
need to just copy of this home page.

141
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,270
Exactly.

142
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,070
And have that pasted here.

143
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,120
Okay.

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,640
So once you have that done, you should have the homepage component ready for usage so we can actually

145
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,300
be removing all of this and instead of this and what are we putting up?

146
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,500
A suspense block?

147
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,700
So this is suspense.

148
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,900
And in this I'll render the homepage just like that.

149
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,130
Okay.

150
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,150
As usual, we also need a fallback position that's required parameter.

151
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,960
So I'll just put up nail file back here as usual.

152
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,270
And we are actually pretty much done.

153
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,030
So let's check out if our application is working as expected.

154
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,510
So let me go back to my Chrome year refresh and if I just try to see what's wrong, we do not really
