1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,540
Here, guys.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,170
Welcome back to another video.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,830
So in this video, we are going to be seeing how to be loading images.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,050
Now, earlier, when do we want to be adding some load as we used to go to NPM repository and install

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,460
the specific loaders for it.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,430
So we install the style and see us as loaders for loading the cases and also additional loader for the

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,210
SS.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,220
Now there are a couple of built in loaders and Webpack vite knows exactly how to be dealing with those

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,670
files.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,500
So let's see how those work.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,170
Now I'm going to be copying and pasting this folder here, but if you want you can be continuing on

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,250
with the previous folder.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm just keeping it so that things are organized and in case you are stuck, you can just go to my GitHub

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,660
repository and use the particular folders.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,410
So let me just copy that and pasted right here.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,660
Okay.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,410
So that's done.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,200
Let me rename this to five and let's call this as image loaders.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,550
All right, so that's done.

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,090
Let's open that up and we have all the configuration already done.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,950
Now, what we're going to be doing is let's go ahead and open up logo.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,960
So we're going to be downloading image file.

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,110
So maybe the image file can be of the back itself or probably of a PAC logo.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,520
Let's quickly search for that and download any image that you like.

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,380
So for example, I'm going to be downloading this image on my desktop.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,240
Let's call that as Webpack underscore logo.

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,250
Okay, so that's done.

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,480
If I come back to my discord, I can be importing that file here.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,460
So let's go to my finder.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,300
I'm going to the desktop and let's pull that right here.

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,120
Okay.

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,520
So we have the Rat Pack logo imported here.

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,220
I'm going to be moving this into my SRT.

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,290
Let's go ahead and create a new folder here.

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,390
That's called this as a said.

36
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,320
And let's move this BND file here, and that's pretty good.

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,850
All right, so we have a new asset added to our ASIC folder.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,350
Now to be using this asset.

39
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,340
So what I'll do is I'll go to my index, start HTML and in this I'm going to be adding a new section

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,610
within which I'm going to be adding that image that we just downloaded.

41
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,490
So let's put the image probably right here.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,610
I'm going to be adding an image tag and I'm going to be giving this an I.D. as a logo.

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,550
Just like that.

44
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,360
Okay, so we have a mistake added.

45
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,200
So now I can go to my index dodgers file and add that particular element.

46
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:43,030
So, first of all, let's go ahead and clear off all the unwanted things and let's import our file that

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,900
we just added.

48
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,100
So I'll say import.

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,620
Logo from.

50
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,810
And in this, we are going to be pointing to a search folder.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,850
And within that, we had the file name as the pack underscore logos.

52
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,410
I'll just copy the entire file name from here and paste it right here.

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,580
Okay.

54
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,710
So our logo is now imported in ideas file now to be using that particular logo.

55
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,030
So I'll say concept.

56
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:16,600
Logo element equals do document dot get element by EDI and that is logo.

57
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,940
Okay, so that's pretty good.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,810
Now I can just be adding that file there so I can see.

59
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,000
Logo element dot as RC equals two.

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,780
And in this we can be pointing to this logo right here.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll just say logo.

62
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:35,980
That's it.

63
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,030
That's pretty much it.

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,990
If you just try to run this particular build once again and let's see what happens.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,100
So I'll just move up a one folder, go to the fifth folder, which I just created and say, NPM, run,

66
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,030
build.

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,840
And you might be pretty much aware by now what's going to happen that our world is going to break.

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,330
Because as you can see, it does not really understand what to be doing with this logo file or the BND

69
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:00,690
file.

70
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,790
Now let's make the configuration in our pack and make it understand what exactly to be doing with that

71
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,120
file.

72
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,610
Now, again, as you can assume, we are loading a file type, so we need to be making some changes

73
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,780
in this module section.

74
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,220
So that's it.

75
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,170
We are going to be adding another object here.

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,310
So we add an object here and put up the test conditions.

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,380
And in this we are going to be using the loaders.

78
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,260
So in the U.S., it's going to be a little bit different.

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,360
Instead of typing in use, we are going to be using another parameter called as type.

80
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,360
So in this type, we are going to be seeing a third.

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,470
And slash resource.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,410
That's it.

83
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,280
And in our test condition, we are going to be adding all the image file types.

84
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,720
So this can be PNG, it can be a JPG.

85
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,420
It can be a gif or probably a swig as well.

86
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,010
So all this file types are going to be supported by our dollars and idea.

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,990
And that's pretty much it.

88
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,950
If I just save it and if I just go to my console and try to run the build once again, we can see that

89
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,110
we have successfully imported that file.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,730
So that's right here.

91
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,480
All right.

92
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,000
Now we can open up our index, start a student files, file, right click and see who will in Finder.

93
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,620
Let's double click on that file.

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,980
And things seems to be not working as expected.

95
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,710
So let's check out what's happening.

96
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,190
So we go to the Inspect tab now to understand exactly why our image is not loading.

97
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,060
We can come to our console and see that we are getting one error on the DOM list.

98
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,940
And this is exactly why our image is not loading for now.

99
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,800
Now, I could have all this behind the scene, but no, I really wanted to see what are the kind of

100
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,380
problems that one can face and how we resolving them.

101
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,170
Now, as you can see, it's failed to execute.

102
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,470
Add on the bottom left so the token provided must not be empty.

103
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,220
So this appeared on the index Dodgers line number 28.

104
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,680
So let's go to our indexed audience.

105
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,920
And if you come here, we can see that we don't see the line number 28 because basically what's happening

106
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,230
is compiling it and it's showing a compiled output.

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,240
So we do not see the exact line numbers, but it is somewhere at the end to as you can see here, it

108
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
is basically on this particular line.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,650
That is where the problem is coming.

110
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,450
Now, what we're trying to do here is we are adding the style object and in that we are trying to find

111
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,590
the class called button.

112
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,580
Now, if I open up the style object, so this is from where this style is coming up and this is in the

113
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,960
index darts access.

114
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,200
So if I go to the index, dot the thesis, we can see that it's been marked as a global module and that

115
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,580
is exactly why we are not able to be adding their dialogue button variable.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,400
So to be fixing this, we can just remove this global property because as you remember, once you are

117
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,070
the global property, it is not exposed on this style object rather is going to be exposed directly

118
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,670
on the DOM.

119
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,570
So if I just go back to my index dot years now, it should be able to find this style property and that's

120
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,680
when this line of code is going to be executed and our logo should be appearing.

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,200
So let me just save all of those files, clear the console and try to run the build once again.

122
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,260
Now, if I switch back to my browser, hit refresh, we can see that the error message is gone and our

123
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:18,890
logo has now appeared and congratulations, you have successfully added image using the image module.

124
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,490
Now the few things that you can be doing for there to be enhancing your build.

125
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,320
So let's see what can be done here.

126
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:31,580
Now if I go to my vs code and check out the dist folder, we can see that it did not just compile the

127
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,030
file.

128
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,720
It also imported that file into the dist folder and it also gave it a random name along with the extension.

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,130
That was the file type.

130
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,200
Also, if you come back to your console, check out the location in Inspect.

131
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,040
You can see that it's actually using the file from the test folder.

132
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,130
So you have this location slash dist and then the file name which was generated by the pack automatically.

133
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,740
So you can see how things are playing along when you are using all this loaders in the web pack.

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,910
Okay.

135
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,440
Now the thing that I like to show you is what if you want to be changing the file name all you want

136
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,260
to be putting it in a folder, how does those things work?

137
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,420
So if you can imagine you have like a huge application, then you have a lot of images floating around.

138
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,350
So the number of files in the disk folder is going to be ramped up quite quickly.

139
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,180
And you need to keep things organized so that in case you need to debug, it's possible to do so.

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,110
So let's see what can be done in our Webpack config.

141
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,880
Now we can add a property in our output, which is going to be helping us change the name of the files

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,100
that have been generated by this particular plugin.

143
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:45,050
So what I can I do it is set module file name and in here we can name it as.

144
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,530
Images flash and then our film that is there now instead of our film, it's going to be generating a

145
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:52,920
hash.

146
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,870
So we're going to be putting up square back it.

147
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,670
Then we say hash and then another square bracket with the extension.

148
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,900
Okay.

149
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,230
So what we're seeing here, what are the assets generated?

150
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,970
We are going to be placing them in the images folder and this is going to be the filing that is going

151
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,600
to be created.

152
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,800
So the file name does not in is the same, but we are also creating it in this particular folder.

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,780
So let's try to run this build once again and we say NPM, run, build.

154
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:25,020
And with that done you can see that our images folder has been created and we have the asset moved over

155
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,290
here.

156
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,670
Now you also see that we have our set created here as well.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,740
Now how can you be cleaning up all this output which is not being used anymore?

158
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,590
What you can be doing is you can be adding another property in the output and say clean.

159
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
And then here we specify the value as true.

160
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,320
Okay with that.

161
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,770
Let me just run the bill once again.

162
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,670
Okay.

163
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,540
So as you can see, our build was successful and it actually removed the file that was not being used

164
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:57,880
anymore.

165
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,300
So now you just have the image in the images folder just to make sure that things are working as expected.

166
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,880
We can go back to our browser, just refresh the page and we can see that the image is still loading,

167
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,640
but this time it's loaded from the images folder, so that's pretty much it.

168
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,170
How do we loading the images in the JavaScript file?

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,720
Let's take a short break and see how we can be using the same module to also load the fonts as fonts

170
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,030
also directly supported by the back five.

171
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,770
So see in a short break.
