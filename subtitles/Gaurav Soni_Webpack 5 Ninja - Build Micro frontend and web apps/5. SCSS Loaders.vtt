00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.440
Welcome back to another video on loaders.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.070
In the last video we were able to successfully use this SS loaders.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.370
We also saw the concepts of modules in CCS.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.170
Now let's take it more further and explore how to be using ESC SS loaders.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
So CCS, as I mentioned earlier, is a thesis preprocessor.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.320
So in that case, let's see what kind of appropriate loaders we want to be using and what configuration

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.400
changes are required.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
So I'm just going to be copying and pasting the excess loader so that we not have to again create those

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.230
estimate and JavaScript files.

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.920
So just take control C and paste it back right here.

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.210
So we have default created.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm going to be renaming this as number four as the SS loaders.

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.130
Okay.

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.460
So we have that created.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.420
Let's open it up.

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.170
And just to give a recap on what was happening, I can just open my sources, view the index dada stimulus

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.420
theory wheel and find it.

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.380
And let's double click this.

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.480
And this was exactly what was happening.

20
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.490
So when we clicked on it, we were getting a list.

21
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.340
Okay, let's change things a bit.

22
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.470
So in this, we are going to be just renaming this CSV file to SC SS.

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.680
So for example, let's make this as a CCS and similar thing can be done for the index.

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.110
Start the SS as well.

25
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.370
So let's make this as as he says.

26
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.120
Okay, the next thing that I need to be fixing are my imports.

27
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.850
So if I go to my index dot, yes, we can see that we are importing this.

28
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.900
He says that's I did that to the Xs.

29
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.350
Same thing can be done for the clear button dot.

30
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.870
Yes.

31
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.460
Okay.

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.290
So all of this is done.

33
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.820
Now, if I just go to my root location, so that is my previous folder.

34
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.360
So we can go to the location as.

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.840
For CSC, as has Laura and Les, Randy and Beam Run Build.

36
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.360
So I would say NPM, run, build.

37
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.250
Okay.

38
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.790
Things seems to be still working fine even though we have renamed devices.

39
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.730
So if I just check out my browser and we do see that things are working fine.

40
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.960
Now what if I add some Excel specific functionalities?

41
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.820
So for example, if we go to declare bartender diseases, I'm going to be using the concept of variables.

42
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.910
So I'll declare a variable here.

43
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.170
Let's call this as button color and let's define the color as red and also used as button color right

44
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.380
here.

45
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.810
So I'll say button color.

46
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.100
Okay.

47
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.580
Nothing.

48
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.910
A lot of it does change, but let's go ahead and build it once again.

49
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.640
Now, if I go back to my browser and say Refresh, we can see that we have lost the property that was

50
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.360
applied earlier.

51
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.730
Now, this is because I was the lawyer does not really understand how to be dealing with this variables.

52
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.360
So for that reason, we need to be installing a couple of dependencies.

53
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.540
So there are two dependencies that we have to be installing.

54
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.190
So let's go ahead and do that.

55
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.890
I'm going to be seeing as NPM install dash, dash, save dev.

56
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.250
And the first one is going to be our loader.

57
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.990
So that is SD as S dash loader.

58
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.920
And we also need to be installing SRS directly.

59
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.850
So that is SC assess the core library that's going to be used.

60
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.570
So let's have both of those things installed, you.

61
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.230
Let's give it a second and we are done.

62
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.040
All right.

63
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.060
The next step, as you can assume, is going to be making the changes in our back file.

64
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.880
So let's head over to all the pack config dodgers.

65
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.700
And in this, let's see what needs to be changed.

66
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.130
Let me just make this shorter.

67
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.710
And we are going to be defining another rule here.

68
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.340
So we have already defined one rule how to be dealing with this cases.

69
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.280
Let's just copy that and paste it here.

70
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.640
And in this, we are going to be making appropriate changes.

71
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.180
So the first thing that we need to be changing is the test condition.

72
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.230
So we are no longer testing for just cases, but instead x's.

73
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.180
So I'll just put here as s.

74
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.650
And as you might be knowing that we can be writing our extension as both SPSS and SPSS.

75
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.260
So we need to be handling both of those condition.

76
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.030
So for that, I can put up a square bracket here and we can make it as as easy.

77
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.580
SS.

78
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.850
So what this is, is the file might be as s SS or SC ss one of these two.

79
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.960
What's there in the brackets?

80
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.790
Okay, so that's done.

81
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.540
Now we need to also be using the loader now fighting the load.

82
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.220
I'm just going to be adding another object here.

83
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.290
Define the loader.

84
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.580
So the loader that we had just installed, that was a SS loader.

85
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.220
And that's that's pretty much it, actually.

86
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.190
Now, what happens here, as we had learned in the previous chapter, the loaders executed from bottom

87
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.550
to top.

88
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.970
So as the SS loader, then this CSIS loader and this guy loader, so SS is loaded, knows how to be

89
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.080
dealing with all the import statements here and converting this into the planes.

90
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.320
SS Which is going to be dealt by this SS loader.

91
00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.350
Then finally the style loader comes in and takes all those pieces and puts it in the index storage HTML

92
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.680
file.

93
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.180
Okay.

94
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.330
So that's all the configuration that's required.

95
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.700
Let's see if I'm right by just running the and being run weld and being run buried.

96
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.620
Okay.

97
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.260
Now this error is basically the way we have configured our regular expressions in our back file.

98
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.470
So let what do to show you what exactly is happening here.

99
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.880
We are trying to be using the x loader along with the x loader.

100
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.950
And in here we have put up the irregular expression as Slash Garcia says.

101
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.740
Now, let me try to show you exactly what's happening here.

102
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.410
I'm going to be copying up this regular expression.

103
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.560
And let's navigate to our website for checking this regular expression so that it rejects.

104
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.650
Ah.

105
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.310
Dot com.

106
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.310
Now in here, I'm going to be pasting up that regular expression that we had.

107
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.300
Let's clear off all this list and let's suppose our filing was index dot SCC.

108
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.000
Now if I have this particular file, you can see that is highlighted in blue and it says that it's a

109
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.390
match.

110
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.320
Well, that's because it is still matching all the characters over here.

111
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.110
Now, to be making it explicit, to be matching exactly this format here, we need to be making some

112
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.700
changes in our regular expressions.

113
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.580
So I'm going to putting up here as Slash.

114
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.990
That's the opposite Slash.

115
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.490
And then after the dot, we are going to be seeing that we need to be matching exactly.

116
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.240
CCIS.

117
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.310
Now if you can see here, it does not match this particular file name.

118
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.930
So I'm just going to be copying this entire.

119
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.090
Let's come back to our we are scored and put our regular expression right here.

120
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.660
All right.

121
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.520
So I just missed a couple of things.

122
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.860
So we need to be putting this as well.

123
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.790
So that's all the change that's required to fix this particular.

124
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.000
So let's try to remove this and try to run our build once again.

125
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.420
And this time you can see that our bill was, in fact, successful.

126
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.170
Now, if I go back to my browser, let's go to the page that has our application running and refresh

127
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.080
it, and we can see that things work as expected.

128
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.490
Now, the benefit of doing this particular way is you can be supporting both users as well as the Xs

129
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.920
format.

130
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.490
So for example, if I go to my index dot access file, I can just come here and rename this to success,

131
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:21.230
fix our import statement as well, save the file, clear the console and try to run the build once again.

132
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.870
And things should work as expected.

133
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.660
So as you can see, things are still applied.

134
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.350
Now this particular file which has the index tasks, is using the local and we have the red color from

135
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.580
the access file.

136
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.020
So that's pretty cool.

137
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.130
As you can see, we're using two types of style formats in a single application.

138
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.920
So that's all about loading these styles in Webpack.

139
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.300
For now, we are going to be seeing some more advanced use cases in which you are going to be splitting

140
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.210
the thesis files.

141
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:54.050
So as you can see, for example, right now, we do not have a different file for us to use as we have

142
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.840
all our cases injected into our actual page.

143
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.370
And that's not the best strategy.

144
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:04.820
So we are fixing all of this later on, but for now we are very happy with both our thesis annexes files

145
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.260
loading in the browser.

146
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.100
All right.

147
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.890
Let's take a short break and continue on with the other loaders.
