WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.330
All right.

2
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.570
Let's start off this video with installing a new plug in now.

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.400
Already created a new folder here.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
So as you can see, I'm in the 8.4 folder and if you get stuck, this is the folder that you need to

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.290
be offering.

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.750
Now, in the 8.4 folder, I'm going to be installing a new dependency that's going to be helping us

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.780
copy the assets from the SRT to the disk folder.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.200
To do that, we are going to be seeing NPM install save dev and this plugin is called us copy web pack,

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.130
plug in.

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.370
Okay.

11
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.100
All right.

12
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.940
With that installed now we can just go to our configuration file and we're going to be adding some couple

13
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.870
of configurations here.

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.900
First of all, let's go ahead and import that kind of plug in.

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:50.180
So we'll say const copy plugin equals to required and the file is copy that plugin.

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.080
Okay.

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.890
So that's the module.

18
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.660
Now we just go to the plugins section and this is where we're going to be adding the configuration.

19
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.330
So as usual, it's going to be a new copy plugin and we pass in the configurations here.

20
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.470
Okay.

21
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.810
So what are the configurations that it takes in?

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.070
Well, you need to be specifying one particular object and that's called as D patterns.

23
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.810
Now, patterns is going to be of type added within which you have multiple objects.

24
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.220
So in this object geometry defining, what are the things that you need to be copying?

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.580
So for example, we need to specify couple of properties here.

26
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.230
So we'll say copy two and we need to be saying copy from and specify the files right here.

27
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.180
Okay.

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.510
So what are we trying to do here?

29
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.390
First of all, we need to be copying the assets and this particular image that's there.

30
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.860
So what I can do over here is I'll say, but not resolve.

31
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.150
And in this I say directory name, comma.

32
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.220
Then as our C slash asserts slash.

33
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.910
And in here I can specify either the file directly.

34
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.990
So for example, there were just one file which generally is not the case in a website.

35
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.490
But let's suppose there is I can just specify the name of the file and it's going to be copying that

36
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.870
file to my desk folder.

37
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.240
Well, if you have a lot of BND files, in that case, what you can do is you can just put up a star

38
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.010
and say Dot BG.

39
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.060
So it's going to be copying all the pages in the assets folder.

40
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.910
So this is fine, but let's suppose you have not just BND, you also have JPG image.

41
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.340
So in that case, how do you copy all the images?

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.630
Well, the best way of doing that is you can just go ahead and create a new folder.

43
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.230
So as a new folder and call this as images and move this into the images folder.

44
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.690
And instead of referring it in the assets, what I can do now is I'll remove all of this and I'll say,

45
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.950
go to the images folder and copy everything that's there in the images folder.

46
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.550
Okay, so that's for the front, but just put a comma in the end and then we need to specify where we

47
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.500
want to be copying it.

48
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.790
So log into it but not resolve.

49
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.590
Directory name.

50
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.060
Comma dist.

51
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.920
Okay.

52
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.690
So these are the basic configuration, but there's one small issue that we are going to be facing.

53
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.230
Now, before I start, let let's try to run the build and see what happens.

54
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.100
So say NPM.

55
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.060
Run Dev.

56
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.540
Okay, let's give it a second.

57
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.880
Okay.

58
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.410
Bet it builders not successful.

59
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.510
And if I open up the dust folder, we can see that we have multiple folders created.

60
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.310
So we have the SRT folder within which we have the assets and within which we have the images.

61
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.870
And finally we have the image idea.

62
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.650
So things are fine, but why is this SRT folder here?

63
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.290
So basically what it did is it copied everything from this location, from the mean, as I say, location.

64
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.630
Now we need to specify to Webpack that what is the context, you know, from where do you want to be

65
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.170
starting copying all of this off location that we are telling it about.

66
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.790
So for that, we need to specify one more property, and that's called the context property.

67
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.680
So in the context, we need to be specifying from where we want to be copying all this stuff.

68
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.250
So we want to start copying from the assets location.

69
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.620
So we want to sort of get this SRT part.

70
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.720
So you say context is SRT okay with that?

71
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.680
Then I can just clear off my console and see NPM run there once again.

72
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.470
Let's give that a second.

73
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.180
Okay.

74
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.430
Now, if I check out my best folder, we just have the assets folder within which we have images and

75
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.110
then finally the image itself.

76
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.140
So that's great.

77
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.780
Our file is now fixed.

78
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
Now, just one small change that I need to be doing is if I go to my index start, I will.

79
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.190
I can see I'm referring directly in the asset, so I just need to make it to refer inside the images

80
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.790
folder.

81
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.420
Okay.

82
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.770
So that's it.

83
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.050
Now, if I just run my server by saying NPM, run, serve.

84
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.340
Let's open up our browser.

85
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.510
And there we go.

86
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.410
We have the image loading directly when we are importing it in the HTML file.

87
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.950
All right.

88
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.140
Now, with that done, let's go back into our code and try to fix the causes page now for fixing the

89
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.020
causes, because the approach is going to be slightly different.

90
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.330
Now, I could, however, just go and copy this and also make sure that the pages folder is getting

91
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.690
copied to the dest folder and that was slightly make it work.

92
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.100
But there's is a problem in that.

93
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.440
The problem is going to be that in the causes DOT estimates that has been generated automatically for

94
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.440
us, we are actually using the estimate of a plug in for doing that and it automatically injects the

95
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.760
course charge's failure.

96
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.760
So if I do check out over here, we can see that the courses are bundled or DS is being outputted all

97
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.660
here automatically.

98
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.210
So instead of copying and pasting the costarred items in here, I'm just going to be updating the hyperlink.

99
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.270
So what I'm going to do is I just go to the index start estimate file, just find the courses link.

100
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.880
So we have the courses right here, let's search it and we have it on line number 50.

101
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.250
So in here you can see that it's going to be just a link and then going to the courses so we can just

102
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.830
remove the pages part and pointed directly to the courses dot achievement and this is supposed to fix

103
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.010
it.

104
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.290
So what I can do now is just run these over again.

105
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:08.140
So I say npm, run, serve and let's wait for the browser to open up and let's click on courses.

106
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.680
And there you see we have the courses dart as page loaded.

107
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.840
Now you can also notice on the browser we do not have these slash pages and more we are directly going

108
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.820
to the courses Dart Edge HTML page.

109
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.380
Now this is generally going to be the approach if you are using a normal medium as he is this kind of

110
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.380
development mode, if you have some sort of single page application using React of View or Angular,

111
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.360
this is not going to be the approach and the routing is going to be handled directly by that framework.

112
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.060
So for now, this is going to work for us.

113
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.380
But there's a couple of issues with this page as well.

114
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.400
As you can see, this styling is not proper.

115
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.430
So if I just inspect on this and go to the console, we can see that a lot of stuff is missing.

116
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.320
So we do not have the course data defined, then we don't have the course starters file.

117
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.420
Let's try to fix all of this issues.
