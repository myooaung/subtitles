1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,620
Let's continue on from the last video and start adding a few more configurations to our back file.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,570
Now we got the entry output and the plug in set up.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,740
Now the next part that I would like to set up is the loaders.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, as you know, the loaders are using the module, so we need to be entering the parameter as module.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,900
And this is going to be of type object.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,620
And within this, it takes a parameter or an key called as rules, which is going to be of the type

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,040
added.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,720
Now, within this, we again need to be creating an object and here we are going to be specifying all

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,260
our loaders.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,570
So first of all, I would like to load all my access and the easiest files.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,050
So let's see how we can be doing the setup.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,730
So we put all here as test and we need to be entering our regular expression so we can type our regular

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
expression like this and put up a dollar sign here.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,460
And next, we need to be specifying the loaders that are going to be used here so that can be defined

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,320
using the use added.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,780
And in here we define all our loaders.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,090
Now I already have all the loaders added to the package or adjacent, so we can just go ahead and add

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,200
those loaders right here.

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,150
So the first loader is going to be our CCS loader.

20
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,760
Then in this start, we need our style loader.

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,140
So that's going to be the style loader.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,630
So if you remember, instead of the style loader, we used to be using another loader during optimization,

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,340
which is to give us a separate file.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,500
Now, in this case, I already have that set up, so I'm going to be using that particular loader.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,160
So that was done using the Minsk's extract plugin.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,440
So for that, I'm just going to be importing that.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,780
Let's go on top and say const Menzies extract plugin equals to required men thesis extract plugin.

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,950
Okay.

29
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,870
So I'm going to be replacing the style loader.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,240
So in case you want directly, things to be added to the animals head.

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,260
So that can be done using style loader.

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,360
But for now I'm going to be using the C users extract plugin and the loader.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,690
Okay.

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,850
So our CSR is part of the set up now.

35
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,760
We need to be creating the same thing for CSR since we have a lot of X files here as well.

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,130
So if you just open up any of the pages, you can see.

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:09,790
Yes, yes.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,550
Now we do not really have courses, but in general you need to be keeping the support for both of them.

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,980
So for that reason, we are going to be adding both of those lawyers.

40
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,330
So as usual, we need to be putting our regular expression first.

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:29,440
So that is a CSR that CSR or here and these are the two formats.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,570
So I can just also write this as this as I generally prefer this format.

43
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:35,830
Okay.

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,590
So we have the loader, we have this CSS loader as as we know, we need to be adding another loader

45
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:41,800
here.

46
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,040
So that is our CSR loader.

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,970
Okay.

48
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,350
So that's also done.

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,950
We have our modules set up.

50
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,880
We also need a module for loading the images.

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,000
So as we know, we have a lot of assets for the images.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,520
So for that, I can just copy this loader one more time and add support for all the images so that can

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,780
be done using this format.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,660
So we'll say jpg png.

55
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,540
Then we have the JPEG, then we have the gif.

56
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,950
And I think that's it for now.

57
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,120
Okay.

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,520
We can remove disclosures since we are going to be using the in-built loader now in bootloader can be

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,620
accessed using the type property.

60
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,180
And in here we see a third flash resource.

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,610
Cool.

62
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,490
So all this is done.

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,210
Now we have the base set up, sort of ready, actually.

64
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,360
Now, another thing that I would like to add over here is my dev.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,660
So.

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,580
So when we are using our application, we need all those hotkey loadings and stuff to work, right?

67
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,080
So for that we need our dev.

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,830
So it'll be set up now using our estimate of a pack plugin.

69
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,230
We are already going to be getting the dest folder within which we have the index such html.

70
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,700
So we can just go ahead and add the dev.

71
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,210
So here.

72
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,550
So let's name this as dev server and this is going to be of type object.

73
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,870
Let me put up a comma here.

74
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,670
And in this we need to be specifying where our that's always going to be running, first of all, so

75
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,790
that can be specified using the static property.

76
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,300
And in this we are going to be specifying directory.

77
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,420
So there's a directory and in this will support.

78
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,380
Dot resolve underscore this name comma defect.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,380
So this is where all our assets are going to be.

80
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,700
Okay.

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,300
We can also add additional properties here which are not added earlier.

82
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,370
So you can also specify things like be put.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200
So where you want to be running your dev.

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,680
So, so let's say for example, this time I won't be running it on the port 9000 and we can also specify

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
things such as open as true.

86
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,130
Now if you remember last time we used to add it in the package addition.

87
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,270
So this is also another way of adding your properties to your dev server.

88
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,030
Now there's also one more property that I would like to add to the config, and that is the mode in

89
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,980
which you are going to be running this entire configuration.

90
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,620
So I want to be running it in the development mode.

91
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:11,970
So in the module dot exports right on top, let's add the mode and this is going to be of mode development.

92
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,920
So that's good.

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,390
Okay.

95
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,600
So the basic things are now sort of set up now.

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,550
We're going to be taking a short break and I'm going to be running this pack configuration and we will

97
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,160
see that things are not really working as expected.

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,090
So we are going to be debugging why it did not work and how do we resolving that?

99
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,880
What are the additional configurations required in the event back file?

100
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,770
So see you after a short break.
