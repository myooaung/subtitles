00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.920
We're progressing pretty well, developing our movie booking application.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.720
So we got all our movies loaded on our homepage and now we're going to be getting all the other pages

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.350
started off.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.820
So let's go back to our we scored now in this fiasco.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.220
Let me just close off all the existing tabs.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.010
We already have those three servers running up.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.730
Now I'm just going to open up all the other applications that we have.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.430
So those are namely the seat selection application as well as this details page application.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.830
So we just need to fire up some new tabs here.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.620
So we have the new terminal window opened up.

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.170
Let me navigate to the 11.1 and within this I'll go to the seed selection app and see NPM, run, serve.

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.530
Okay.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.480
So it says command not found.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.110
That means I've not got the dependencies installed as well as npm install.

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.060
Okay.

16
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.200
So we have the dependency and starting now, let me try and be a so once again.

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.750
Okay.

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.210
So this starts off on the number 3003 and we do not really see any output for now.

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.590
And if you check out the inspect, you will also notice that there are a couple of errors here.

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600
So don't worry about that.

21
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.190
We are going to be fixing them all together.

22
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.710
Let's just fire up another terminal and we're going to be starting of our next server.

23
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.510
So that's going to be the detail page app.

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.980
So I would say KD 11.1, then see details page app, then again do NPM installation.

25
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.380
Okay.

26
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.050
And then we'll see npm bran serve.

27
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.280
Okay, so let's fire that up as well.

28
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.340
And this starts off on the board 3001, and there's no output here as well.

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.890
Now, if you just go to the inspect tab and see the console, we see pretty much the same error so that

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.540
the regenerator runtime error is not defined and we see the same error here as well.

31
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.840
So just a quick tip over here and probably you can bookmark this as well.

32
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.710
If you see this error, this generally means you do not have the policies set up.

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.040
So for fixing this, it's quite simple.

34
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.360
We had done this in the earlier application as well.

35
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.920
So what we need to do here is we just open up our seed selection up here, navigate over to the entry

36
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.220
file.

37
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.590
So in this case, the entry file is this index target and we're just going to be putting up our bolivars.

38
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120
So I'll say import and then I'll say Adelaide, Babel, Bolivar.

39
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.970
So just save that.

40
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250
Let's go ahead and do the same thing for the Details page app as well.

41
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.920
So in the CRC indexed ARGs and let's get that dependency added side.

42
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.830
So the import actor it.

43
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.870
People.

44
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.400
Slash.

45
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.880
Let me just fix that Bible part of it.

46
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.410
Okay, that looks good.

47
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.900
Let me see if that off and go back to my browser.

48
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.090
Let's navigate here and voila we see that we got our application started.

49
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.990
Things are generally broken here.

50
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.990
We do not have the image then.

51
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.360
We also don't have the movies selected here.

52
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.570
So it shows no movie name nor time date and so on.

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.630
Well, we are going to be fixing all of that in the upcoming videos.

54
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.550
For now, we can see that the application is up and running and we do not really have any errors here.

55
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.280
We do have one error regarding the image, but that's fine.

56
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.580
Let's see the other one as well.

57
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.220
So in here also, if I just give it a refresh, you see that the application is in fact loading no image,

58
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.620
but other things seems to be working fine.

59
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.970
There are a few arrows.

60
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.400
This is again because the application is not getting all the data that's required from the other applications.

61
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.050
So don't worry about that.

62
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.890
They're only fixing it.

63
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.970
All right.

64
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.260
So we got all the applications started just going back to our we scored.

65
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.290
We can see that we have like five applications running now.

66
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.630
So that's that's really good and that's quite interesting.

67
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.500
Now we're going to be having one additional application created here after some time.

68
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.900
So let's take a short break and see how the navigation between this application should work and what

69
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.340
is really our objective here.
