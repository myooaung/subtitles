00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.920
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.070
We saw a lot of theory on micro funding and now it's time to start implementing something.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.870
Now, we have already seen what we are going to be implementing that.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.240
That's the movie booking application.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.200
So let me give you a quick overview of how the code has been structured.

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
Now it's mandatory that you have this project already cloned on your computer, and within this you

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.240
are going to be finding a folder called 11 MF Project Base.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.240
So this is going to be our starting point.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.970
You need to be either cloning this or doing the development within this folder itself.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.610
Now, in my case, I replicated this folder and created another one in which the solution is going to

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.230
be for whatever we are discussing here.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.690
So we have the 11.1 folder.

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.500
Now I really recommend to use the terminal of TV's code, since we are going to be having a lot of dummies

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.390
open up by the end of this section.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.010
So what you can do here is you can just go on the top, say terminal and say new terminal to get the

16
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.030
terminal opened up.

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
You can also use Bru or your terminal on your Mac, whatever you're comfortable with.

18
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.280
But just remember that we are going to having a lot of terminals in the end.

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.580
Okay, so let's have this terminal open here.

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.910
And I'm going to be navigating to the folder 11.1.

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.520
And we need three applications that need to be started off for getting our project started.

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
So we are just going to be starting off with this MF Solar and we are then going to be starting off

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.300
this home based application.

24
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.180
And finally, the React component application.

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.210
Now, just to give you an overview of what's that in all of this folders, it's just a basic React application

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.110
that we created in the previous section.

27
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.730
We already saw how to be building a React application using Webpack.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.860
So it follows exactly that structure.

29
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.330
Just to give you an overview.

30
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.250
Let's open up the details page application.

31
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.710
In here we have the SC folder.

32
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.320
Within this we have the components of example.

33
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.670
It just has one component here.

34
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.220
The details contained dot gsx.

35
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.470
And then we have some other bootstrapping files like the SAP dodgers and the index dodgers.

36
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.970
We already seen all of this when we had done the React application setup.

37
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.990
All right.

38
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.920
And regarding the Webpack configuration, I have also done all the basic Webpack configurations here.

39
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.220
So we got all the basic plug ins required, the input and the output part has been specified.

40
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.620
The dev server has been configured to start off.

41
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.320
We have all the ports configured here as well.

42
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.400
Now I've also made sure that we are using different ports for every application.

43
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.270
So for example, in this detailed page application it is 3001.

44
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.030
And if you just open up some of the application like this home page application, let's go to developer

45
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.460
config.

46
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.560
You can see it's like 3000 over here and it's going to be different for every single application.

47
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
So in the seed selection it is 3003.

48
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.180
Now if you are going to be using the same port, you're going to be seeing a conflict when you are going

49
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.630
to be starting off the application that the port is already being used.

50
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.550
So make sure that there's no other application using the same port and case that is, and you are not

51
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.930
able to stop that application.

52
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.590
You can just come to this configuration and change the port number.

53
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.230
Okay.

54
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.700
So with that said, let me close this off, minimize the things that we're not using for now.

55
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.150
Now, I'm going to be going to this folder.

56
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.150
So I'm going to be starting off the first application, which is the MF server.

57
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.270
So let's go to that folder, CD server.

58
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.470
And first of all, I need to be installing the dependencies by saying NPM install.

59
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.370
So this is the first time we are starting it off.

60
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.700
So we need to do that because the dependencies installed now AC and PM run dev.

61
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.290
So this is going to be starting of ourselves.

62
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.090
We can see that the application started on port number double five, double five.

63
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.310
To make sure that things are looking, you can just go to your browser and we only have this open here

64
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.910
and I can just refresh this and on localhost port double, double, five slash movies, I get all the

65
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.530
data regarding the movies.

66
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.600
Okay, let's go back.

67
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.210
Let's get our second application running to start up multiple terminals in voice code.

68
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.820
You can just click on this plus button here and we have the other terminal opened up again.

69
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.550
I'm going to be navigating to the same folder 11.1.

70
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.700
And in this I have my folder.

71
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.630
Called as home page application.

72
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.700
So I go to the homepage app and again we do the NPM installations since this is the first time.

73
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.850
And then we see NPM run dev.

74
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.150
I'm sorry, this is NPM run server, so I've sort of configured it a little bit differently here.

75
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.510
Okay.

76
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.650
So that is done.

77
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.760
And we can see that the server or the application has started on board number 3000.

78
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.070
We have the quick booking component loaded here and no more regards for now, but soon we are going

79
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.390
to be developing that as well.

80
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.040
Okay, let's go back to our voice code and get our third application running.

81
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.700
Okay.

82
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.700
So again, we click on the last button, go to the new application folder, CD, LAMB Point one, and

83
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.720
then we go to the application called as React component.

84
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.510
So I'll type in React component.

85
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.390
And then we say again, NPM installation.

86
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.640
Okay.

87
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.930
Got all of those things installed and I say again and pm run, serve.

88
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.970
So it's starting of this hour on board 3002.

89
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.820
And you can see that it has a couple of components.

90
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.920
So we got like the movie card component.

91
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.580
So this is what we're going to be using into our main application right here.

92
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.650
So they'll load the card here.

93
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.150
So this is where it's going to be loaded.

94
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.310
Then we got a couple of button components so you can see some cool looking buttons here, which are

95
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.180
also going to be using.

96
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.790
So I really like this one particular.

97
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.350
And we also got another thing called typography.

98
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.830
So in this, we have different kind of styles which you can be using.

99
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.310
And finally, we have like a dropdown component as well.

100
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.470
Okay.

101
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.320
So we're going to be using a couple of these, not probably all of them.

102
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.190
I just wanted to show like, how can your component library look like and how you can be exporting those

103
00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.670
components?

104
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.870
So for that reason, I have a lot of components here, but we are going to be using a couple of them,

105
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.220
so you'll get the idea about it.

106
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.530
Okay.

107
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.240
So just make sure that you have all these three applications running for now.

108
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.450
We are not going to be starting of the other two for now.

109
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.770
Just keep this tree ready.

110
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.620
See, how do we connecting these among each other?

111
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.330
And then we'll see the other two.

112
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.760
And then we start of the other do so as well.

113
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.230
Now, it's really important that you sort of remain organized using your terminals.

114
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.850
So just to give you a quick overview for switching between the terminals, you can just click here and

115
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.960
switch between the terminals.

116
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.110
And over here to show you the application that's running.

117
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.830
So it shows all MF Solar.

118
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.410
This is the homepage application and this is the React Components application.

119
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.780
So we are going to be starting and stopping this.

120
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.250
So a couple of times.

121
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.470
So just make sure that, you know, you are comfortable navigating around with this terminals.

122
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.670
Okay.

123
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.650
So that's about it.

124
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.870
We got our three applications running on three different ports.

125
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.240
Nothing is really connected among each other.

126
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.800
But we are going to be getting everything connected soon in the upcoming videos.
