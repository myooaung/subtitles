1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,350
I'm super excited.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,430
I'm going to be presenting you the project that we're going to be working on and developing using the

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,540
micro frontend approach.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,790
Now as you can see in front of me, this is going to be like a movie booking application that we're

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,600
going to be developing.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,540
Now we are not going to be doing a lot of HTML, CSS and the basic Webpack stuff, which we have already

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,500
covered in the past.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,550
We are going to be seeing things specifically just for this micro frontend.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,750
So before that, let me give you a tour of what we are going to be developing.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,540
So this is going to be our main page or the homepage in which it shows all the movies that are available

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,220
and are going to be playing in our theaters.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,200
And we also have another component on this page, which is the quick booking component.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,070
So in the quick booking component, who can just select the movie that you would like to watch?

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,380
You can select the date and time.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,450
Now, if you click on any of the movie posters of example, let's click on Captain America.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,150
And in this you can see we have the details about this movie, and you can also book the movie from

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,360
here.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,160
So you also have a drop down here to select the movies, select the time, and then click on the book

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,520
button.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,350
Now let's go back.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,090
So one fun fact our theater only plays Marvel movies, so that's pretty cool, right?

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,800
Okay, so if I just click on my booking button right here on the top.

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,320
So let's say, for example, I select Spiderman, select some data, and let's click on the book button.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,840
So we're taking out our booking page.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,360
So this is our booking page where we select our seats.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,750
So we have the movie name listed here, the date and the time that we had selected as the poster of

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,290
that movie.

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,300
We also have the seat selection, so you can just click on this and the seat gets ticked.

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,090
And also, we have this date getting updated here.

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,900
So you have currently selected three seats and the total cost of $30.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,080
And if you just click on the book button, we can see that it is the movie has been booked and this

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
huge selected number three.

33
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,540
So that's pretty much it for our application.

34
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,840
It looks quite simple.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,890
It's quite straightforward.

36
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,750
But trust me, we are going to be learning a lot of the basics that are covered in micro funding and

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,290
that are going to be used for developing this application.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Okay.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,900
So that's good.

40
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,530
Let me just go back to my homepage.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,490
So that's right here.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,230
And please note that all the data that we are loading or here is all dynamic.

43
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,140
We are actually using a server to load all this data.

44
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Nothing has been hardcoded as such.

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,150
So let me just show you how the data is coming in here.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,270
So if I just open up another tab and run localhost, double, five, double five slash.

47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,050
Movies so we can see that we are returned with all the movies that are playing.

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,580
We got like the name, the image, you are all some description and this was actually running on my

49
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,390
local computer.

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,250
So we are going to be running couple of ways actually to run this and that application.

51
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,430
Now, with that said, let me also give you a showcase of how everything is being architected in this

52
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,090
application.

53
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,400
What are the different applications that are running?

54
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,100
And then we will see exactly how to be developing this.

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,080
All right, so I have my diagram created as what are the different applications that are running?

56
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,930
Please note and think applications.

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,320
These are not just components.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,130
So the different applications are one the homepage we have the details page, we have the booking application,

59
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,780
which is the main application which is going to be containing all the other applications here.

60
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,580
Then we have a server application and also a React components application.

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,150
So a little couple of servers are going to be running on our local computer.

62
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,410
Now, let me just show you where are all these applications in a visual way.

63
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,180
So if I just come here.

64
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,990
So this was our homepage in which we had the quick booking on top.

65
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,780
Then we had this movies, you know, containers.

66
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,050
So as you can see, this quick booking is just a component.

67
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,550
That's why it's been marked in blue.

68
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,180
And this yellow is denoted by the homepage application.

69
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,130
So if I just see here, this is yellow as well.

70
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,290
So that's the homepage application running.

71
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,440
Now in the homepage application you can see that I have this red bordered box here and if you just compare

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,710
here, red bordered box is our React component application.

73
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,330
So this is actually a other application that is running within our homepage.

74
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,620
So that's pretty cool, right?

75
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:06,760
Okay.

76
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,260
Let's see the other pages that we have.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,430
So the other applications that we have is the details page.

78
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,580
So as you can see, the details page has been marked in green.

79
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,810
So if we just go up, the green is our details page application.

80
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:26,290
Now if I just go down and we see what other components are being used here, so we can see that there's

81
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,100
no other components as such being used to directly the UI component.

82
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,040
So that's like a clean page, no other dependencies as such, but let's see the other pages or the other

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,090
components that we have.

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,030
So let's see the other applications that we have running.

85
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,550
So we have the booking application again in the booking application, all the things are being done

86
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,290
locally in this application itself and no other UI dependency as such.

87
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,220
All right.

88
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,420
So that looks pretty good.

89
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,010
So we are going to be seeing how to be putting up all this application using micro frontend.

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,420
So I'm really excited.

91
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,190
Let's move on to the next video and see the code structure, how things are going and what do you need

92
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,550
to be doing on your local computer to be following along with me?
