00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.530
All right.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.350
So we were able to navigate to the new page, but we are not getting all the details.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.390
Now, this is not very difficult to fix.

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.280
So what we need to do is, first of all, we need to be making some changes in our rollout itself.

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.660
So right now, we are not passing any parameter to the out.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.360
So what I'm going to do here is I'm will do passing a parameter by saying slash, then colon and IED.

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.720
So this is going to be the IED of the movie that we are trying to click.

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.860
Now, once we have done that, we also need to be modifying this history dot push.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.250
So in the history dot push, I'm going to be changing this from the double code to back picks and C

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.720
slash then dollar movie dot IED.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.940
So this is going to be the IED of movie that we want to be passing it as a parameter.

12
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.920
Okay, so that looks good.

13
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.200
If I go back to my browser and if I just go back to my homepage and try to click on any of the movie,

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.650
we in fact do see that the part parameter has been passed.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.600
Now there's one problem here.

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.120
When we are navigating to a new page here, this is not just a new page in the same application.

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.940
This is a entirely new application itself.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.030
And if I just go back to the code, we have something called as the use location in the reacted out.

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.390
Adam.

20
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.530
So if I just come here and see a comma use location.

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
So using this location we can actually be reading what's going on in the address bar.

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.350
So it can basically be picking up all the parameters that are added over here.

23
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.370
So if I just go back to the code and open up the details content component.

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.190
So I just give you a look on how this component is working.

25
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.130
So this component is expecting a while, props.

26
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.860
So this is an attribute and the attribute name should be location within that it expecting a bottom

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.710
and then it's time to split it on the slash.

28
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.380
So basically it is going to be reading this and part splitting on this slash and then picking up the

29
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.820
last value that's right here.

30
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.680
So once it gets the value, then it's going to be filtering out all the data from the movies list and

31
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.240
then try to display the movie here.

32
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.420
So that's behind the scene, what's happening in that component.

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.030
So our objective is to somehow past location, object to this new application.

34
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.360
So we need to be passing this property called location.

35
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.030
So for that reason, I just go back to my app.

36
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.800
Dargis in my movies application and in here I just go to the details page and we pass in a location

37
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.370
attribute.

38
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.860
So the location is equal to what?

39
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.460
Well, the location is going to be this use location value.

40
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.330
So we'll see.

41
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.250
Const location equals to use location.

42
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.430
All right, so we can just pass this location here just like this.

43
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.470
And that's pretty much it, actually.

44
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.680
So now if I just try to save this file, go back to my browser, just give this page a refresh.

45
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.550
And if I just click on any of the items now, we can see that actually we are navigating to the right

46
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.910
movie.

47
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.470
So we clicked on Avengers and we are showing all the details of Avengers along with the picture.

48
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.000
So that looks pretty good.

49
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.850
Our application is taking shape, so I could have done it in multiple ways, this entire navigation,

50
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.100
but I just wanted to show you the different approaches.

51
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.770
So right now we are exploring the callback approach in which we are passing a callback from the details

52
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.120
content component back to our main applications app dogs.

53
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.420
And from there we are trying to do the navigation to the new page.

54
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.030
And when we wanted a positive port parameter, since we wanted to read the location, we can also pass

55
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.850
in parameters to a different application itself.

56
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.140
So I'm just trying to give out the different kind of use cases that you might be facing when you are

57
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.760
implementing a real application.

58
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.900
All right.

59
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.110
So we got a click event listener working on our movie cards.

60
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.670
So that's on the homepage and then we have the movie cards.

61
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.370
Now we are going to be taking a short break and then explore how do we navigating from this book button.

62
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.960
Now you might be thinking it's quite similar since it's the same page, we can just do the same thing.

63
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.330
What we have done here, but it's not really the case is going to be slightly different all year and

64
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.610
I'm going to be telling you why in the next video.
