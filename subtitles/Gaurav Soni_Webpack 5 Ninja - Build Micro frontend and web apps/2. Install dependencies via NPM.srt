1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,250
You guys will come back in the last few days.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,370
We saw the website that we're going to be optimizing.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,990
Now, let's get started with this.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,060
And before we start off, let me just give you an overview of how the website structure looks like.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,200
Now, when you download the source code for this entire course, you're going to be finding a folder

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,270
called US Course Project, Underscore Base, and this is going to be the starting point for this particular

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,720
section.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, I wanted to created on the fold of my mike, if in which I'm going to be starting the optimization

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,030
and trying to keep things organized in case you get stuck.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,140
All right.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
So with that, let's get started and explore what exactly that inside this folder.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,680
So in this folder, you're going to be finding the starting file that is the index artist email, which

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,890
contains all the data that was there on the main front page.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,610
Now, this also has associated indexed ideas for loading and making things dynamic here, and we also

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,410
have a CSV file attached to that.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,140
Now we also have another folder called pages in which we have the cold storage animal and the Associated

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,370
Ghost Dogs file.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,390
Along with that we have a Libs folder.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,950
Within that we have the library called Twist and in that it also has the to start CFS.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Now you can immediately notice that we are going to be using both X's as well as this uses format and

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,650
this is going to help us explore the full potential of that back.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,700
Okay.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,880
Moving on, we have a decent file as well that is going to be loaded.

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,210
And finally, we have a search folder in which you have some of the X files and some of the formats

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,540
file.

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,640
As you can see here, we also have kept image file and that is the main banner that was used on the

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,150
website.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,260
Okay.

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,260
So that's about the folder structure.

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,360
Let me quickly minimize all of this and let's see what is going to be the approach for optimizing this

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,200
entire project.

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,540
So first of all, I'm going to be installing the basic dependencies and then do the basic configuration

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,680
file, the pack file.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,790
So once we have that done, we are going to be setting up the stable file.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,050
That was the dynamic edge HTML directly in our best folder and then get developed.

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,110
Baghdad Solar started now designed to keep the Webpack dev server in the start because as in when we

37
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,330
start fixing and modifying it, I can immediately see what's happening in the browser as well as automatically

38
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,210
building the bundle and fix the errors on the way.

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,500
Okay.

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,170
Once that is done, we are going to be fixing all our imports and then move all our assets and dependencies

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,070
via NPM.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,880
And finally, we are going to be moving the assets in the disk folder.

43
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:27,990
Okay.

44
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,720
So all that history does on a very high level what we are going to be doing, let's move on and do some

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,440
implementation.

46
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,600
So I'm going to be starting off the implementation with the index start HTML file.

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,120
Now if you go at the bottom, you can see that all the dependencies for now are being loaded with CDM.

48
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,080
So we got like the bootstrap because jQuery we have typed, then we have validate roster and load.

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
Now, the number one thing that I want to be doing is move all the dependencies that we see or hear

50
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,940
into the index cards file.

51
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,140
Now, this is exactly where the full potential of the pack is going to be used.

52
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,610
So let's get started with that.

53
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,030
So what are we opening up the terminal on this folder?

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,430
So let's hit the terminal command and we have the terminal started here.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,870
Okay.

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,030
Now, with the terminal started, I'm going to be moving over to that folder.

57
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,100
So there's the 8.1 folder.

58
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,070
So let's go to the CD, 8.1.

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,570
And now we're in the folder.

60
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,860
Okay.

61
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,400
Now, as you can see, we do not even have a package or decent file here.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,400
So to initialize this as a NPM repository so that we can add the dependencies via NPM, we can use to

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
come on and beam in it.

64
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,490
So I see NPM in it.

65
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,020
And then it's going to be asking you a couple of questions, such as what is the name of the package

66
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,470
and so on.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,640
So for now, I'm just going to be using the default value for all the options.

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,080
Okay.

69
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,490
So as soon as I do that, I should be having the package that Jason created for me.

70
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,860
Okay, so that looks pretty good.

71
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,360
Now we have the basic package addition, and now we can start installing the dependencies.

72
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,990
So by installing the dependencies, I'll type in npm install.

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,520
Then I'll say save.

74
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,460
And the dependencies that we need are Lord.

75
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,800
So we'll put in the spelling.

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,910
Right, Lord Ash.

77
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,950
Then we also need jiggery.

78
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,160
Then we are going to be using the typed dogs that typed dot g's.

79
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,710
Now, if you want to be validating any of the names, what you can do is you can just go to the NPM

80
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,740
repository and and I actually have all of them open here.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,670
So, for example, for typed, we can follow that.

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,600
You need to be installing NPM, install typed dogs.

83
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,200
That's what we have done for the equity.

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,300
We just need to be using the words equity.

85
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,400
We have done that as well.

86
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,810
For validated dogs, we just need to be adding value to Georgia.

87
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,770
So I'm just currently copying this from here.

88
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,660
And then we can put it right here.

89
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,760
So space and then validate ideas and then let's see what else is required.

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,490
We need another dependency called toaster.

91
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,700
So let's copy that name and edit right here and let's move on to the next one.

92
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,540
So that's loads and then finally bootstrap.

93
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,060
So I'll just install both of them as well.

94
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,050
We already have added loads so we can just proceed with bootstrap.

95
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,080
Okay.

96
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,150
So all of my dependencies have been added.

97
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,680
Let's go ahead and install of them.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,510
Now, it might take a couple of seconds as there were a lot of dependencies and now we can see our package

99
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,140
addition has been updated with all the dependencies.

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,340
Okay.

101
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,710
So that was the dependencies for the project.

102
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,900
The next dependency is for that pack.

103
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,590
So for now, we are just going to be installing two of them.

104
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,290
So that is the default one.

105
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,700
One is NPM install save dev.

106
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,970
We are going to be installing this as dev dependencies and that is going to be the back and the back

107
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,810
CLIA.

108
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,590
Awesome.

109
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,670
So these are the two basic dependencies that is required by the pack.

110
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,530
Now what we are going to be doing next is we are going to be creating our basic VAT back file.

111
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,980
So in here I can just right click and see a new file and we can call this as well.

112
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,210
Backdoored config dot.

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,930
Yes.

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,250
Okay.

115
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,650
So that's done for now.

116
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,910
I'm not going to be adding any of this.

117
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,210
But we can just close this for now, close the package or Jason and close those instructions as we have

118
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:19,990
gone through it once.

119
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,950
And finally, we are going to be moving to our index charges.

120
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,450
And in our index charges, we can start importing all those dependencies.

121
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,430
So via scroll on the top, this is where we are going to be adding our dependencies.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,560
So in here we can say import and then you can be adding all the import statements or one was for g equity.

123
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,590
So I can see dollar from.

124
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,000
J.

125
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,530
So is the equity generally denoted by the dollar sign?

126
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,460
So I've used that over here and then we can import loads.

127
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,680
So let's just quickly make sure that we are using Lordship.

128
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,720
So as you can see, we are using it for the build for our items.

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
So we need Lord Asher as well.

130
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,270
So I say import underscore from Lord Ash.

131
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,110
Then we also need booster for the styling.

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,250
So I would say import boot strap from bootstrap.

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,480
Okay.

134
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,260
Last but not the least, we need to define a dependency that is for type.

135
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,360
So import type.

136
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,150
From typed dogs.

137
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,390
Okay, now for tape, just make sure that you're using the capital t o here, because we can see that

138
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,040
we're using this motif and we are initializing the type library.

139
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,680
So just make sure that you have the capital T when you're importing it.

140
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:39,820
Okay.

141
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,110
So with that done, if we try to run the build, everything is going to be breaking because we do not

142
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,620
have any configuration done yet.

143
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,630
Endeavor back file.

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,340
So let's take a short break and start making basic configuration in the Webpack file.
