00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.680
Welcome back to another video.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.380
In the last few days, we saw how do we lauding the images?

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.860
Now we're going to be using the same concept to load the forms as well.

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.470
We do not need any external order for this.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.020
So let's see how forms loading work.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.960
Now I'm going to be copying this folder as usual.

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.390
So let's say copy paste and if you want you can be continuing on in the last folder.

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.030
But I would just like to keep it separate.

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.940
So I'll just rename this to font loads and that's pretty much it.

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.280
So first of all, we're downloading the font.

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.330
So for that purpose let's open up our browser and let's head over to the forms Google.com and let's

12
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.340
select one of the forms that we may like.

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.060
So let me say something maybe in recursive format, something like this, and I'm going to be using

14
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.600
this font.

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.540
So what you can do here is you can say download family and this is going to be downloading the font

16
00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.260
right here.

17
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.690
Let's open up the font and we need to be copying this font to also was directory.

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.340
So let's head over to our code and I'm going to be copying that right here.

19
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.760
So let's control so you control we right here.

20
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.680
And then I'm just going to be creating another folder into my assets folder.

21
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.980
So we are going to be keeping all the forms here and let's move this font to our foreign statically.

22
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.900
Okay, so that's pretty much it.

23
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.970
We have the new font ready for usage.

24
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.620
Now for making the usage, we are going to be making Zoom updates in this case.

25
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.030
So if you go to the access file, we need to be adding a new frontier.

26
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.190
So let's see how we can be doing that.

27
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.220
If I go back to the browser, you can see that it has already provided me with the font family that

28
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.500
I need to be writing so I can just copy that from here.

29
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.940
Come back to my C.

30
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.280
S file and paste it right here.

31
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.080
Okay, so that's done.

32
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.630
Now we need to be applying this on our title or now ahead of where we need this one to be applied.

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.620
So for that, we can just head over to our index start adjustment.

34
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.870
And I want to be applying it right here.

35
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.550
So how do we do that?

36
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.070
Well, it's quite straightforward.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.110
We go to our index dot gas file and we already have the elements selected.

38
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.480
So as you know, whenever we click on the button element, it's going to be selecting that header and

39
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.150
then we can perform any action on it as we like.

40
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.250
So what I'm going to be doing here is I'll say element dot class list dot hard, and in here I'm going

41
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.310
to be adding a new class size style dot and this is called as header.

42
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.820
Now please note that earlier we were selecting the headers through it.

43
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.710
That's why it was having the idea selector.

44
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.830
Let's remove this and make it a class selector.

45
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.540
So with that, let's go back to our DSC file and let's put it here as head of all right, now that's

46
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.870
done.

47
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.820
Now we only apply this style, but we also need to be calling that font file that we had just added

48
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.060
here.

49
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.030
So for that, I can also add the font file here itself.

50
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.270
So I say import or slash assert forms and then the name of the font.

51
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.210
So let me just come here, copy the entire name.

52
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.240
Close this and paste it right here.

53
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.120
All right, now we have all of this.

54
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.390
Now, if I ran NPM build, what do you expect to happen?

55
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.200
Well, if you expect it to fail, you're absolutely right.

56
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.580
So I'll just prove that to you.

57
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.050
Now, if I just go to my A directory, which is the sixth folder and see NPM, run, build, and if

58
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.820
we just give it a second, we can see that it's not able to identify this file TDS file.

59
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.260
So as you can expect, we need to be making some configuration changes in that back file.

60
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.290
So coming back to Webpack, we go all the way to the bottom and this is exactly where we are going to

61
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.580
be hiding the new loader.

62
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.060
So in here, let's add copy and paste the earlier one because we are going to be using the same asset

63
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.430
slash resource for loading the forms as well.

64
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.990
Not only how we can put in all the types of foreign files that we're going to be supporting.

65
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.580
So that can be TDF, then it can also be W.f., F and W or F2.

66
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.830
So a couple of more font files that you can use, but I'm just going to be keeping this for now as per

67
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.030
my project requirement.

68
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.220
Let's see if that cleared the console and try to run the build once again.

69
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.480
Okay.

70
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.130
So this time we can see everything passed off successfully and things should work as expected.

71
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.030
So I'm just going to be opening up my index start A.T.M. once again.

72
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.260
So I'll say Reveal and Finder as double click this and try to open it up.

73
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.860
Now this format is going to be applied only when I click on the button.

74
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.590
So as you can see, as soon as I clicked that the font got applied and we can also validate that by

75
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.820
going to the inspect tab.

76
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.310
And if you see on the right we can see that the font family was this one that we had just installed.

77
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.900
Okay, so that's pretty much it.

78
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.760
On how you're going to be loading the font.

79
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.240
And as you can see, we're using the inbuilt modules of Webpack to be loading these kind of files,

80
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.620
and you do not need to be installing anything explicitly from the NPM repository.

81
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.030
So that's it for now.

82
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.690
Let's take a short break and continue on with the last video on loaders.
