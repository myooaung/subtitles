You guys.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,670
Welcome to our final video on loaders.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,800
We have learned a lot in this module.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,020
We saw how to be loading different types of files.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,930
We also saw how to be loading different types of CFS.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,200
That is the CFS and the normal CSS files.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,690
We saw the concept of modules and so on.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,730
Now before we close up this section, I would like to just make you go through the documentation where

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,010
you can be getting more information about the loaders.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,590
Now, if you head over to the VAT bags dot what documentation, you can see that we have one section

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,080
on loaders which had already seen earlier in this.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,810
You have a variety of loaders but you have not seen as well.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,130
We have not yet cover the Jason loader, but the concepts are pretty much the same.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,260
So you can just have this loader implemented and now you know what exactly this modules section does

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,030
and how to be using this loaders.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,080
Moving on.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,510
We also saw one of the building modules that were there in the loaders and that was using the asset

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,650
slash resources.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,780
Now if you want to be exploring more on this, you can come to this guide submenu and in this you are

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,420
going to be finding one section called as the asset module.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,250
And this is exactly what we are using.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,340
And you can just go to this documentation to get more information about on what are the other different

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,330
types of things that are going to be loading using the built in asset module.

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,850
So that's about it for loaders.

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,020
So let's move on to the next section in which you are going to be covering another important topic of

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,610
Webpack, and that is the plug ins.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,410
So let's move ahead and see what is plugins and how it can make our day one better.
