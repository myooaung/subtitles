00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.240
Okay.

2
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.890
This is going to be a very quick video.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.570
We just need to be updating the UI.

4
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.510
So for that, we can just open up our obvious code.

5
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.680
And I already have the function set up over here actually for loading the booking.

6
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.060
So we have that function here.

7
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.310
The only thing that we need to be doing is the data that we receive over here.

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.850
We need to be calling that function.

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.000
So let me just add the collaborators over here.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.720
And in this, we can also we can log the message and probably after logging the message, I'm also going

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.530
to be calling this.

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.040
Load booking and POS in the booking data.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.110
So that's just well in our case.

14
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
So basically this load booking is going to be calling this function here and then this is going to be

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000
setting this date and that's how our was going to reload.

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.480
So that's the only the thing that you need to be doing.

17
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.320
Just save this.

18
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.890
And if I just go back to my homepage and this time if I navigate, I should hopefully be getting this

19
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.760
seed booking page rendered properly.

20
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.990
So let's just go ahead and probably update the date.

21
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.080
Let's make this as tree and let's change the time as 8 p.m. and click on the book button.

22
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.120
And in fact, you can see that we have got the 8 p.m. and we also got the image since the movie IDs

23
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.950
are also being sent.

24
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.100
So the movie name over here and you have a fully functional booking app, although you won't be able

25
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.480
to go to the movie with this app.

26
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.590
Right.

27
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.860
You can also click on any of this side booking and just click on the book button and you have your movie

28
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.190
ready.

29
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.150
Okay.

30
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.680
So that was about how do you be consuming the events, how to be getting all of the things done.

31
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.770
Now, this is one small thing that I would like to add further.

32
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.370
Now, when we are on any of the movie apps, so let's click on this.

33
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.820
Captain America, I also have a book now button over here.

34
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.970
Now, when I click on any of those items here, I and when I click on the book button, I again need

35
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.850
to be navigated to the speed booking application.

36
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
And in that I need to be showing the content that has been selected over here.

37
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.850
So if you want to take it as a challenge, you can just do that or you can just continue along with

38
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.250
me and I'm going to be implementing this in the next video.
