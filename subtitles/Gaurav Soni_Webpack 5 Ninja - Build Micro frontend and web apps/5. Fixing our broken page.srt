1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,500
All right.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,490
In the last video, we got things working, but there was one problem that the thesis was not getting

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:05,940
copied.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,690
Now, I'm going to be telling you the reason why it did not work.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,680
But we're going to be fixing this properly in the upcoming section and we're going to be automating

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,600
all of this what we are going to be doing now manually.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,920
So going back to our code and if you go to the index statistics in the test folder, we can see that

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,780
we have the reference for the excess.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,620
That's right here.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,160
But the difference is still to the local folder.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,470
So as you can see, this dot slash index starts the SS.

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,580
And as you can see, we do not really have devices cases in the test folder.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,380
So how do we fix it?

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,350
Well, for now it's quite straightforward.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm just going to be copying both the cases files and pasting it right here.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,030
Okay.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,790
So with those the SS files present, if I go back to my browser C refresh and we can see that things

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,530
are looking better, we have the cases loaded, the things like the images are still breaking.

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,550
So if I go back to the code and try to go to the GC files, so if you go to the index store these file

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,820
and if you check out the image source, it was located in dot slash asserts and then it goes to the

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,600
image name.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,560
So for that reason we need to be creating a third folder and then we need to be basically copying all

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,980
of this that we have and moving it into this other folder.

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,320
So just copy and paste it right here.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,130
So with that done, let me just close this and try to go back to my browser and hit refresh and voila,

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,650
we see that things are working as required.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,530
Now I'm doing all of this manually because I want you to understand behind the scene what back is going

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,420
to be helping us with now later on, what we are going to be seeing is how we can be moving the assets

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,780
directly from the CRC folder to the DEST folder.

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,980
Now will end object.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,840
It should be that the disk folder should be containing all the assets, all the resources that are required

33
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,460
for running our application independently, and we are going to be achieving that very soon.

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,410
So for now you saw that.

35
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,520
What are the steps that we had to do manually to get our application working?

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,320
Alright with that fix, let's take a short break and in the next video we are going to be using one

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,210
of the most important part of that back and that is hot reloading or reloading.

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,400
So in that we do not really have to be coming again and again and running the build and this is going

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,680
to be really helpful when we are doing our development.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,810
So see you soon in the next video.
