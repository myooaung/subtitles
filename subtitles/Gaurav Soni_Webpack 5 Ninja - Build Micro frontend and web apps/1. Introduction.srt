00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,340
Welcome to this course unwrapped back in India.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,190
My name is Gaurav and I'm going to be the instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,810
I've been doing software development for over ten years and I'm going to be sharing my knowledge what

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:15,840
I've got regarding the tools, especially the back that is used widely, and we ought to be building

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,130
a frontend application.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,230
And this is especially true in the current world where we have this single page application all around.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,720
Generally when we use the single page applications, we are using some sort of skills for building those

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,440
applications.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,630
But behind the scenes, most of the skills are using Webpack for bootstrapping your application.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,070
So we are going to be seeing exactly how those calls work and what they do behind the scenes.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,270
So this is have overview of what this entire course contains.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,480
So we are going to be starting off with the basics of Webpack.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,970
And in this we are going to be seeing some of the core concepts such as the loaders, the plugins and

14
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,870
also modules.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,540
Modules is really important because this is the fundamental of the entire application that we're going

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,140
to be building.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,540
We are also going to be seeing different kind of modules that as the commandeers types module as well

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,550
as the S6 kind of modules.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,640
Okay.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,890
Once our basics are sort of cleared and we know what we are doing with that pack, we are going to be

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,800
seeing some more in-depth concepts such as Hot Reloading, Dependency Management, Thesis Module and

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,170
Dynamic Import, and all this concept is going to be actually implemented on a project.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,450
So I've created a simple thesis project and we are going to be implementing all this concept on a live

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,040
website.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,700
So we are going to be having a very good understanding after this project.

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:33,690
Okay.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,890
Once we are done with this project, we are going to be moving forward and check out those optimizations

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,330
that are provided by Webpack.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,200
These optimizations are such as the mundane analysis because the duplicate prevention and the reloading.

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,720
So these are some of the advanced concept which are going to help you make the application even faster

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,470
and also debug things, which is not going very well in your application.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,850
Okay.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,730
Once you are done with the optimization in the same section, we will also see how to be making the

34
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,250
production graded in the production grade.

35
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,140
While there are a few tweaks that need to be done to develop that configuration file and these are the

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,790
changes that are required when you are going to be deploying your website on a life server which your

37
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,620
end customers are going to be using.

38
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,620
So in this, we are also going to be seeing concepts such as dead code elimination, the concept of

39
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,230
shaming, if you're using some sort of old library like the equity and so on, and also CSR splitting.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,000
So these are some of the concepts that are required when you're doing the deployment and also fixing

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,220
those errors, which can be sort of tricky to solve.

42
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,090
Okay.

43
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,060
So moving forward, what we see next is building a React application with Webpack, as I told you.

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,200
Webpack is sort of the fundamental piece when you're building a single page application.

45
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,100
And in this course, I'm going to be taking the example of a React application.

46
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,510
However, please note this concept can be applied irrespective of React.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,460
You can also be using the same thing on an angular as well as on a view application, although some

48
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,400
tweaks will be required as per the framework that issues.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,040
Okay, with that done, we are going to be going to the final section and this is the most important

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,370
and the detail section and that is the micro friends.

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,180
So micro frontend is a very new concept and it's a very popular concept, especially in a bigger company.

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,320
And we are going to be seeing how do we developing a application from the micro frontend perspective.

53
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,030
We are going to be having five different applications that are going to be coordinating among each other

54
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,200
and that is going to give you a final understanding of what is micro frontend.

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,580
So in this we are going to be building a movie booking application so in which you can be thought of

56
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,650
selecting movies, seeing the details of the movies, and finally selecting your seats to do the booking.

57
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,530
So that is about it.

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,130
On what we are going to be covering on a very high level in this course, and let's dive in and explore

59
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,240
that back in detail.
