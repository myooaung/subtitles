1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.490
Let's get started and start implementing audits.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.810
Yes, in our application.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.070
Now, before we start off, I just want to make sure that we are all on the same page.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.300
We should have this current application already running and the links working as well.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.990
So for example, I'm on the main movie application and I click on any of the movie title.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.870
I'm navigated to the details page.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.040
And if I click on the book button, I'm taken up to the booking page.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.560
So this functionality should be working for you.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.480
Similarly, if I just click on any of the item and click on this book button, nothing is going to work.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
This is because we are going to be right now implementing this and parsing the data using our text years.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.330
Okay.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.990
So do not worry about that for now.

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.710
Just wanted to show what is the current state that we are in.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.880
Okay, so let's go back and see what we are going to be implementing.

15
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.190
Now, if I just open up a small diagram, I just want to give you a visual implementation before we

16
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.320
go ahead and do the code wise implementation.

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.540
So we have this movie application, and I mentioned in the article's introduction that we will have

18
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.330
something called the optics tier subject and we are also going to be having the consumers who are going

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.900
to be consuming this subject and then also can be publishing the data.

20
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.380
So the question is, where should this object be defined?

21
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.990
Now, similar to our routing example.

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240
So for example, if I just go to the routing slide, we had this react router, the main router set

23
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.890
up in the main movie application.

24
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.590
And the same thing is going to be done in the text use case as well, because our main movie application

25
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.630
is always going to be skiing up when our application is running, whereas all the internal applications

26
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.250
are going to be switched based on this out.

27
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.180
So we cannot be keeping the subject within any of the internal applications.

28
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.380
We need to be keeping it on the topmost application, which in August is the movie app.

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.110
Now we are going to be exposing this entire subject so that other consumers can be using it.

30
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.090
And that is going to be done using the pack.

31
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.760
And once the consumer, for example, this homepage has consumed this and called this subject out next

32
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.030
is going to be publishing that event and saving it in this subject.

33
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.890
And on this selection application, we are going to be having this subscribe function, which is going

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.990
to be subscribing to the same subject that we have in the movie application and retrieving all the current

35
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.790
data that is there in that subject.

36
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.520
So this is the concept that we are trying to implement.

37
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.000
And let's go back to our code base and see how this is going to work.

38
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.650
Okay.

39
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.940
I'm back in my code base.

40
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.160
Now, before we get started, if you were facing any problem with the entire setup update, now what

41
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.740
you can do is you can just copy this 11.2 folder and this is going to be the starting point for this

42
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.060
data management lecture.

43
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.850
I have already copied this and made a clone in the 11.3, and 11.3 is going to have this solution for

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.370
this data management, which we do is going to be implementing now.

45
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.540
Okay.

46
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.770
So I already have almost always running, as you can see over here, and we can just go ahead and do

47
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.580
the implementation.

48
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.810
So the first implementation is going to be to create that observable object.

49
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.740
So that is going to be created in the movie app.

50
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.140
So let's go ahead and open that.

51
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.200
Now, before I go ahead and do any of the implementation, we need to be installing that library.

52
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.950
Without that, nothing is going to really work.

53
00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.730
Okay.

54
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.330
So I just need to switch over to my console and let's switch over to our movie application that is right

55
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.570
here.

56
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.830
And in this, I'm going to be stopping this hour and see NPM install, save and say Oryx X.

57
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.740
Yes, you need to be doing this as well because I have not installed the articles in the package today,

58
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.690
so it's not going to be ready for usage.

59
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.860
Okay.

60
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.160
So once you have done the installation, you can go ahead and start this over once again.

61
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.290
So we'll see an appearance of.

62
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.270
Okay.

63
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.640
So my soul starts off, my browser opens.

64
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.260
I do not really need the browser for now.

65
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.370
Okay.

66
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.810
Now to be creating that observable, what I'm going to be doing over here is let's go ahead and create

67
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.550
probably utils file.

68
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.180
So in the RC, I just right click and or here I'm going to be saying this as movie.

69
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.850
Observable will be acr vab lg gorgeous.

70
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.880
Okay, so this is going to be the name of my file.

71
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.100
You can just give it any name as you wish.

72
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.110
So that's not really a big problem.

73
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360
And in here, we're going to be seeing import clearances from our X gas.

74
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.470
Okay they think that we are going to be importing is subject.

75
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.190
Now, I've not mentioned this earlier, but we are going to be facing a problem with this subject later

76
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.400
on.

77
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.470
And I do not really want to be telling it right now so that you learn more about it.

78
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.920
Yes.

79
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.180
So let's just proceed with the subject for now.

80
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.540
Okay.

81
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.950
So I hope that's not too demotivating, but do not worry.

82
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.330
Let's just go ahead and do the implementation.

83
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.950
It's just going to be a small change later on.

84
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.200
Okay.

85
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.350
Now we have this subject ready.

86
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.620
We need to be creating a new subject or let's call this as opposed.

87
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.250
Movie data equals two new subject.

88
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.180
All right.

89
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.500
So this object is created now.

90
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.090
We also going to be exporting this object.

91
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.600
So as export default movie data.

92
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.920
So that's pretty much the implementation for the observable.

93
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.300
So we have the observable already.

94
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.460
Now anyone can just use this approval and add some value in it and also subscribe to it.

95
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.690
Okay.

96
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.250
So let me just go ahead and save that.

97
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.860
And the next thing that we want to be doing is exposing this so that other application can start using

98
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.040
it.

99
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.630
So for that reason, I need to be going to my web back config of my movie application.

100
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.700
So let's open that up and let's go down to our module filtration plugin.

101
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.680
So let's minimize that.

102
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.360
We have this module protection right here.

103
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.390
Now you can see that we just have the remote setup.

104
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.640
We are not exposing anything yet from the movie application, so we need to be adding that expose parameter

105
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.000
as well.

106
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.620
So I'll say exposes.

107
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.080
And in this we want to be creating an object.

108
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.800
And let's expose this as dark slash movie data.

109
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.480
So I'm just going to be keeping it a little bit simple to implement instead of writing observable.

110
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:54.280
And we want to be exposing it from dart slash as RC slash movie observable.

111
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.080
Dart?

112
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.680
Yes.

113
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.440
Just make sure that the name is exact.

114
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.490
As you know, if any small mistake is there, the back is not going to really work.

115
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.870
Let's save that.

116
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.210
Let's stop our solar and let's get that thing started once again, because we have made a change in

117
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.140
the Webpack config.

118
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.500
Okay.

119
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.730
So let's just switch back.

120
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.390
So all that's required in the movie application for exposing is done.

121
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.440
Now we can be going ahead and start consuming it in one of the applications.

122
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.580
So let me just go ahead and start the implementation from our homepage application.

123
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.350
So if you remember, we have the homepage application within which we have this quick booking.

124
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.720
So when we click on that book button in the quick booking component, that's when we want to sort of

125
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.950
publish the data, right?

126
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.440
So we need it in the homepage application.

127
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.230
So in here I can just go to the web page config and add a new remote.

128
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.480
So let's check out where's our remote here.

129
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.350
So that's right here.

130
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.180
So in the remote, I can be adding a new remote here.

131
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.580
Let's call this as movie app.

132
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.050
Just like that.

133
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.400
And in here, we need to be using the name of the application.

134
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.790
So if I just come back to a movie app, it's called this right here.

135
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:14.700
So let's just copy that based right here and see added S&amp;P Double Island slash slash local host and

136
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.140
the port number that the movie app is running on is 9000.

137
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.330
So let's have that added as well.

138
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.270
Flash remote and three dot gas.

139
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.010
Okay.

140
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.910
So we are adding the new remote, which is our movie application.

141
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.190
You can just go ahead and see of that and let me just go ahead and restart my home page application

142
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.550
as well.

143
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.740
So that's right here.

144
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.920
So stop the solo and get started once again.

145
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:49.210
So, Zane, parents of all right, so our homepage application starts off now let me just switch back

146
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.750
to my.

147
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.080
Yes.

148
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.410
Good.

149
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.440
So we need to be publishing from the quick booking component, right?

150
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.120
So let's just open up this quick booking.

151
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.150
Let me just quickly make this smaller.

152
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.160
And if you scroll to the bottom, we can see the book function that's getting called.

153
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.680
So that's right here, this book movie function.

154
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.100
So let's just find this book movie function that's on top somewhere.

155
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.090
So it's right here.

156
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.600
Okay, so we already have the data ready that we need to be publishing.

157
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.920
So as you can see, we are also logging that data that needs to be published.

158
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.740
But now we need to be adding it to that observable.

159
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.650
So for that, we need to be sort of importing that function which we had exported from this movie observable

160
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.440
and then publish data to this.

161
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:28.780
Right.

162
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.180
So how do you access this particular function?

163
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.590
So far, whenever we are doing any of the inputs, they were all react components.

164
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:41.350
So for example, this typography was a react component and then we use this react got lazy and then

165
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.180
we use the suspense for loading it.

166
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.380
Now in this case, it's not a react component anymore, it's just a function.

167
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.940
So how do you how do you really use it?

168
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.620
Well, for this, we need to be using the concept of dynamic import that we learned earlier.

169
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.420
So if you remember, dynamic import is for loading all the dependencies lazily.

170
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.610
So that's exactly what we need over here.

171
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.350
If you want to take up a challenge, you can just pause the video right here and try to implement the

172
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.410
import using dynamic import and get that function called here.

173
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.870
And if not, it's also fine.

174
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.430
We are going to be implementing it right away.

175
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.590
So dynamic import is implemented like this.

176
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.660
So we're going to be saying import and then we pass in the location.

177
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.460
So what is the location of this?

178
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.980
Well, it's going to be the name of the application.

179
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.730
So we here, we have given the name in the event back file as movie app.

180
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.890
So we need to say we had as movie app slash and then the component name.

181
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.710
So it's the same concept that we used over here actually.

182
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.540
So it's the name of the application.

183
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.610
And in the case of the component that has been exported, if we just check out the Webpack config of

184
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.660
movie app, we can see that we are exporting it as movie data.

185
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.180
So that's the exact name that we need to be using over there.

186
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.220
So it's going to be movie data.

187
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.780
Okay, so the import is done.

188
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.720
Then once you have done this import, this is going to be returning a promise, not a result of promise.

189
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.250
You can say dot then and this is going to be returning something like a module.

190
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:10.960
So we can just put it as module and then you can put up our function now to get hold of the default

191
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:18.460
import that has been sent by this module, we can say const and we can put away it has movie data equals

192
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.800
to module dot default.

193
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.170
Yes, this is a little bit weird syntax, but this is how we're going to be doing the dynamic import.

194
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.160
Okay.

195
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.050
Now we have the movie data ready actually.

196
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.140
So we have this entire object that is been exported ready.

197
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.880
Now, what you can do here is you can just use the next function that is that on this.

198
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:44.170
So I can say movie data dot next and in here I can be passing whatever data I need to that particular

199
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:44.830
observable.

200
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.290
So in our case, we need to be passing this entire movie booking object so I can just put on the booking

201
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:50.670
object.

202
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.950
So I'll see booking just like that.

203
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.760
And you're pretty much done.

204
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.920
You have successfully published your movie booking into the Observable.

205
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.530
Now we're just going to be taking a short break and see how we can be subscribing to this observable

206
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.120
in this sheet booking application.
