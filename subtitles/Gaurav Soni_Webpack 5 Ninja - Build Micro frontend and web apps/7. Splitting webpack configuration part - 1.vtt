00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
Welcome to a final video on making a production grade in Webpack.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.160
So in this video, we're going to be seeing how to be splitting the configuration file into multiple

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.520
part.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
As discussed earlier, some of the configuration need to be running only when we are in the development

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.870
mode and some configuration need to run in the production mode.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.080
So let's see what kind of optimization we need to be doing here.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
I've already duplicated my previous folder, so I've created a new folder 9.4.

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.030
So this is going to be containing all the new configuration that we do from now on.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.200
Okay.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.990
So first of all, we need to be creating new additional.

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.530
So first of all, we need to be creating two additional configuration file for that pack.

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.180
So let me just right click here and call this as the PAC dot common dot gas.

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.780
It has to be at the same level as either the per configuration file.

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.820
And we are also going to be creating another configuration file.

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.960
Let's call this as the backdoored product.

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.820
Yes.

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.950
Okay.

18
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.540
So as the name suggest, we have a common JS, a project and then we also have a config.

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.930
Jess So I'm just going to be renaming this and let's make this as dot dev dot.

20
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.440
Yes.

21
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.780
So that's a development, that's a production.

22
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.300
And you can have more if you like to.

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.540
Okay.

24
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.480
So what is our strategy here?

25
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.570
What are we trying to implement?

26
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.100
So what are we going to be doing here?

27
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.920
First of all, let's go ahead and copy all the content that is there in the original back file into

28
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.940
the other two files.

29
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.400
So for example and pasting it in the comments and let's pasted in the prod as well.

30
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.880
Okay, now let's go to the common file.

31
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.460
And from this file let me remove this only related to the development or the production files.

32
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.300
So for example, let's check it out or from the start.

33
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.160
So we have the modular experts object, we have the entry and the output object.

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.320
Now, as you can see, we are going to be needing both of these objects, irrespective of the development

35
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.800
environment.

36
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.080
So we are going to be keeping this in the common file.

37
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.000
Then we have the dev server as the name suggests.

38
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.680
We just need this to be running when we are in the development mode.

39
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.780
So let's just go ahead and delete this from here.

40
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.210
Then let's move on to the next one, which is the modules which host all our loaders.

41
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.280
So this again is going to be a common specification irrespective of your environment.

42
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.260
So let's leave that as it is.

43
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.040
Then let's move on to the next one we have the provides plugin now provides generally is again used

44
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.890
both in the development as well as the production mode.

45
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.680
So in case your particular query or your moment object is not found, either of you are going to break.

46
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.630
So let's keep that in the common as well.

47
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.720
Then we have the pack configuration.

48
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.950
This is again going to be a common configuration because we want those files to be generated for us.

49
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.180
Let's move on.

50
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.340
We have the copy plugin.

51
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.070
Now, copy plugin can sort of be moved to our production environment because we are not going to be

52
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.320
copying every time they are sent to our distribution.

53
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.210
And this will sort of slow down our development process as well because every time the files need to

54
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.190
be copied to the disk, so it's going to take more time.

55
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.640
So I'm going to be opting to add this in the production model.

56
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.530
So let's grab more from the comments.

57
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.530
Next, we have the purge thesis.

58
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.510
Now, purging is also something specific to the production, so let's get rid of that as well.

59
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.570
And that's going to be added to the production.

60
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.600
Now we have the bundle analyzer plugin bundle and the plugin has, you know, it shows us all the utilization

61
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.850
of those bundles and how the bundles are created.

62
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.050
These are modules and so on.

63
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.520
So again, this is something related to development and not really used in production.

64
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.630
Let's remove that.

65
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.420
Then we have the main thesis extract plugin.

66
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.540
Now, this again is going to be running in production only.

67
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.480
Well, this is because it's slightly faster to be adding all the theaters directly into your email rather

68
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.920
than creating a separate file.

69
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.230
So I'm going to be removing that as well.

70
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.280
Okay.

71
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.990
So that looks pretty good to me.

72
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.750
We have the optimization as split chunk.

73
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.610
And finally, I'm just going to be keeping this switched on so that we have multiple chunks created.

74
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.010
And this is generally a good thing to have in the development because you want to be analyzing now and

75
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.280
then.

76
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.050
How are your chunks getting created?

77
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.320
What are the kind of dependencies that are that in chunks and so on?

78
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.570
So for that reason, I'm just going to be keeping it here.

79
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.860
One more change that I would be needing is if I go on top.

80
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.530
We have the Menzies extract plugin.

81
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.810
Now, since we have removed it from the comments, it does make sense to remove it from here as well.

82
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.840
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to be sort of removing just these two loaders from here.

83
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.120
Why am I doing this?

84
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.220
Because I'm going to be using the Minsk's extract plug in when we are in the production mode.

85
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.960
And I'm going to be using the normal style loader when I'm in the development mode.

86
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.980
So for that reason, I'm going to be removing this as well from here.

87
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.480
Okay.

88
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.710
So we are just keeping one loader common, which is the asset resource module.

89
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.760
Okay.

90
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.500
So that looks great.

91
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.820
Let me just go ahead and save this configuration.

92
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.230
So there's a part common.

93
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.020
Let's close this one now and let's move on to the next one, which is the dev dependencies.

94
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.310
Now in the dev dependencies, also, we need to be making a lot of changes.

95
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.430
So all the things that are there in common can be removed.

96
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.560
So we can remove entry and output.

97
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.980
We are going to be keeping the dev server and in the modules we are going to be removing the one that

98
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.350
was already important, which was the asset resource.

99
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.440
And in the dev, the back, instead of using the means a CCS extract plugin, I'm going to be using

100
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.640
the style loader so I can just replace that with style loader.

101
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.010
Let's replace the second one also with style loader.

102
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.410
Okay, so that looks good.

103
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.000
Now let's move on.

104
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.570
This was already added in the comments so I can remove this.

105
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.530
The pack was also added in common so we can remove this.

106
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.310
Then we have the copy plugin.

107
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.800
This is going to be added to production.

108
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.580
So remove this.

109
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.890
This is again added to production.

110
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.690
So we remove this.

111
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.240
Then we have the bundle analyzer plugin.

112
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.030
So I can sort of enable this because I want this to be running in my development mode.

113
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.420
We can get rid of the Menzies attack start as well.

114
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.360
Okay, so that looks pretty clean.

115
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.490
Now I can also remove the optimization because this is again added to the comments.

116
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.800
So let's get that also removed and let's just modify our file.

117
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.060
Okay.

118
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.680
So that looks pretty clean to me.

119
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.300
We are not using this variable anymore so we can get rid of this configuration as well.

120
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.590
And a lot of cleanup to be done in the imports as well.

121
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.530
So we need the port.

122
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.920
We do not need the original plug in, copy plug in.

123
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.880
We do need the bundle analyzer not required the M.S..

124
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.420
SS We do not really need Diva Pack Importer as well.

125
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.100
We also do not need the purge nor the glove.

126
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.430
Okay.

127
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.260
So you can see my file has become quite small and this is much more maintainable as well.

128
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.680
Let's move and do the same thing in the production.

129
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.210
So let's go up, remove all the common dependencies, the entry and the output, remove the depth so

130
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.280
as this is going to be running or line environment.

131
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.750
Now if I did notice, we are going to be keeping all of these too.

132
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:17.010
So we are going to be using the main cases extract for the Xs and Xs files and we can remove the common

133
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.930
one, which was the asset resources.

134
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.310
Okay.

135
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.070
So that looks good.

136
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.400
Now let's move on.

137
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.810
We do not need the provide plugin as it's a common dependency.

138
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.880
We do not need the stimulus.

139
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.410
Again, it's a common dependency.

140
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.990
We do need to copy BOJ and the main thesis extract.

141
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.130
Now I do not really need the bundle analyzer so I can remove that as well.

142
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.650
Let me just format this properly and we can remove the optimization section as well.

143
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.780
Okay.

144
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.340
So that looks pretty good.

145
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.620
Let's get rid of all the extra imports here.

146
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.530
So we do not need the mill, then?

147
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.990
We do not need the bundle analyzer, then we do not need the backpack imported explicitly.

148
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.960
We do need the package that is being used here.

149
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.930
And we also need the globe, which is again used by Pouch.

150
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.820
Okay, so these are all the dependencies, I think that are going to be required.

151
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.100
Okay.

152
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.130
So we have now made the changes in the common dev and the prod.

153
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.550
Now, how are we going to be running this in different environments?

154
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.020
Well, for that, what we are going to be doing is we need to make some update in our package to do

155
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.260
some.

156
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:28.240
Now, instead of having just one dev server, we are going to be having two of them.

157
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.130
And before that, just came to notice that we have a more specified rice production.

158
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.470
So we can actually also move this to a configuration.

159
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.840
Since we have two files now.

160
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:43.300
So just going back to the dev configuration, I cannot add additional attribute here in the model or

161
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.040
export called as mode.

162
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.140
And in here, we can name the mode as development for the development file.

163
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.600
The same thing can be copied.

164
00:08:53.170 --> 00:09:00.010
And if you go to the production file and go to the modular export, I can put the mode, as you guessed

165
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:00.910
it, production.

166
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.660
Okay.

167
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.270
That's done.

168
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.850
Now, if I go to the package charges and once again, I can actually be removing the mold from here,

169
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.630
and we also need to be making a change to the file itself.

170
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.750
So right now, we do not have the configuration file itself.

171
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.030
We instead have the pack dot dev dodgers.

172
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.770
That's right here.

173
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.930
Okay, so that's done.

174
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.690
We also need to make another script here.

175
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.610
So this is going to be as broad.

176
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:34.950
And in here we'll see the pack configuration and the file is going to be the backdoored product.

177
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.750
Jess.

178
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.070
Okay, so that looks good.

179
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.860
Now, one more dangerous for this.

180
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.540
Now we are going to be solving it, the development file.

181
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:49.110
So we are going to be pointing to Dev so that whenever we run Paxos, our development server starts

182
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.320
off.

183
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.770
Now I do not need the mode anymore so I can move that from here.

184
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.730
Okay.

185
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.260
So that was a lot of changes in our code.

186
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.380
So trust me, that is all the changes that we need to do for now.

187
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.730
Now, this is one small thing that we need to be doing for the now to start of the file.

188
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:10.430
We need a way of merging the common configurations into either the development or the production file.

189
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.380
So how are we going to be doing that?

190
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.580
Well, it's quite easy, but I'm going to be taking a short break because this video has been running

191
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.120
quite long.

192
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.980
So see you in the next video.
