1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,560
In this video, we're going to be figuring out how to be clicking on this book button and then navigating

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,530
to the booking page.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,350
That's the seat selection page.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,170
Now, it might look at first that things are quite simple.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,560
We are clicking on this component and we are navigating to this detail page.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,770
So same logic can be implemented on the book button as well.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,960
Well, in fact, you're not wrong.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,190
It's absolutely correct.

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,910
You can do that.

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,550
But let me show you what is the challenge that you're going to be facing.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,540
So let me just switch over to my V as Gordon.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,190
I made up a small diagram here.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,400
Now, in the case of the homepage, the homepage had all the components at the main level.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,750
So this was where we had all those movie cards, and we'll just click on that.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,150
And we had a callback function which used to be passed back to our main application, and that's how

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,110
we are doing the routing.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,850
So things were quite straightforward.

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,900
We just had like one callback function and that's how everything worked, right?

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,900
Now in the case of quick booking, quick booking is a separate component altogether, and this component

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,370
lives within the homepage, and the homepage is embedded in the main application.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,890
So we're getting deeper down into the component hierarchy.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,080
Now, in the case of two levels, we can sort of do an implementation using callback where the quick

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,730
booking is going to be passing a callback to our homepage and the homepage is going to be passing a

24
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,560
callback to our main application.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,850
But just imagine if you have four or five levels, this is not a very practical approach.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,620
So I'm going to be showing you a different approach to do this, and that is using the React context.

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,380
So this implementation more from a React perspective.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,850
So if you guys are not really interested in reacting, can just follow along and do the implementation

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,400
and you might learn something new.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,750
So those who have already used this context API, it's going to be quite straightforward.

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,820
So let's see how this can be implemented.

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,640
So let me just switch back to my code base.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,460
And in this we are making a couple of changes now when we're doing the navigation, you can see that

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,470
I need this history object so this history object should be present in my homepage.

35
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,410
So that's right here, right now we're not passing anything.

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,260
So what I'm going to do over here is I'm going to be passing in a new object here or new parameter here,

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,660
and I'm going to be calling this as a routing.

38
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,810
So don't make any changes here because this is what the perimeter of this home page application is expecting.

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,730
Now that's already been coordinated there.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,080
So in this, we are going to be having to calibrate it because I'm going to be passing in two objects.

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,740
So first one is going to be the history and then the location.

42
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,470
So what I can do over here is within curly braces.

43
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,680
I can say history, comma, location.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,720
So that's pretty much it.

45
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm going to be passing both of this because in future, let's suppose you want to be using the location

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,870
to read something from the you are.

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,100
You can do that as well.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,420
Now one general question might be coming in your mind is here, why can't I just implement this a.k.a

49
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,290
outer dom in that application since that is also react application, right?

50
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,600
Well, you're sort of right, you can do that.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,820
But this is not going to really work because the application that is maintaining the instance of your

52
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,590
routing is the main application.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,290
So this same instance or the same object has to be passed down further to the other application so that

54
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,060
they can use the same object for reference.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,000
So whenever you initialize it like this, a new instance is created and if you try to do the navigation

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,790
using a new ID instance, it's not going to work as expected.

57
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,570
So that's the reason we are passing in the same instance as a property.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,010
Okay.

59
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,120
So with that said, let's just come back here.

60
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,660
So we have posted outing attribute along with the history and location.

61
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,410
Let's just save that and move over to our homepage.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,580
So let me close this off and open up my homepage application.

63
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,710
So let me close those details up.

64
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,810
We don't need that for now.

65
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,540
And iMovie app lets us open up the home page app.

66
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,650
Okay.

67
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,910
Now how the context API works is we need to be creating a context for us.

68
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,830
So for that, I'm just going to be creating a new folder and in that I'm maintaining the context.

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,650
So let's call that folder as utils and index the returns folder.

70
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,450
I'm going to be calling this as a routing provider dot gas.

71
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,030
Okay.

72
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,410
So in this, we are going to be importing react from React.

73
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,620
And in this, we are going to be creating a context as a concept.

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,800
History.

75
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,480
Context equals to react, not create context.

76
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,110
And in this we want to be passing a default value as null.

77
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,890
And I'm also going to be exporting it as our default.

78
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,550
So as the export default history context.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,430
So this is how you generally create a context which is going to be used by the consumer as well as provider

80
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,960
of the context API.

81
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,220
Now if this all seems new to you and you've not really worked with React, do not really worry about

82
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,410
that and just follow along.

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,310
This has nothing to do with Webpack specifically is just reacting.

84
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,480
Okay, so with that done, so let's go ahead and provide this context.

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,930
So I'm going to be opening up my components within this.

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,450
We have the home component and in this home content, our gsx, we are going to be providing this.

87
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,590
So what I'm trying to do here is I'm going to be creating a context.

88
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,040
So in here I need to be first importing the context.

89
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,800
So I'll say context, history, context equals to import.

90
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,510
And then we had just created the context that's in the utils folder.

91
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,940
So utils slash routing provider, actually, let me just go ahead and rename this.

92
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,500
So instead of history, it's going to be the routing context.

93
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,650
That sounds more appropriate.

94
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,870
And then I have to use this context.

95
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,270
So basically what we're doing over here and why are we doing specifically in the home content or desks,

96
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,360
is because this is the main page that was exported from this application and used in our main movie

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,020
application.

98
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,300
So that's where we need to be providing it.

99
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,820
And you'll see the property or here the props.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,040
This is the place where we're going to be getting this routing object that we had provided from our

101
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,940
movie application.

102
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,560
So if you see prop start routing, we are going to be getting both the location as well as the history

103
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,040
object.

104
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay.

105
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,090
So with that said, let me just go down.

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,550
So this is where our gsx is being rendered in the return part.

107
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,530
And I'm going to be providing the context here.

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,430
So instead of added to it, probably I'll provide it inside this.

109
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,330
So I'll say routing context dot provider.

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,050
And just closed us and we're going to be closing this year as well.

111
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,120
We also need to be passing the value that we received in the prop.

112
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:31,580
So I'll put up over here as value equals two as prop start routing.

113
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,130
So that's going to be the routing provider.

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,230
Okay.

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,960
So let's just see.

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,680
Save this quickly.

117
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,730
Anything seems to be feeling.

118
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,770
So let me just validate quickly what's happening here in here.

119
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,390
If I just check out my imports, this is the problem.

120
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,870
So instead of saying, Konst, I should have just done import routing context from this location.

121
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,990
So my bad in case you noticed it.

122
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,520
Great.

123
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,220
Let's see if that and see if things are working properly now.

124
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,670
So if I just give this a refresh, then go to the details page.

125
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,320
So thing seems to be working now.

126
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,870
Okay, so we got the provider setup.

127
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,400
The next thing is the consumer.

128
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,410
So just switching back to our diagram.

129
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,810
So from the context we were able to provide now at the quick booking level, we are going to be consuming

130
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,400
the context that we had just provided.

131
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,560
So I'm just going to be doing that.

132
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,170
So if I go to the quick booking application and in this we need to be first importing the context.

133
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,290
So I'll say import, then let's call this the routing context.

134
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,800
From dada slash, dada slash, then utils slash routing provider.

135
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,570
So we got the context in here.

136
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,010
Now we're going to be ordering the consumer.

137
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:52,220
So we'll say routing context, dot consumer and just encapsulate your entire code block with this consumer.

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,870
So that's right.

139
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,230
Yeah.

140
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,480
Okay, so that looks good.

141
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,610
We got our consumer set up now.

142
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,310
As soon as we encapsulate all of this into a consumer, we are going to be having access to that routing

143
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,760
object.

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,680
So we need that routing object where so we need to be part passing in the context here.

145
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,220
So how do we pass a context is basically using function block.

146
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,800
So in here we need to be putting the calibrator and define a function just like that and we need to

147
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,320
be returning this entire gsx order.

148
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,090
So what we'll see is we'll have those rounded brackets and move all this div within that section.

149
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,800
So right here.

150
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,990
Okay, so if this is looking confusing, if you're using React for the first time, I'm sorry about

151
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,600
that, but this is how it works and this is the way that I wanted to implement it in in order to avoid

152
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
those multiple callbacks.

153
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,160
So we got the consumer, then we have this open braces, then we have this open and close rounded braces.

154
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,710
Define a function and returning a gsx.

155
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,320
That's why we have the ground brackets now in here.

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,200
We are going to be getting the context as a parameter.

157
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,220
So this is provided from this one right here, and this context needs to be sent to this on click function.

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
So we'll pass it over here saying.

159
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,500
Context.

160
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,160
All right.

161
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,000
So that looks good.

162
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,940
Let me just go ahead and see if this one now and if I just and if I just go to the implementation of

163
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,340
book movie, we can see that as soon as we click on book movie, we are going to be canceling log the

164
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,510
entire booking object.

165
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,690
So let's just go ahead and see if things are working as expected.

166
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,090
So I'm just going back to my browser.

167
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,250
Let's go back to our homepage from the start and let's just give this refresh.

168
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,500
And in here, if I just click on the book button, let me first clear the console and then click right

169
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,770
here.

170
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,090
We, in fact, see that the movie is number one along with the date.

171
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,330
And if I am selected in case I go ahead and change this and try to click on book again.

172
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,130
We can see that the movie, it has changed and the date and time remains the same.

173
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,830
So we got our booking thing to work.

174
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,910
Now the only thing that we need to be doing is navigating to the new place.

175
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
So what I can do over here is just going back to the code.

176
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,950
I can use this context that we had provided as a parameter so I can see context.

177
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,690
And in here, I can see context dot history.

178
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,640
Don't push and inhale.

179
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,490
We need to be pushing the booking base.

180
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,640
I'll just say book.

181
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,080
All right, so that's done.

182
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,750
Let's just save this and see if things are working.

183
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,070
So I'm coming back to my browser, and then I'm going to click on the book page.

184
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,800
And in fact, we are taken to the booking page.

185
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,770
Now we know it seems really, really complicated, but this is the sort of little bit complexity that

186
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,960
comes in when you are working with the micro frontend.

187
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,970
You need to keep track of the instances of the objects and also see that you know when you need to be

188
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,270
initializing new objects, they need to be using the same objects.

189
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,790
So these are this small complexity that do come in with the micro frontend, but it also brings in a

190
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,610
lot of benefits.

191
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,140
Okay, so I assume we need a short break.

192
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,890
This is a very long video, so let's take a short break and then we are going to be continuing on and

193
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,470
announcing our application for the.
