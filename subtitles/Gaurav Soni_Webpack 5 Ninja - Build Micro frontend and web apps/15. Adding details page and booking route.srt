1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,710
Similar to a homepage wrote, We are going to be setting up the trout for also the seed booking page

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,790
and the details page.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,020
So for that, I also need to be making some changes in both of those applications.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,030
So you can just do it along with me.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,540
Or if you want to be pausing this video in practice along, you can do that as well.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,830
Okay.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,460
So I'm just going to be making the changes in the details page app first.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,700
So I just go to the back configuration in here and let's go to the plugins.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,680
And in this, you see that there's no plugin for by the Model Federation.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,480
So let's just go ahead and add that quickly.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,960
I would say content calibrations because to require.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,600
And in here you'll see the Webpack dart container.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,920
Now, this is sort of repetitive tasks, but we have to be doing it.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,550
So as say module progression, plug in and go ahead and do the implementation.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,330
So in the plug in section as a new module filtration plug in and set up the configurations.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,350
So as usual, this is going to be having the object name.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,180
And in here we'll see.

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,150
Details.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,540
So that's going to be the name of our details application.

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,620
So in, say, file name as remote and tree dot.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,240
And then we also have the exposes object in which you are going to be exposing the details.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,390
So I'll just say it as details page.

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,090
And then location of this page is going to be slash.

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,360
That's our key component.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,420
And in this let me just verify the name quickly.

27
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,910
That's detailed.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,720
Content.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,890
Details.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,380
Content slash.

31
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,790
Details.

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,250
Content dot gsx.

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,690
Okay.

34
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,370
So we have done this configuration.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,920
Now our application is not going to work because of that bootstrapping as you are in the last video.

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,310
So we can quickly go and create those bootstrap files as well.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,720
So I'll just go ahead and create a new file in as I see folder calling it as bootstrap, not Jess and

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,490
move all the logic from indexed ideas into bootstrap dodgers and import this bootstrap file right here.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,490
So just like that.

40
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,210
Okay, so that's done.

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,250
I can just quickly restart my soul of details page application.

42
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,900
So let me just find that.

43
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,660
Stop the solo and see and run.

44
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,160
So once again.

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,480
Okay.

46
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,410
Our application has started of the things are not displaying completely but us.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,470
That's okay for now.

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,180
So the same thing also needs to be done for the seed selection application.

49
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,500
So I can just close this off or not open up my seed selection application, go to my CRC.

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,630
So first we can probably create those files.

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,980
So in ACL, call this as bootstrap dot.

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:57,100
Just move all this index dodgers configurations into bootstrap and import this bootstrap right here.

53
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,290
Alright, so that's done.

54
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,920
Final thing is making changes in our config.

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,530
So I'm just going to be doing this quickly and you can just follow along with me.

56
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,320
Okay.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,050
So we got our module filtration plugin initialized and imported in the plugin section.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,110
So as a module filtration plug in.

59
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,510
And then the name as let's call this as seed selection.

60
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,700
So just know that I'm keeping everything in lowercase.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,770
So I just like to keep it like that when I'm doing the naming convention for the Moral Foundation.

62
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,140
If you want, you can change it as well.

63
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,490
Then second is the file name as as usual remote entry.

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,100
Dodgers.

65
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,850
And finally, the exposes object.

66
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,620
So I'm going to be exposing this as seat selection.

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,760
And then this is going to be in the SRT folder component.

68
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,590
Flash.

69
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,660
Seat selection content.

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,700
So I'm just going to copy this name from here so that I don't make any mistake as switch.

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,940
So I'll just copy that name and paste it here.

72
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,910
Let's do the same thing for the G6 file as well.

73
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,560
I'll copy the name from G6 and paste it right here.

74
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,060
Okay.

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,060
So both our exposes property has been set up.

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,530
I can just save this file.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,980
Now, before I forget, I also need to be adding that shared property.

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,660
Otherwise application is not going to work.

79
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,170
And when we are trying to import it and don't mean application, we are going to be getting the same

80
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,930
error that react as being initialized multiple times.

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,490
So let me just add this shared property and in this field I'm sharing both react as well as react.

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,980
Dom I actually forgot to do do this in the details page application as well.

83
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,330
So let me just go to my details page and GoDaddy Webpack config.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,200
And in here also we need to be adding this shared property.

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,510
Okay.

86
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,930
So let's restart both of this application, the seed selection as well as the application.

87
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,730
Those top two so started once again and parents of.

88
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,890
Okay.

89
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,560
So our video speed application is working fine.

90
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,290
Let's do the same thing for the seat selection as well.

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,070
So stop this huge selection server and start it once again.

92
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,820
Okay so I seed selection application is also running now for the final changes we need to do is we just

93
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,250
need to be importing this into a main application.

94
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,490
So let me just get rid of all this open tab so that we don't get confused closing all of this unused

95
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,280
directories and open up our movie application.

96
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,990
So in the movie application, we need to be first importing all the external applications.

97
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,090
So we enter the module federation plugin.

98
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,930
So we just have one remote for now the homepage, so we can add the additional remote here.

99
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,510
So let's call the other remote as let's see.

100
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,100
Details page.

101
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,620
And this is going to be coming from one location.

102
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,970
And then we have the seed selections, I would say seed selection.

103
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,890
And this is going to be coming from one of the place now just to verify the names, I'm going to be

104
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,700
opening up the of a pack files for details application.

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,730
So in this the name is given as details and this is running on port 3001.

106
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:30,090
So let me just base this or here acted it as GDP local host and this is running on port.

107
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,980
3001 remote.

108
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,920
And three dot G's.

109
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,860
The same thing can be done for seed selection as well.

110
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,850
So let me just probably copy all of this and be strictly and make the changes.

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,970
So in the case of seed selection, our application name can be got from the back.

112
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,350
So let's select this from here and paste it right here.

113
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,910
And the port number also need to be verified.

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,960
So that's running on port 3003.

115
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,790
So let me put that here.

116
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,220
And the remote entry file limits them.

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,720
All right.

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,120
So that was a lot of configuration update in many applications, but does I hope you really understand

119
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,700
the concept of importing and exporting the modules?

120
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,450
And then how do we setting up the remote and how do we exposing the components?

121
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,100
And once we get a hang of it, it's quite straightforward and sort of repetitive task.

122
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,800
Okay, so we have all this stuff set up.

123
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,720
The final thing that we need to be doing is we need to be going to the movie application and within

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,690
that we need to go to the app charges and set up the routing.

125
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,210
So similar to this homepage application, we just need to be importing the other two also in the same

126
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,630
format.

127
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,550
So let me just make multiple copy of this and call this as detail speech.

128
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,050
And let's call the last one as.

129
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,590
Seat.

130
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,070
Selection pitch.

131
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,850
Okay.

132
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,470
We need to be importing both of them, so I'll just probably have this side by side so I don't have

133
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,180
to switch every time.

134
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,990
So in the case of the page, we are going to be using this key or here and put it over here.

135
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,730
That's how it works.

136
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,110
And then the component name is going to be received from the of a back file of this and it is a remote.

137
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,630
So we can just open the backfill.

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
So that's right here.

139
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,130
So there's this desperate application about backfill.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,600
So in the backfill, if you just go down to the plugins and we see this is been exposed with the name

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,500
called Detail Space.

142
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,460
So I'll just copy that.

143
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,160
Make sure that you copy all of this instead of just typing down because even one later over here, maybe

144
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,480
the capitalization is going to spoil your entire application is going to be really difficult to debug.

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,490
As you know, what really happened wrong.

146
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,650
So my advice is to really go ahead and copy all of this names instead of typing it down.

147
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,920
Okay.

148
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,090
So we have got the details.

149
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,650
Space now is the seed selection.

150
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,580
So we copy this parameter from here.

151
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:03,030
The key value from the movie applications, Webpack based it or here and then the component name can

152
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,740
be received from the the backfill.

153
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,530
So in this case we go to the seed selection.

154
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,040
Open the back config.

155
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,110
And in this we have exposed it with the name as seed selection.

156
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,240
So let's close that and paste it right here.

157
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:21,720
Okay.

158
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,490
So let me just bring everything here so that, you know, we have enough space and we can see what's

159
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:26,880
happening.

160
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:32,700
So we just imported all the three component pieces over here, as you can see, from different locations.

161
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,590
Now we just need to be using them.

162
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,290
So what I can do here is I can sort of remove this booking page with three had earlier the dummy out.

163
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,070
And in this case, I'm just going to be copying and pasting the suspense part or here and instead of

164
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,900
the homepage, we need to be loading the, as you guessed it, the booking page.

165
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,550
So now kids booking page is part of this heap selections and this is the selection page.

166
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,400
The same thing can also be done in the case of detail space.

167
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,170
So remove all of that, put the suspense block here and instead of the home page, we are going to be

168
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,760
loading the details page so that details page.

169
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,500
Okay.

170
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,960
So that was a lot of configuration update.

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,310
Right.

172
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,540
And I hope you are able to follow along because this is a lot of repetitive task.

173
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,410
We are not adding anything new as such is just the normal exporting and the importing of components.

174
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,970
Okay, so once that all is done, so I'm just going to restarting starting my movie application.

175
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,450
So because we had added this, remote standards aren't going to be found immediately.

176
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,840
So let's find our movie applications on that right here.

177
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,370
Stop the server and started off once again.

178
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,080
So NPM runs off.

179
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:44,900
Okay.

180
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,130
So just give me a read that the identified media space has already been declared.

181
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,440
So let us go back and see what else the mistake we did.

182
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:52,940
Okay.

183
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,230
So I can see that I already have this three dummy applications that we're importing earlier so I can

184
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,930
actually get rid of all this imports that we're using earlier.

185
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,710
And we need to be pulling up all the pages dynamically this time.

186
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,770
So we just need to be keeping these components alive.

187
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,180
So let's just save that and let's see if things are working as expected now.

188
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,850
And congratulations, you got your first micro frontend application working including the routing.

189
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,130
So for example, we are on the router out now.

190
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,910
If I just hit slash details, we get the details page.

191
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,780
So that's excellent.

192
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,840
And similarly, if I just go to the booking page, so I see slash book and we get the booking page and

193
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,540
the booking component of the seed selection component loaded here.

194
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,760
So our entire application is looking, using routing and that that's a really good achievement.

195
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,890
Now we're going to be taking things further and see how we can click on components and do the routing

196
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,590
and what are the kind of challenges that we're going to be facing over the.

197
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,370
And one more thing.

198
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,230
If you get stuck in any of the part and I know it's quite easy to get stuck because you might be having

199
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,580
some name convention issues or maybe some copying pasting was not done properly.

200
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,890
So in that case, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to be copying the entire project up till now

201
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,770
where all the navigation is working into a new folder.

202
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,900
And I'm going to be starting off in a fresh folder in the next video, so you can just copy along all

203
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,630
this 11.1 folder, all the things that are there in this 11.1 folder and get your application started

204
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,400
and follow along in the next video.

205
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,900
So that's it for now.

206
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,190
See you in the next one.
