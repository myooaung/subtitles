1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,160
We're going to be starting a brand new section.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,440
I'm really excited to present this project to you.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,090
We're going to be using all the knowledge that we have used so far on how to be loading external files,

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,970
how to be using the plug ins, and going to be applying to a real project.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,040
We are going to be taking the case of a legacy application that was running without any backpack or

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,710
without any tools, and we're going to be optimizing it to use Webpack and get the all the modern things

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,910
running in that website.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,100
We are going to be encountering plugins which are directly imported in the mail files and see how are

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,290
we moving those into the JavaScript and how do we setting up our back configuration to make the development

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,070
very easy?

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,740
So what are the things going to be covered in this section?

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,210
Well, we are going to be seeing how are we doing the import of the JavaScript and the thesis.

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,470
So this is something that we had gone through briefly in our previous sections.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,300
We are also going to be seeing how to be refactoring our entire website so that is more that back friendly

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,120
and easier to deploy in a real production environment.

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,150
Similarly, we'll also see how are we moving the assets?

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,620
So right now we don't have Albert fold already for doing the deployment on a real so.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,570
So after moving the assets into the build folder, we are going to be actually able to just pick up

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,030
the very folder and put it on any static web server and the website should function as expected.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,280
So that is going to be a very big win for us.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,060
Similarly, we are just going to be seeing how we are managing multiple dependencies.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,430
So dependency management was also seen briefly here, but there are a lot of dependencies that we're

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,800
going to be having already added to human file.

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,290
We'll see how removing those dependencies into our JavaScript and also between different pages.

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,300
So that's what's in this project.

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,920
So it's going to be combining all our knowledge so far and putting it all together in a single website.

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,660
Okay, so I'm really excited.

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's move on and see what this project is all about.
