00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,200
You guys.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,800
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,560
And let's continue our journey to become a vet back ninja.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,680
So to become a ninja, we need to be first doing some basic stuff.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,100
So that starts with installing few of the softwares on our computer.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,020
So let's go ahead and do that.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,300
The first after that we'll be needing is get some what are we navigating to the get website?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,230
So if you just search for get on Google, we can see that we navigated to this.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,250
I get ACM dotcom so you can just open this up, go for the download version and you can download it

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,970
specific to your operating system.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,270
I already have this downloaded, so I'm just going to be skipping this.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,810
The second important thing that you're going to be needing is Node.js.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,780
So once you have Node.js website open up, you'll be prompted to download again for your appropriate

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,930
operating system, and you can go ahead and install this as well.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,840
Make sure using the latest version of Node.js, because some of the features that are required for the

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,180
pack is supported only by the latest version.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,760
So once you have both of these things downloaded, let's go and verify that all the things are been

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,490
downloaded properly and installed properly on our system.

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,700
So for that, I'm just going to be opening up terminal.

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,350
If you're on a Windows operating system, you can open your PowerShell or your CMT.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,370
And in this, I'm just going to be checking the version of the installed node.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,320
So I'll say node dash.

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,830
And as you can see, I have the Norwegian 14 running all the latest one and 16, but it's not really

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,690
necessary to upgrade to 16 for now.

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,130
All right.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,030
You can also check the NPR questions by typing in and PM Dash and I have the version 7.16 running,

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
so that's pretty good.

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,730
And the last one is get version.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,210
So let's get Wuzhen, I suppose.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,130
Yes, that's right.

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,820
And I already have ghettoization of 2.32 installed.

32
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,140
So that looks pretty good.

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,370
All right.

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,200
So that is pretty much what we need.

35
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,490
Now, the additional thing that you will be needing when you're doing a development is via code.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,740
I strongly recommend to use V is.

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,870
So we can go to the V as code website and we have this code dot Visual Studio dot com and you can install

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,550
this for your computer as well.

39
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,250
Now, it's not a required specification to continue on with this course, but you can use whatever you're

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,740
comfortable with when you're doing the development or actually that is pretty much just what is required

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,300
to be installed on our system.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,450
Let's continue on in the next video and write some code.
