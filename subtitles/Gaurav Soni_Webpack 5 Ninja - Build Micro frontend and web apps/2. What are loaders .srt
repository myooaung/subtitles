00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,540
You guys.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,170
Welcome back.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,100
In this video, we are going to be seeing what exactly is the concept of loaders?

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,540
You know, this is one of the biggest concept in Webpack and this is really important whenever are going

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,190
to be riding your backpack configuration.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,440
So before that, let's have a look at the dependency graph.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,710
This is the graph that we had seen earlier as well and show exactly how the Webpack file works behind

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,070
the scene.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,280
Now, we have already seen this and we saw that when we read on our web back, build a few files, outputted.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,870
We had the bundled ideas.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,310
We did not really have a separate thesis and develop our cases, but we're going to be seeing that later

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,550
on.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,460
Then we saw that we were using this bundled ideas file in the next RHD and then our application was

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,870
working well.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,440
There's an addition here.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,270
Now, if I have created another diagram here, so let's see exactly where Loader fits in.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Now in this let's take the example of this mean dodgers in this year was important additional dependencies

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
of the SS and an image.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,500
So as you can see we have written import style from index start the SS and import logo from the assets

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,180
folder and the logo dot PNG.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,850
Now there's one fundamental concept here.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,070
The pack does not really know how to be dealing with files other than JavaScript, so we need to be

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,500
teaching the pack exactly how to be loading these other types of files, and that is exactly where loaders

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,940
come in, as the name suggests.

25
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,500
So what happens here?

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,830
Well, again, the web page goes through all our files here, and then when comes doing the index studies,

27
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,700
it sees that, well, okay, there's a thesis file that needs to be loaded.

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,650
And how do I load that file?

29
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,050
Well, that configuration is written in the web back file, and that is exactly how it works.

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,850
So we need to be defining different loaders for each and every file types that we need.

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,830
So, for example, if you're using the access file type, you need to be having a couple of things as

32
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,450
loaders, which are going to be seen shortly.

33
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,690
And similarly, if you're using some thesis pre processes maybe as the or less, then you need to be

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,760
having those appropriate loaders in place.

35
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,460
Those are going to be getting an error that does not understand how to be loading these files.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,440
Similar thing is going to be done for the images as well.

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,810
So if you want to be loading any sort of images in your JavaScript, you need to be having those image

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,830
loaders in place.

39
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,650
Now, if you explore on the backside itself, I want to make you familiar with the documentation as

40
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,930
well so that you do not really have to depend just on this course, but you can always refer the official

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,890
documentation and that is going to be very helpful when you're doing the real development.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,160
So let's head over to the Webpack concept.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,520
So the website is about Baghdad security.

44
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,490
And in this we have this section on top.

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,950
So as you can see, these are the concept configuration guide loaders migrate and plug in.

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,020
So right now we are looking at the loader section.

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,600
So if you go to the loaders, it gives you a brief introduction of exactly what are loaders and so on

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,250
this you do not really have to worry about.

49
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,940
We're going to be seeing all of this in this course, but there are different file types.

50
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,390
So you can see here these are all the loaders that are available.

51
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,390
You got like your Babel loader, you have coffee script loaders, then you have like loaders, node

52
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,750
loaders, then you've got some specific things as loaders.

53
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,010
So we are going to be seeing a couple of the cases loaders in this particular schools.

54
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,670
So we have this uses less loader than we have your SPSS or SPSS loaders and so on.

55
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,280
But just go through this documentation.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,680
As you can see, there are a lot of loaders that are available.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,370
You can also load files, you can load your Jason and so on.

58
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,470
So if you have maybe some configurations in your Jason file, you can be loading those as well directly

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,650
in JavaScript and all these configurations need to be done.

60
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,450
Now when you're going through any loader you can just for example, click on the loader itself and it

61
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,280
will exactly tell you how to be using it.

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,460
So you can see the recommended usage is listed here.

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,630
Now don't really worry about this right now we are going to be seeing how this is working behind the

64
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,020
scenes.

65
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,860
Going back to our Webpack.

66
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,910
Now, as soon as our loader kicks in, it's going to be loading those files and then it's going to be

67
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,110
creating those bundles.

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,850
Now, please note that you can also have multiple loaders for a single file type, and we're going to

69
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,810
be seeing that shortly.

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,510
So, for example, for us, we are just going to be using the access loader that we saw in the documentations

71
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,020
of example.

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,310
Let me just go back.

73
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,290
So we had this use as a lawyer.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,030
So we are going to be using a combination of things as lot of we are going to be using C loader as well

75
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,160
as you are s6's loaders.

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,950
And we are also going to be using another one called style loader.

77
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:35,210
So we are going to be using all of this in conjunction not just one single loader and that's about it.

78
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,410
So once you have those loaders in place, you're going to be having the same bundle created and then

79
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,290
you're going to be using them in your main indexed file.

80
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,280
All right.

81
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
So that was all about the theory.

82
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,860
Let's go ahead and write some code and really understand exactly how loaders work.
