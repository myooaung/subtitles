00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.960
Hey, guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.120
In the last, you got our websites out of working, but there were a couple of issues here.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.240
First of all, the banner image was not loading.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.280
And if I go to the course's pages, we can see that the page was breaking as well.

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.980
Now, let's try to figure out what exactly is the problem.

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.010
So videos right click on the banner image to inspect.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.860
And if I go to the network tab, hit refresh.

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.890
Once again, we can see that we're trying to load this banner image RPG file, and this is the exact

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.420
part where we are trying to load it from.

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.430
So we have this a website which is running on local or state one in this case, and then we have the

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.380
asset folder within which we have the banner image dropping.

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.690
Now if I go back to my code that's right here and if you check out our project folder, we do not really

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.570
have a disk folder right now because I had to clean that up.

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.990
And if I run NPM so directly without running and being brand dev, it's going to be just outputting

15
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.740
it directly on the browser and sort of maintaining the disk folder in memory.

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.140
So that's why we did not see the disk folder here.

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.990
So for that, what you can do is you can just control C to stop the dev solo and then we can just clear

18
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.360
the control off and see NPM run dev so that we are able to see what's happening within the folder.

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.300
Okay, now we have the folder here.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.210
Now we see that we do not have any folder called assets and that's why we are not able to see that image

21
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.400
and either the image is present or here.

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.900
So that's one of the problems.

23
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.370
Now if you go back to the browser, click on courses and check out the course.

24
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.170
Start estimable the courses.

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.800
DoorDash HTML was supposed to be in this pages folder and it's not.

26
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.140
So if we go back, it's actually present in the root location and that's why it's not able to locate

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.460
that particular file.

28
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.610
Now, one hack to fix this is you can just go ahead, create a new folder called us as pages.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.160
And then if I move this courses start has to implement did I do it on my dev server once again.

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.930
So say npm, run, serve, let's just wait for it to start off.

31
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.400
Okay.

32
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.460
We do not really still fix our image, but if I go to the courses page, we actually see that the courses

33
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
page is sort of loading and obviously this has happened.

34
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.810
This is not the right way of doing it.

35
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.090
So what is the problem?

36
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.230
So how do we fix it?

37
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.940
We know what is the problem.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.370
So to fix it, we need to basically have a mechanism in which all our references do not break.

39
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.800
So what I mean by references is if I go to my index, start to estimate additional code, not in the

40
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.070
test folder, and if I check on the banner image over here.

41
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.100
So that was the banner image drop.

42
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.460
And your idea is being loaded directly within the email.

43
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.260
And when you load it directly in the email, it's looking at the local reference that is there in your

44
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.280
source directory.

45
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.940
So for fixing this, the ways is one of the reasons you can directly import this file in your JavaScript,

46
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.960
and if you do that, it's automatically going to copy it in the test folder.

47
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.350
So just to quickly show that how it works, I'm just going to be removing this SRT for now and just

48
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.430
give it a MIDI.

49
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.860
Let's call this as banner image.

50
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.570
Okay.

51
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.950
And what we'll do next is go to our index, Sturgis, and just pick up that element.

52
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.250
So I would say concept.

53
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.210
Banner element equals to dollar.

54
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.410
And now you can see that we're using the equator here so it can just make things a little bit quicker.

55
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.090
So it's a banner image and then the first element.

56
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.410
Okay, so we have the banner element.

57
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.510
Now, we also need to be importing the image.

58
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.040
So you can just come on top and say, import.

59
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.100
Bender from Dart Slash asserts and within the assets folder I have this banner dash image Benji.

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.610
So say banner dash image and art benji.

61
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.050
Okay, we have the banner image loaded in our JavaScript.

62
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.380
Now we can just go down and then replace the source for it.

63
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.030
So banner element export as I see.

64
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.910
It goes to the better.

65
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.980
Okay, so that's pretty much it.

66
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.600
Now, as soon as I see of the file, you can see that, you know, my Webpack is not able to identify

67
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.750
it.

68
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.280
Now, we have already seen this a couple of times.

69
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.140
Well, this is because it's not able to load that particular asset, which is of image type.

70
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.390
So we can just do a quick configuration change in other files so that it understands the image being

71
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.750
loaded.

72
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.450
So in my Webpack file, I just copy the modules and add another property here.

73
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.750
And this is going to be testing for all the image types.

74
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.260
So we can just replace this and put in the images that are PND, jpeg, jpg and gif or.

75
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.330
However you would like to call it.

76
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.150
And then we also need to be changing the loaders.

77
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.390
So in the loaders we just put in the built in loader and that we do by seeing type.

78
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.860
Asset slash resource.

79
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.010
Okay.

80
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.040
So that's it.

81
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.080
Just save this and just quit our pack and just try to run it once again.

82
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.600
So just remember that whenever you're making any changes to the Webpack config file itself, you have

83
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.740
to stop the pack now.

84
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.100
So it's not going to be picking up all the configuration changes that you do, indeed, the leftover

85
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.020
file itself.

86
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.920
Okay.

87
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.590
So after doing that, we can see our so I started the browser opened up and the image was actually loaded.

88
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.900
Now if I go back to my V is good and there's not going to be any change in our test folder as of now.

89
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.670
But if I just control C and say NPM run dev to see what the updated best folder looks like.

90
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.820
Just give it a second.

91
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.780
And we have the updated folder.

92
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.260
And this time you can see that the image was copied here as well.

93
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.960
So we have the image property added here.

94
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.700
So that looks pretty good.

95
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.140
Things are working pretty well.

96
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.610
But there's still one issue.

97
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.180
What if I just want to be using this image directly in my image?

98
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.480
So instead of adding it in my JavaScript and then loading it or the well, in that case, what do you

99
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.320
need to be doing this?

100
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.840
We need to be sort of copying all the files that are here in the same structure and pasting it in our

101
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.530
test folder.

102
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.450
So how do we do that?

103
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.550
Well, that's going to be very easy using one of the other plugins that we have available and let's

104
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.170
see how we can be doing it using that.

105
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.670
So what are we going to be doing now is I'm going to be sort of removing it from here.

106
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.510
So just remove all the things that we've done.

107
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.930
I'm just going to be leaving it as a comment in case you need it further.

108
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.410
And I'm going to be removing the import as well.

109
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.030
So let's comment that out as well.

110
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.530
Going back to our index start estimate.

111
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.300
I'm going to be adding source over here as well.

112
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.770
So we'll say sources, dart slash a third banner image.

113
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.160
Okay.

114
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.250
So this is back like before and things will not work again.

115
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.400
Okay.

116
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.040
Now for copying it from the SC folder to our dist folder.

117
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.300
What are we going to be doing this?

118
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.160
We're going to be installing a new plug in.

119
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.200
And since this video is running quite long, let's take a short break and install the new plug in and

120
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.100
see what are the modifications that we need to be doing to develop that file as well.
