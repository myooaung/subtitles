00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,210
Hey, guys, welcome to a brand new section.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,150
And this section is all going to be about optimization.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,710
We have covered the basics in the previous section, and now it's time to take our baby to the next

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,070
level.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,020
So far we have just seen how we are creating the bundles, but we're not really seen what's going inside

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,550
the bundles and how do we really optimizing and using the true potential of that fact.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,130
So what are we going to be covering in this section?

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,930
Well, first of all, we are going to be analyzing the build that we created in the last project.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,850
So all this, what are you going to be doing?

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,610
Optimization is going to be on top of the last project.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
So once we analyzed the build, we are going to be figuring out that there are a couple of issues that

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,850
need to be fixed and we are optimizing it further.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,320
So the main issue is going to be how do we removing the duplicates from the bills?

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,480
So we'll see that a lot of libraries are getting loaded again and again, which is not the right way.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,970
Finally, once we have all those optimization in place, you're going to be seeing that the build size

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,260
has dramatically decreased and this is going to be improving our load times as well.

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,380
So we'll also see things such as pre shaking, how do we moving our styles to a separate library and

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:08,710
so on.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,340
And these are the things that are going to be really optimizing our web backbone.

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,510
So if I just talk about the pack being used in production, if you have used something like React of

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,890
View or maybe Angular, you generally might be using this here and all this configuration is being done

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,750
directly for you using those gels.

23
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,860
But we are going to be seeing exactly in the section how things happen behind the scene.

24
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,500
So I'm really excited to present all of this to you.

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,780
So let's move on and see what are the optimizations we can apply to our configurations.
