00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.220
He goes, welcome back.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.070
And in this video, we're going to be adding a convenience feature.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.470
So far, we've never made some changes in our code.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.410
So, for example, if I just open up my code base and go to the email pages, all the JavaScript files,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.840
we had to be running the build again and again.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.190
And if you're doing some major website development, this is not going to be very convenient.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.330
Now, this is one way to fix it in which you're going to be having the auto reload option.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.070
And let's see how we can be doing that.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.220
If you already use a framework like React or Vue, you might be seeing that applications created using

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.770
the Clear to React app or view initialize automatically has this feature built in and behind the scene.

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.260
They actually utilize this feature of back.

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.270
All right, so let's see how that can be implemented.

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.380
Now, following the implementation, first of all, we need to be installing an additional package.

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.150
Now, if you want to be following along with the selector, I've just copied the previous folder and

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.200
just created a new one here and I'm just going to be doing the development in a new folder.

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.770
You can just continue on and do the development in the same folder.

17
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.900
Okay.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.870
So let me just clear off my console and go to the new folder that I just created.

19
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.550
So that's 7.3 in my case and I'm going to be installing the package.

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.790
So see NPM, I saved them and this is going to be called as Webpack Dev.

21
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.510
So just notice the dashes between the words.

22
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.600
And once you have that press enter to get installing it.

23
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.960
Okay.

24
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.510
So let's just give this a minute to install.

25
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.290
Now we're going to be just making the changes in the Webpack file.

26
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.200
So if you just go to the Web config here and in this, we're going to be adding a new section to our

27
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.610
model DOT export.

28
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.530
So in the model or export, so I'm just going to be adding any place, let's call this as dev.

29
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.710
So now for the so we're going to be passing in an object and the object is going to be taking in one

30
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.220
property.

31
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.090
And this tells us exactly where are the files that is going to be distributed.

32
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.420
So in our case, all the files are going to be present in the dest folder.

33
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.630
So what I'm going to be doing overhead is will just point to that location.

34
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.080
By saying static.

35
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.810
So that started.

36
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.110
And in this, we can just point to that folder by saying dot slash just.

37
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.590
Okay.

38
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.850
So that's pretty much it.

39
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.650
Now, what will happen when we hit is basically we could have solar is going to be monitoring this folder.

40
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.440
And whenever any changes has been made to any of the files, the build is going to be created and auto

41
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.490
loaded on our browser.

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.600
So with that done, we also need a way of starting off this dev server.

43
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.340
Now for starting on the dev, so I'm just going to be writing a small script in the package audition.

44
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.250
So for now we just have two scripts.

45
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.230
So one is using the test, which we do not really use.

46
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.940
So I can actually be removing all of this.

47
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.770
And the second one is the build, which is used for building our Webpack build.

48
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.640
Okay.

49
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.710
So we are just going to be adding a new one in here.

50
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.170
We can see let's call this as maybe dev webpack solve.

51
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.240
And in this we'll see mode and the mode is going to be a development.

52
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.270
And finally, we also can passing under the perimeter saying open.

53
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.840
Now, using this open perimeter automatically, your browser is going to be opening up.

54
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.670
So that's what this perimeter is about.

55
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.930
Okay, so we have done the configuration.

56
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.860
Now we can just go ahead and make this in this.

57
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.790
So in here I'm going to be just running this particular script by saying and PM run and then see Dev.

58
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.180
Okay.

59
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.370
Let's give that a moment.

60
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.910
And as you can see now, we have already started off also running on localhost.

61
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.940
I can click on this and go to the other page as well.

62
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.460
And as you can see, this is running on a server.

63
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.390
So it's like localhost, 8000 and the file name, which is the product storage team.

64
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.910
Now when we are opening it using directly revealing finder and clicking on the file, you can see that

65
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.500
it was pointing to the absolute port on my file system, so tied to the exact location.

66
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.750
So this is not the real way.

67
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.580
How are going to be solving the files from a server?

68
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.930
This is more like how is it going to be there when you're solving a file using a server?

69
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.200
So we'll be having a server running and then you have the port for the file.

70
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.430
Okay, so that looks pretty good.

71
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.230
Now let's see the main part, whether the auto reloading works or not.

72
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.280
So what I do here, let me just make this window a bit small and let's open our code side by side to

73
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.020
see the auto reloading feature working.

74
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.300
And in this, we can just open up one of the files.

75
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.810
For example, let's take up the file called as product dot Jason.

76
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.220
So that's the file right here.

77
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.990
And in this, let's try to make some changes.

78
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.380
So maybe you can just add another property here.

79
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.480
So I just put a comma, add a new property as named just number three.

80
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.390
And let's put the title as.

81
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.690
Wedding cakes?

82
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.200
Probably.

83
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.160
Why not?

84
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.480
Okay.

85
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.040
So with that done, let me just quickly save this file.

86
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.940
And as soon as I did that, you can see that I had a bill running here and it automatically identified

87
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.160
that there was update in the product or Jason.

88
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.170
It made a new Webpack build and we also have a browser updated automatically.

89
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.350
So that's really, really convenient when you're doing the development.

90
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.840
Now you might be telling, Why didn't you tell us this before?

91
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.790
Well, sorry about that, but we had to see exactly what was happening behind the scenes.

92
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.630
Okay.

93
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.620
So from now on, we are going to be utilizing this web server whenever we are going to be doing any

94
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.550
further development.

95
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.200
So that's it about the basic plugins and how are you going to be using the Webpack dev server?

96
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.520
The next section is going to be really exciting in which you're going to be taking a full fledged project

97
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.880
and using that back to optimize that particular project.

98
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.910
So let's take a short break and start off with a new section.
