00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480
Let's take an example where I have a variable P one he calls to an empty object this time

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.150
will also assign an underscore i d equals to one.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.390
We wondered.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.250
Name equals Toe Smith.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.950
People in Dark City equals to the last.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.600
If I said db dot contact,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.550
start insert P one Onda run the scene.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.700
You'll see that it gets executed successfully,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.670
and it has given his own seeing that the end insulted is one.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.830
However,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.100
if I run the same thing once more,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.510
we get another.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.250
Because the underscore idea is more or less like a primary key off Ali VMS tables.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.540
So we cannot have the same idea now.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.830
Sometimes this may be a problem because we might have retrieved the data from the database

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.460
and then we would have modified,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.970
and we would like to save it back to interrupt the insert.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.750
If I use a sale function,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.640
Onda run the same.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.600
You will see that there is no error.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.950
How about this time?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.130
It says number off.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.080
Match to document is one absurd ID is zero will come toe the concept of observing,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.660
but at this time it is number off.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.930
Modified records is also zero.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.770
That's because we didn't make any changes.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.420
However,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.460
instead of Smith,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.690
this is Martin on Dsev Days on the run.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.260
The same.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.430
You'll see that this time.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.450
It says number off modified documents is one,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.750
and that's because we we have some different values.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.240
They did not answer,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.550
but it's just updating the existing document itself.
