00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
Theo calling the find function on a particular collection Rich use all the documents on all

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.250
the documents include all the properties.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.880
Now,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.370
sometimes you may want toe Restrict the number of documents based on certain criteria are

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.030
restrict the properties that you want to view.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.750
This is called selection on projection.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.950
The first parameter is an object representing the criteria that you want to use for

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.750
selection.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.170
I will come back on that in few minutes.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.310
But first we will see how to do a projection.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.710
The second perimeter here is the projection.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.870
For example,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.720
if you want Oh Regio only the first name last name on city off the people in your contact

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.810
list Then you can simply say here first name iss One last name is one and then city iss one

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.460
the Internet one We can also use any non zero number So zero represents funds non zero

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.150
represents true In fact,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.250
you can also type the JavaScript keyword True to say that include this particular property

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.700
When I saved this on then execute the same thing.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.350
If execute mongo on then pass on the exito Tito chairs,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.140
you will see only certain properties are being returned and especially first name last name

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.550
City.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.100
Now by default,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.950
the underscore idea is always included.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.750
If you don't want that,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.840
you can come back to your command and then say understory is false are zero.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.690
So save it on gun the same command again on you can see that we get only first name,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.750
last name and city if it exists.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.060
If the document does not contain a specific property,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.180
that property will not be included.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.650
And if it doesn't in any imagine property just an empty object is being written.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.840
One very important point that you have to remember is you cannot have a combination off

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.560
inclusion and exclusion except for the underscored I d Apart from the 80 if you use

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.350
inclusions for the properties like one are non zero are true.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.160
You may not be ableto specify expands for other fields.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.960
For example,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.050
If I try this,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.450
we get another saying that projection cannot have a big soft inclusion and exclusion.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.310
So either exclude all the fields that are mentioned here and the two remaining ones are

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.350
into only these feels and do not get any other fields from the documents
