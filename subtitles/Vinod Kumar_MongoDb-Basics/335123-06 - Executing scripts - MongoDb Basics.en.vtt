00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180
apart from running a command from with initial that are different ways Mongo db commands

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.950
can be excluded.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.880
So,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.730
for example,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.130
let me just exit from the motions and then I'm back in the sea Drive users we know folder

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.950
Commander Bond.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.440
So I'm gonna say among go on,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:29.380
then followed by a dash dash evil followed by a man db dot Contact Start finding one on

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.510
then the name of the little bit that it has to connect toe when I want to issue this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.890
command.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.500
So which is test to TV in this case and you can see that it connects to the local host Onda

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.470
to 7017 That is the before port connect shoot STB and then issues that command.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.300
Obviously,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.560
this would be a very difficult mechanism If you want to issue more than one commander If I

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.530
take mongo and Dash Trish,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.650
even Onda use Esther db semi colon and I say db dot contact Start finding one.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.660
You'll see that it's going to result in tow an error.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.670
So what?

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.360
We can do it.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.960
Ultimately,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.300
we can create a script file on,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.370
then execute the script file using the Mongol Command this would be a good option,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.630
especially when you're learning.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.880
So in order to test videos commands,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.750
let's clear work folder for ourselves.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.450
So it's going toe r C drive,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:34.120
create a new folder called Mongo Devi Dash examples and then use the same thing in sublime

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.550
text.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:53.760
So now we have,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.530
ah,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.860
folder Andi fights.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.510
That's also get into that directory.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.050
So that's gross et City.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.940
Among would be be dash examples.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.450
Onda.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.450
We can issue the commands from here now,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.870
so it's scary new.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.360
Fine.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.050
Let's call this as the x 01 dot Js.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.340
So let's have a big issue.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.780
More than one command here,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.640
for example.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.940
I want to connect to a database called Test two db on,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.010
then semi Colon.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.620
And then I can say David or Contact start,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.690
find one on.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.210
But then I can see here OIR count equals toe Devi Dart contracts start Count on,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.910
then I can even say print.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.450
There are plus count contacts.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.900
So now I have a script that actually can do some work and then I want to execute the same

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.210
thing here so I can come back to the command front and then is a mongo and then a less than

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.840
symbol,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.390
like an input redirection.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.700
And then I'll say egg 01 door.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.350
Cheers.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.660
Now this should connect to the local whose 27017 use the tested baby and then he should the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.620
rest of the conventional death on,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.280
as you can see,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.650
that the commands have been successfully executed.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.890
So in order to test various commands,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.350
let us follow this approach.
