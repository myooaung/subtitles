00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
suppose I wouldn't find apart.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.030
It was ID's 100 then I want toe update few properties off the product.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.940
So we would say,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.510
db dot products dot update And the quality is underscore.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.640
Idea is 100 and then the updating document happens to be a new one.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
Probably I can say name equals toe test product.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.240
On that,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.430
I would say Unit price happens to be,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.760
let's say,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:42.690
100.0 onda a description off the same thing happens to be best description for No.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.470
I think these property should be good enough.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.510
Let's save this and then run the same thing to run there as a mongo.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.980
Less than e extend R.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.590
J s press enter and it comes back with a result.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.220
The results says number off matched documents zero Absurd zero modified zero.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.900
The reason is very simple.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.760
We don't have the document with a 90 off 100 so let's go check it out.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.600
I go to the mongo test to levy and see DVD dot products.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.910
Don't find underscore Idea is 100 on.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.320
You can see that it came back with nothing.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.400
We can also ask Mongol Bebeto,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.830
insert a new document in case if the update failed that this concept is called upsetting.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.340
So we come back to this particular chord and then we specify here a terror perimeter where

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.890
with a absurd is too.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.150
We said that search for this document.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.650
If it is phoned,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.050
you need toe change this as the new document.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.670
If it's not found,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.110
you need toe ire,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.300
that updated audience it So one more thing is that if the product already existed with

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.470
multiple fields,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.400
all the fields will be lost and only these fields will be the new fields.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.930
So in order over that,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.650
I can say dollar set and then we can specify all these properties.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.650
So let's execute the script and check the result.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.340
And this time it is number off match documents.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.010
Zero.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.140
Number of absurd document is one modified A zero The i D.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.050
Generated happens to be 100 and that's because we supplied that.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.310
Let's go on very for the same thing,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.920
like mongo,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.950
test to Davies.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.550
And then it's a db dot thought it start.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.000
Find one with an i d off 100 on they receive.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.650
There isn't
