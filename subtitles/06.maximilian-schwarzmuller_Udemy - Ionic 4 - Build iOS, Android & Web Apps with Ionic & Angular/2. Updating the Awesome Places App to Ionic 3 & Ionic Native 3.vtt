WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:09.040
And The Last Lecture I walked you Rudy release notes of the latest version of ionic 3.0.

00:09.060 --> 00:14.750
Now I told you that there isn't that much which changes it now uses angular floor but angular four isn't

00:14.750 --> 00:19.020
a breaking change to angle or two and a ionic free also isn't.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.490
But we may.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.300
And that's important.

00:21.300 --> 00:21.870
We may.

00:21.870 --> 00:27.740
We don't have to use another new feature the latest version of the ionic native library.

00:27.840 --> 00:35.070
And if we do choose to do so then we actually do have to make a couple of changes but still doable.

00:35.070 --> 00:36.230
So let's take a closer look.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.840
And let's upgrade our project today on a free.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.690
We actually see how we should update the package.

00:42.700 --> 00:47.670
Our Jason efile here so we can copy that code of the dependencies.

00:47.670 --> 00:50.850
I'm deliberately not copying all the code in here.

00:51.060 --> 00:52.850
And then there's also some places.

00:52.870 --> 00:54.840
I loaded the tear in web storm.

00:54.840 --> 01:00.170
We can go to package Chaisson and now you could try to override everything here.

01:00.300 --> 01:04.350
But keep in mind we for example still import angler to Google maps here.

01:04.530 --> 01:09.540
So I will only override all the angular and ionic imports up here.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.770
And then I will simply remove the duplicates I have here.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.800
So I own icons and so on.

01:15.030 --> 01:19.060
So that I now have to is clean usage of.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.550
Or does clean dependencies list.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.440
I will also remove ionic native though because that is what I meant.

01:25.590 --> 01:27.610
We were using words in two.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.490
We will update tuition free.

01:29.670 --> 01:33.370
And that actually has a different package structure as you can see here.

01:33.390 --> 01:38.400
We now have at ionic native and then we import the individual plug ins you want to use.

01:38.850 --> 01:43.580
So that's all updated dev dependencies before we work on ionic native though.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.100
So copy that code and overwrite my development dependencies down here.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.690
And with that we prepared our package.

01:51.810 --> 01:59.180
Jason File here now as a next step we should add the browser module to our app module file.

01:59.190 --> 01:59.870
This is new.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.810
We didn't have to do that before.

02:01.830 --> 02:06.350
That has something to do with the internals behind Iyonix 2 and what changed there.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.510
So any app module in our source app folder.

02:09.780 --> 02:16.720
I will simply add the same port at the top your browser module and I will then add it to my imports

02:16.750 --> 02:21.180
aere your the browser module like this.

02:21.210 --> 02:24.860
Now with data that we can move on this is a step I just did.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.940
So now step three if you are using H should it be.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.320
So let's say we are.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.750
We also have to add D.H. to be module to our imports.

02:33.750 --> 02:43.010
So let's add HTP module to inboards and let's therefore also import that from at a singular age to DP.

02:43.050 --> 02:52.650
So you're ultimately import the age to be module from at a singular age to be with that added.

02:52.890 --> 02:59.940
We're almost done now we have to upgrade our code to use ionic native free before I do so I will delete

02:59.940 --> 03:04.190
my note modules folder because I want to re-install all the dependencies.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.350
We change them in the package don't chase and file.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.840
Of course we now also need to run NPM install to install all these versions.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.490
We set up there so of node modules deleted.

03:13.680 --> 03:21.000
I will now run NPM and Stohl to well again install all the words I listed in the package adjacent file

03:21.260 --> 03:27.650
and once this is done I'll be back and will then work on using Iyonix native free so the installation

03:27.650 --> 03:29.160
of the package has just finished.

03:29.160 --> 03:36.270
No I want to adjust my code to use ionic native and free since I remove the old ionic native package

03:36.480 --> 03:41.820
to code in the places where I used it like an at least RTX won't work anymore like this.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.890
Import here so we can already remove it.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.290
It won't work anymore.

03:45.640 --> 03:52.560
Now with that of course we need to somehow still get our native packages and we have to install them

03:52.560 --> 03:53.500
one by one.

03:53.730 --> 03:59.670
So I will run and install dash dash save tool to store a reference in the package adjacent file and

03:59.670 --> 04:04.110
then add ionic native with a dash in between and then slash.

04:04.110 --> 04:11.130
And now the name of the native plug in with a lowercase leading character like camera like so or I will

04:11.130 --> 04:19.470
also install the next one ionic native geolocation which I also use in this project or ionic native

04:19.950 --> 04:22.540
file move a lowercase F..

04:22.650 --> 04:29.070
I will now enter and this will install all these packages I need here for my code to work.

04:29.160 --> 04:34.560
Now with that installed we could start using it here but we actually use it differently.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.730
We now inject all these native features.

04:38.790 --> 04:45.810
We no longer import them and then access them we're like a static class as we did here accessing geolocation

04:45.810 --> 04:46.680
directly.

04:46.860 --> 04:49.390
Instead we inject them in our constructor.

04:49.620 --> 04:59.070
So here what I do is I will add a private property geolocation of type geo location and geolocation.

04:59.070 --> 05:04.170
Now should be imported from our newly added package.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.220
So from.

05:05.280 --> 05:11.160
At ionic native and now geo location.

05:11.190 --> 05:12.970
The one we just installed.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.550
So that is the package from which I will pick geolocation.

05:18.060 --> 05:20.700
So that's the first plug in I need.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.500
Here are CLOS I need here.

05:22.500 --> 05:31.560
I will also need to camera so camera of type camera and is now also fetched from ionic native camera.

05:31.560 --> 05:41.340
Make sure to add this import and we also use the file in is where some files specific classes in this

05:41.340 --> 05:41.730
file.

05:41.730 --> 05:51.450
Here in this page so I will also add private word file of type file and import this from ionic native

05:51.600 --> 05:52.180
file.

05:52.200 --> 06:00.630
So it is important to with these imports Adelante things inject the tea or the classes we need to adjust

06:00.660 --> 06:05.520
our code when we access get current position on geolocation.

06:05.520 --> 06:12.300
We now have to use this geolocation so the private property which gets injected automatically and the

06:12.300 --> 06:13.900
same of course for the camera.

06:13.920 --> 06:20.100
We now use this camera and the same for file obviously does file.

06:20.160 --> 06:25.710
Now regarding entry here we have to import that from the file package.

06:25.710 --> 06:28.320
So here we need entry and already noted.

06:28.320 --> 06:34.790
I will also need the file error or with that we can then again use these type assignments here.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.340
I also overlooked a camera.

06:36.350 --> 06:43.200
So here is this camera encoding type and here of course it does camera clean up as it is down here.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.010
This camera cleanup.

06:45.210 --> 06:50.190
So really just replacing all these static references we had there before.

06:50.550 --> 06:54.930
Now since we injected here there is one important thing we have to do.

06:55.080 --> 07:01.950
We have to provide it so we have to go to the app module and your improvisors we should add these new

07:01.950 --> 07:02.720
services.

07:02.760 --> 07:09.670
So file from ionic native files and make sure to add to importante module too.

07:10.220 --> 07:17.240
And to say of course for our camera geolocation and any other native plugin you might be using so geolocation

07:17.250 --> 07:18.580
in our case here.

07:20.050 --> 07:26.960
Make sure to add all these imports so I still need to add the one for geolocation here.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.610
And with that we provide a year.

07:29.830 --> 07:35.650
We also need to adjust our app component though because here we also use native features status bar

07:35.740 --> 07:37.420
and splash screen.

07:37.630 --> 07:43.480
I also need to inject DS so I don't need to as I'm private I don't need to create a prop. We can just

07:43.480 --> 07:57.550
say status bar of type status bar here and splash screen of type splash screen WIPs splash screen like

07:57.550 --> 07:58.450
this.

07:58.570 --> 08:06.020
We need to add our imports your ionic native remove that.

08:06.130 --> 08:11.740
And here we need to import from Splash.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.060
Let's have a look at a.

08:13.090 --> 08:15.100
Jason how is that written.

08:15.100 --> 08:22.240
We have splash screen with a dash in between so a splash screen employed splash screen.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.960
What's wrong about the status bar.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.660
I should be fine.

08:25.660 --> 08:30.600
So with that we hear of course all you have to say status bar using these arguments now.

08:30.850 --> 08:38.330
And Splash screen with this app component fall is all fixed at place should be fixed.

08:38.340 --> 08:46.710
We also need to fix a number that's to service fall places because here if you look at the imports we

08:46.800 --> 08:49.600
also use file from ionic native.

08:49.830 --> 08:56.910
So we should import that from an iconic native slash file now and then we should of course inject that

08:56.910 --> 08:57.170
here.

08:57.180 --> 09:08.450
So private file of type file and then whenever we use file or replace it with this file so data is number

09:08.450 --> 09:09.020
change.

09:09.020 --> 09:13.090
Now these service places touchiest should also be updated correctly.

09:13.400 --> 09:22.010
Now what we can do is we can go to our app Marchal again because we need to change the way we use to

09:22.010 --> 09:22.830
storage.

09:22.850 --> 09:24.710
That's number tiny change.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.690
We no longer provide it.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.670
So remove it from providers.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.590
We no longer need to import storage.

09:31.610 --> 09:35.620
Instead we now have to import the Iyonix storage module.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.660
And with that important we go to imports.

09:38.930 --> 09:47.030
And here we added with the four route Cole like does nothing else needs to be done now with this all

09:47.030 --> 09:47.970
in place.

09:48.110 --> 09:54.530
Let's try this out and run Iyonix serve to serve our app and let's see if we overlooked something here.

09:54.830 --> 09:59.960
Well the bolt proses was successful but we get an error in the browser that we don't have a provider

09:59.960 --> 10:02.880
for a status bar and that is absolutely correct.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.260
I forgot to add them here.

10:04.310 --> 10:12.920
So we need status bar and also splash screen at diddies to two providers and make sure to add the respective

10:12.980 --> 10:15.580
imports here at the top too.

10:15.590 --> 10:22.000
Now with that let's save this to start you recompilation and let's have a look if this now is fixed.

10:22.120 --> 10:28.780
That looks much better let's open the developer tools go to a new place page and let me look at myself

10:28.780 --> 10:30.130
to see if that works.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.250
And that's fine.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.000
I'm not living there as a side note.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.560
Just some random place.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.620
So that looks all right now.

10:37.870 --> 10:45.380
And with that we get a working application again now updated to ironic free and using ionic native free.

10:45.550 --> 10:53.080
So the key steps were to update the way we add and use our native plug ins and to change the way we

10:53.080 --> 10:54.960
use the storage here.

10:54.970 --> 10:59.590
Also if you're using the grid keep doesn't mind to update the grid and what that you should be fine.

10:59.590 --> 11:04.060
You should be able to upgrade your existing applications to a onic free.
