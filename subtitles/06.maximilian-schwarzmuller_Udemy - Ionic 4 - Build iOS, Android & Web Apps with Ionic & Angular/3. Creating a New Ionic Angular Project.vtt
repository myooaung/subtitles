00:02.170 --> 00:09.820
With that out of the way, we can now create a new Ionic Angular project and for this, you should open

00:09.820 --> 00:17.230
your terminal or command prompt and navigate into the path where you want to create your project folder.

00:17.230 --> 00:23.710
Now we will use the Ionic CLI which is a tool provided by the Ionic team for creating this project

00:23.770 --> 00:27.700
because that is the easiest way of setting up an Ionic Angular project

00:27.700 --> 00:28.670
you can find.

00:28.930 --> 00:35.140
Now for that to be usable, in case you skipped Module 1 of this course, you first of all need to install

00:35.140 --> 00:39.060
NodeJS from nodejs.org. There

00:39.160 --> 00:45.420
fetch the latest version and only if you are facing issues with that, choose the LTS version here.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.180
So choose the latest version, download it and go through the installer,

00:49.180 --> 00:53.350
it's available for Mac and Windows and you get a convenient installer through which you simply have to

00:53.350 --> 00:57.700
go and we do install NodeJS for two reasons.

00:57.700 --> 01:05.200
Reason number one is that it also gives us Node's Package Manager, NPM, which is the defacto standard package

01:05.200 --> 01:12.430
manager for managing Javascript dependencies, not only in NodeJS projects but actually in any project

01:12.430 --> 01:13.690
that uses Javascript,

01:13.750 --> 01:19.470
no matter if it's a front-end or back-end project and therefore our Angular Ionic project also will

01:19.480 --> 01:25.600
use NPM to manage its dependencies and with dependencies, I mean things like the Angular framework, the

01:25.600 --> 01:32.710
Ionic framework and dependencies of these frameworks. So that's the first reason, NPM,

01:32.710 --> 01:39.760
the second reason is NodeJS itself. Even though we'll not write any NodeJS code in this course, we

01:39.760 --> 01:40.270
need

01:40.310 --> 01:49.370
NodeJS because behind the scenes, the Angular CLI and the Ionic CLI which we'll both use use NodeJS

01:49.540 --> 01:56.680
to build our project, to spin up a development server where we can preview our app and so on. So download

01:56.680 --> 01:59.260
and install NodeJS and thereafter,

01:59.260 --> 02:03.430
make sure you also have the Ionic CLI installed.

02:03.550 --> 02:09.340
Now in case you need detailed instructions, you can find that on ionicframework.com, under developers

02:09.430 --> 02:12.370
installation and then install with CLI.

02:12.730 --> 02:17.950
It's this command with NPM installed which you have to execute.

02:17.950 --> 02:24.550
So let's copy that into our terminal here and on Mac and Linux, you might need to add a sudo in front

02:24.550 --> 02:30.490
of this, on Windows make sure you're running the command prompt as administrator by right-clicking on

02:30.490 --> 02:36.700
its executable and then choosing run as administrator and this will now install the Ionic CLI

02:36.760 --> 02:39.130
globally on your machine.

02:39.130 --> 02:47.640
Now we do need that Ionic CLI for things like creating new projects but also then to run our projects,

02:47.650 --> 02:54.900
to build our app, especially then also to build a mobile app, that is something where the Ionic CLI

02:54.910 --> 03:01.810
will be important and this is generally our global Ionic project management tool you could say. Now with

03:01.810 --> 03:09.520
it installed and navigated into that folder here where you want to create your project, run Ionic start

03:09.820 --> 03:16.390
and you saw this command in the first module of the course already, this allows you to create a new project.

03:16.390 --> 03:23.080
Now first of all here as it tells you, you should choose a project name and I will simply go with

03:25.680 --> 03:32.940
ionic-angular-course, you can of course choose any name you want. Then you should pick a template and

03:32.940 --> 03:38.220
I will go with the blank template, if you would use another template, you would start with certain features

03:38.280 --> 03:44.130
already added in the dummy app you get out of the box but we will add these features step-by-step together

03:44.130 --> 03:44.910
in this course

03:44.910 --> 03:50.220
so that you learn all about them. Hence let's go with the blank template and this will now create a new

03:50.220 --> 03:56.550
project and install all the required dependencies of the project which will take a while and I'll be

03:56.550 --> 04:04.010
back once it's done. Once the installation finished, you're asked whether you want to install the free

04:04.100 --> 04:06.800
AppFlow SDK and you don't need that,

04:07.120 --> 04:09.510
it's an extra tool offered by Ionic,

04:09.560 --> 04:14.100
you can find more information about it in the official Ionic docs of course,

04:14.420 --> 04:17.860
there you can find out what AppFlow is. In the end,

04:17.870 --> 04:23.690
it's a service that requires you to sign up, you can sign up for free and then you can also test your

04:23.690 --> 04:30.050
app a bit easier on native devices and you can even build it in the cloud which also allows you as a

04:30.050 --> 04:32.760
Windows user to for example build iOS apps,

04:32.810 --> 04:37.380
that then however will be a paid feature and therefore, I'll not show it in this course.

04:37.430 --> 04:43.720
So I'll choose no here, we don't need that and thereafter, I created this project. We could now run it

04:43.730 --> 04:45.330
with the instructions you see here

04:45.350 --> 04:50.810
but I'll actually not do that and instead, open that in my editor of choice which is still Visual Studio

04:50.810 --> 04:52.270
Code.

04:52.430 --> 04:56.300
Here is the created project open in Visual Studio Code,

04:56.300 --> 05:02.990
now one quick note about Visual Studio Code. Under view extensions here, you can actually make sure

05:02.990 --> 05:05.570
that you install the Angular essentials,

05:05.570 --> 05:11.670
simply search for Angular essentials up here to make your life as an Angular developer a bit easier

05:11.690 --> 05:19.700
in case you don't have these extensions yet and I also used and will still use the material icon theme

05:20.000 --> 05:21.580
which you can always install from there.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.550
This is optional,

05:22.580 --> 05:27.230
it just changes the file icons in the project but still, this is the exact same look I have,

05:27.230 --> 05:32.120
so if you want to have that same look, make sure to install this extension, thereafter you can go back

05:32.120 --> 05:34.280
to view explorer.

05:34.280 --> 05:40.160
So this is the project and it basically and that is important, is a normal Angular project.

05:40.160 --> 05:46.190
Now let me walk you through it and explain where it differs from a normal Angular project and how it

05:46.190 --> 05:47.420
is connected to Ionic.
