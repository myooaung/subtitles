00:02.190 --> 00:09.080
The component will use now allows us to pick a date ionic has a dedicated component that makes picking

00:09.080 --> 00:14.630
dates pretty easy and that offers a lot of features and therefore lets add that component.

00:14.620 --> 00:21.410
Now I'll add a new ion row here and I'll add I an item with the ion label because that date component

00:21.410 --> 00:27.380
will work like a regular form input which is a really good thing and therefore we can use it to get

00:27.380 --> 00:36.610
rid of the label and so on and I'll set the title here to away label from so that users can define for

00:36.640 --> 00:40.090
which timespan they want to offer their place.

00:40.090 --> 00:47.380
And now I will remove the ion input and instead at the ion date time component here and that will give

00:47.380 --> 00:49.700
us a nice date picker.

00:49.730 --> 00:57.790
Now the cool thing is there you can see that Min and a max value and you can of course populate that

00:58.090 --> 00:59.000
dynamically.

00:59.050 --> 01:04.870
You could bind this with square brackets to any value you calculate and typescript for now it will just

01:04.870 --> 01:12.100
bind it to a hard coded values and you enter dates here in the ISO format and you'll find more about

01:12.100 --> 01:18.460
that in the official ionic docs on the daytime component and one valid input for example is a four digit

01:18.460 --> 01:21.890
year then a dash then the month then the day.

01:21.940 --> 01:29.020
So let's say we want to allow dates from January the 1st 2019 all the way up to December thirty first

01:29.380 --> 01:36.070
in 2022 and of course as I said you could calculate this dynamically you could also set a longer range

01:36.100 --> 01:39.520
all the way to 25 whatever you want.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.910
So now this is my available from date time.

01:42.910 --> 01:49.390
Now I actually want to set the available to date time control next to this one therefore I'll change

01:49.390 --> 01:52.330
the size here on small devices.

01:52.330 --> 01:58.990
This should have a width of 3 still have offset of free because I'll add another call them next to it

01:59.140 --> 02:03.700
in the same ion row which has no offset but the same size.

02:03.700 --> 02:10.690
And there I'll have my available cute label and daytime and I'll keep almost the same min and max value

02:10.900 --> 02:16.690
I'll only increase the min value to the 2nd January because well that you have to at least offer it

02:16.690 --> 02:18.370
for one day I guess.

02:18.370 --> 02:22.470
And since this is the lowest value here the lowest value here should be one day.

02:22.510 --> 02:30.370
Beneath that obviously the December value is equal but you can definitely find you this to your requirements.

02:30.370 --> 02:33.220
So now we have all these controls in place.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.280
The buttons are missing though right.

02:35.320 --> 02:43.020
Well here all yet fancy and I'll add my button in the toolbar so I'll add ion buttons here and give

02:43.020 --> 02:49.450
them a slot of primary which should be on the right side of the toolbar on most devices and I'll add

02:49.450 --> 02:50.930
a line button in there.

02:52.310 --> 03:01.210
Which will when clicked trigger on create offer method

03:04.930 --> 03:12.390
and in there I'll add an an icon with a name of checkmark which is well rendering a checkmark icon that

03:12.390 --> 03:13.400
takes you.

03:13.460 --> 03:19.170
I can only slot so that it is style to give us a nice button that only displaced as I can.

03:19.190 --> 03:26.560
Now let's implement t on create offer method in the types could file and for now just log

03:29.200 --> 03:32.460
creating offered to place or something like that.

03:33.660 --> 03:34.900
Now let's have a look at that.

03:34.950 --> 03:39.120
So let's wait for this page to reload.

03:39.150 --> 03:40.050
Now here we are.

03:40.190 --> 03:48.590
And I should probably change the styling where I give every column this red border and the new all four

03:48.590 --> 03:50.360
page SC is as follows.

03:50.420 --> 03:54.220
It certainly will look better without that but with that that looks pretty good.

03:54.560 --> 04:03.920
And you can see if I tap one of these drawers here I got my date picker where I can select a date unsurprisingly

04:04.400 --> 04:09.920
and all the other inputs here all the work as they should and we got this button that correctly calls

04:09.920 --> 04:10.550
this method.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.460
So that is all nice.

04:12.530 --> 04:16.640
Now for the logic how do we handle our inputs here.

04:16.640 --> 04:20.520
How do we let angular know about them and create a form object.
