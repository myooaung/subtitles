00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.910
In the last lecture we changed the theming of the app an important step to get the final result.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.780
When it comes to the Weasel part of it too.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.770
Now I want to have a look at the content of our application and to start with the content of Yep.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.350
And I want to start with this shopping list page before we then come to the more complex part of editing

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.060
our recipes the shopping lists page if you recall how it looked like is a relatively simple page.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.050
All we have on it is this form at the top with two input fields for name and amount.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.810
And then this add button.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.480
And well if we do add the item you see it here on the very last view and the bottom right.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
We actually see those buttons pull loads for them and we can tap them to remove them.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.640
So what we will need for days is some service to store our shopping list our list of items and to also

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.150
have methods which allow us to add or delete items and we also need to set up his form of course.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.020
Now we will set up the form together because that's something we haven't done yet.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.780
The service is something you can then try creating on your own.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.240
But again let's start with the form in the next lectures
