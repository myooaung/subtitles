WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:04.860
So let's implement this step by step.

00:04.860 --> 00:10.170
The first step is that I simply want to open a camera on a native device.

00:10.350 --> 00:21.240
And for this we can use capacitor let's import plugins and capacitor from at capacitor slash core.

00:21.350 --> 00:28.140
And with that imported in on pig image here I will first of all check if the plugin is available.

00:28.150 --> 00:33.220
So if capacitor is plugging away lable camera.

00:33.520 --> 00:41.140
And if this is not the case here then we should have a plan B then we should have no way of getting

00:41.140 --> 00:41.670
an image.

00:41.710 --> 00:43.690
For now I'll just refer nothing here.

00:43.690 --> 00:46.030
We'll take care about this case later.

00:46.310 --> 00:47.960
After does it check here.

00:47.980 --> 00:55.510
Let's use plugins DOT camera and there we have a get photo method.

00:55.510 --> 00:56.950
This method does.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.680
Again just what it sounds like.

00:58.990 --> 01:04.890
Now we can't configured is and we have to consider it as we can to find a quality of the image.

01:04.930 --> 01:10.210
And of course you shouldn't pick too high of a quality because higher qualities mean bigger images which

01:10.210 --> 01:12.520
become more difficult to handle and upload.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.720
So I'll go with 50.

01:13.720 --> 01:19.690
The maximum value here is one hundred minimum value is one and then add the source key here.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.860
And for that I'll use the camera.

01:21.860 --> 01:29.810
Source object which is imported from add capacity or core the camera source is simply giving us some

01:29.810 --> 01:37.930
default here and I want to use the prompt source here which means we are asked whether we want to use

01:37.930 --> 01:40.240
the camera or the image gallery.

01:40.330 --> 01:44.290
You could of course also forced the user to use just a gallery or just a camera.

01:44.320 --> 01:53.440
But I will offer the user choice here I'll set correct orientation to true which makes sure that the

01:53.440 --> 01:59.230
orientation of the image is automatically fixed and it's not rotating images just because you took them

01:59.260 --> 02:00.760
in let's say portrait mode.

02:01.850 --> 02:08.090
You can also set a height and A with 40 image and also at a height of 320 and a width of 200.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.410
And again you want to choose dimensions here which don't lead to an overly large image.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.720
Instead think about what you'll be using the image for and then try to take an image with an appropriate

02:17.720 --> 02:23.510
size because the bigger the image the harder it gets to upload it anywhere and to use it to slower your

02:23.510 --> 02:30.530
apples or gets in last but not least you set the result type here and there we can use the camera result

02:30.530 --> 02:35.060
type object which is also important from at capacitor core.

02:35.110 --> 02:40.760
The camera result type just as the camera source gives us a couple of options here and I will go with

02:40.760 --> 02:46.850
base 64 which means that the image is encoded into a string which we then can convert to a file if we

02:46.850 --> 02:54.100
want to or just use like that you can of course as always learn all about your options here in the official

02:54.100 --> 03:00.040
box for the camera plug in there you'll learn all about its usage and about the different methods it

03:00.040 --> 03:08.690
has and how to configure it I will now change then here and this will give me my image eventually or

03:08.690 --> 03:14.720
hopefully so it will but we might also get an error for whatever reason maybe because we didn't get

03:14.720 --> 03:19.420
permissions or maybe because something went wrong when we tried to get that image.

03:20.060 --> 03:25.670
And in this case here I will for one locked error but we might of course also want to think about an

03:25.670 --> 03:31.250
alternative here now in the then case with just a case I'll focus on right now.

03:31.400 --> 03:38.090
We have an image and therefore here I eventually want to emit an event so I'll create my own listenable

03:38.090 --> 03:44.820
event with at output which is imported from at La core and all named is image.

03:45.080 --> 03:52.130
Just as the location picker we have that location Pick event here.

03:52.270 --> 03:58.900
I'll have my image Pick event which is a new event emitter and I will emit a string here and that will

03:58.900 --> 04:01.390
be that base64.

04:01.450 --> 04:08.590
You are Al which I'm emitting essentially what I will also do in here is I will set this selected image

04:09.100 --> 04:16.810
equal to the image we get here and there to the base64 data which is a property that's only available

04:16.810 --> 04:26.210
if you chose base64 here and of course I will set this or I will call this image pig emit and emit my

04:27.020 --> 04:30.890
image there all to the base 64 data which I picked.

04:30.890 --> 04:34.430
OK so with that we have everything in place we should need here.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.030
Now let's use that.

04:36.080 --> 04:41.720
And of course I want to use my image picture a component here in my new offer a component.

04:41.720 --> 04:47.880
Now first of all make sure that it is added to the shared module here and it is for me image.

04:47.960 --> 04:56.090
Picture component is declared there and therefore in the new offer a component and then you offer page

04:56.390 --> 05:00.210
we should be able to use it because we're able to use the location picture there as well.

05:00.650 --> 05:08.300
So in a new offer Page let me copy that row here with the location picker and simply replace this with

05:08.300 --> 05:11.510
the image picker.

05:11.510 --> 05:18.440
So I have my app image picker with the image pick form event and listening to and then I want to execute

05:18.590 --> 05:21.300
on image picked here.

05:21.320 --> 05:27.230
Now I'm getting an error here for one of course because on image picked which should be written like

05:27.230 --> 05:29.450
this is a method I haven't added yet.

05:29.450 --> 05:37.610
So let's add it here maybe next to on location picked we'll get our image data here which will be a

05:37.610 --> 05:42.740
string but right now will not do anything with it but I'm also getting an error because an image picker

05:42.740 --> 05:49.130
is not recognized here despite us adding it to the shared module if you want to use it in our modules

05:49.130 --> 05:50.240
you have to export it.

05:50.510 --> 05:58.730
So here in your exports array add the image picker component and now with that everything should work

05:58.850 --> 06:02.780
here in the new offer page component as well.

06:02.780 --> 06:10.400
Digital work now and now let's have a look at our application we go to offers and we create a new offer

06:10.490 --> 06:12.650
and I'm in the browser here.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.680
I have that at the stylings yet we'll do this soon.

06:15.680 --> 06:22.130
Let's click take picture and we get an error camera model percent is not a function and that is quite

06:22.130 --> 06:22.890
interesting.

06:22.910 --> 06:29.600
The problem we have here is that actually capacitor tried to take an image here because that actually

06:29.600 --> 06:31.580
is possible in the browser here.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.630
If you have a Web cam on your machine.

06:33.830 --> 06:41.030
But for that to work in the browser it needs an extra package that renders a nice view a nice user interface

06:41.030 --> 06:48.230
for taking an image because unlike on native mobile devices the browser has no built in user interface

06:48.230 --> 06:52.090
for when you want to take a picture you have to build that on your own.

06:52.220 --> 06:57.170
And the ionic team did that for you but you have to add an extra package to use that user interface

06:57.830 --> 06:59.550
and we'll do this soon.

06:59.570 --> 07:01.790
For now let's focus on the mobile apps here.

07:02.180 --> 07:09.650
And therefore I will quit this and I will run ionic capacitor run Android and then of course ionic capacitor

07:09.710 --> 07:11.620
run ISIS as well.

07:11.620 --> 07:16.110
And with that let's see if it works on these mobile devices.

07:16.160 --> 07:16.670
Here I am.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.240
Let's have a look here on Android.

07:21.260 --> 07:25.730
Let's take a picture and we're asked whether we want to grant permission.

07:25.730 --> 07:30.230
Now if I denied this then I will not be able to do so.

07:30.230 --> 07:31.760
So let's for now allowed us.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.920
And now I am asked automatically we didn't at this action sheet but this happens because we chose an

07:36.920 --> 07:41.660
image source of prompt whenever we want to access our gallery or take a picture.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.010
Now I'll take a picture here and.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.250
Then here is this nice interface and dummy picture.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.120
The emulator it gives us.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.760
Now let's take a picture here and confirm this and we see our picture here.

07:54.760 --> 08:00.970
Now we probably want to change to the styling here a little bit too Naik not to take the full size of

08:00.970 --> 08:02.410
the picture we took.

08:02.440 --> 08:08.070
You can also see that quality isn't that great and that we restrict that to size somehow and that therefore

08:08.080 --> 08:14.410
this is a not in the best quality possible but it will do for us and we will actually not needed in

08:14.410 --> 08:15.150
that size.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.760
So that should be fine.

08:16.870 --> 08:20.130
Now let's alter tried here on I was here.

08:20.170 --> 08:27.620
Let me take a picture and now here on the IRS emulator actually taking a picture with the camera doesn't

08:27.620 --> 08:27.990
work.

08:28.010 --> 08:29.840
It's not available on the simulator.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.640
So here you have to choose from photos.

08:32.750 --> 08:36.120
You could only test it on a real device and see if it works there.

08:36.170 --> 08:42.410
But if I chose if I choose a photo here we see here Dad is taken and indeed here also we have a quality

08:42.770 --> 08:45.020
problem though it's not really a problem.

08:45.110 --> 08:47.870
It's on purpose other than that.

08:47.870 --> 08:50.500
This is looking really good.

08:50.570 --> 08:52.090
This seems to work.

08:52.100 --> 08:55.510
We can take these images now let's add some styling.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.070
Let's make sure that it works in the browser too.

08:58.160 --> 09:05.780
And let's provide a fallback in case the user didn't grant permissions or Dad we are running this app

09:05.810 --> 09:07.640
on a device that doesn't have a camera.
