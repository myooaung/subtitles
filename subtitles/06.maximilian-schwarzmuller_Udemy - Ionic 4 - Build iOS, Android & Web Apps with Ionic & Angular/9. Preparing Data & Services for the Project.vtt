00:02.220 --> 00:06.720
With the tabs added and by the way of course, you can also style them and change the color and so on,

00:06.720 --> 00:11.940
that is something we'll have a look at in the styling and theming section but with the tabs added, I

00:11.940 --> 00:18.780
now want to work on the content of these pages to have some basic dummy content we can use to then navigate

00:18.780 --> 00:22.710
to the other pages we have which are currently not reachable for us.

00:22.740 --> 00:25.980
With that, I want to start on the discover page. There

00:25.980 --> 00:30.850
let me go to discover, discover page here.

00:30.980 --> 00:37.760
First of all, I'll change the title here to discover places, you can of course use any title you want

00:38.460 --> 00:45.260
and in there I want to output a featured place and below that, a list of places. We'll get more fancy regarding

00:45.260 --> 00:51.020
the styling and we'll also add real data later but we can start with dummy data and some basic layout

00:51.050 --> 00:55.360
and styling already I guess. So for that,

00:55.720 --> 01:01.110
let's first of all set up a data source we can use to manage our places and

01:01.170 --> 01:02.930
for this next to my places page,

01:02.950 --> 01:04.600
I'll add a new service.

01:04.780 --> 01:11.350
We can do this manually or of course, you can always run Ionic generate service and then that would be

01:11.350 --> 01:15.190
in the places folder and the service should also be named places.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.160
This will now generate this new service in that place, 

01:18.160 --> 01:19.420
here it is.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.700
I'll remove the spec testing file, we don't need that right now

01:22.980 --> 01:27.700
and here, that places service, here I want to manage my places.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.240
Now we'll get more sophisticated there

01:30.370 --> 01:33.550
throughout this course, for now I'll start really simple,

01:33.820 --> 01:42.010
I'll have a private underscore places property which is an array and I'll add a getter which I'll

01:42.010 --> 01:49.800
name places without an underscore where I return a copy of this places, so that we can directly edit

01:49.800 --> 01:57.390
the array from other places where we get access to that array and well it also makes sense to define

01:57.420 --> 02:03.210
some data model we can work with, so that we have some clearly defined structure of how a place should

02:03.210 --> 02:07.750
look like in our application. For that next to the places service,

02:07.770 --> 02:19.090
I'll add a place.model.ts file and in there, I'll export a class which I'll just name place,

02:19.290 --> 02:24.330
you can of course name it whatever you want and then we'll have a constructor where I heavily use that

02:24.360 --> 02:30.630
Typescript shortcut of adding public or private in front of an argument to automatically bind that argument

02:30.630 --> 02:32.880
to an equally named class property.

02:33.630 --> 02:35.370
And now what should a place have?

02:35.610 --> 02:46.140
Let's say a place has some ID which is a string, a place will also have a title which is a string and

02:46.140 --> 02:58.450
a place will definitely also have a description which is a string, a place will have an image URL

02:58.460 --> 03:05.610
which is a string and a place will also have a price which is a number actually.

03:05.850 --> 03:13.500
And we can fine tune this and refine this later to add things like a location, availability and stuff

03:13.500 --> 03:14.280
like that

03:14.280 --> 03:17.330
but for now, this is my simple setup with which I want to go.

03:17.610 --> 03:23.640
Now with that added in the places service, I can make clear that my places here will be of type place.

03:23.700 --> 03:32.580
So now I will add my place model and for that, you need to add import at the top and import place from

03:33.120 --> 03:42.920
./place_model and it should be an array of places here of course, not a single place

03:42.920 --> 03:44.000
and now with that set up,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.110
let's add some dummy places. Now for that we need an ID,

03:49.340 --> 03:58.740
we can also use the constructor here of course, new place and then pass in the ID, P1 maybe, title Manhattan

04:00.570 --> 04:01.320
mansion,

04:03.680 --> 04:14.060
description in the heart of New York City, then an image URL which I prepared here,

04:14.070 --> 04:21.400
you can of course simply use Google image search and find any image that fits your name and a price

04:21.480 --> 04:22.880
and I'll use

04:23.040 --> 04:28.410
149.99 per night let's say, that is what our price is for. Now

04:28.420 --> 04:33.540
I'll add another place next to it, gets an ID of P2,

04:36.210 --> 04:39.620
let's name it L'Amour Toujours,

04:41.120 --> 04:43.100
so some French place

04:43.600 --> 04:52.290
which is let's say a romantic place in Paris

04:58.580 --> 05:07.200
which comes at a cost at let's say 189.99 per night and let's add a third

05:07.200 --> 05:08.970
place, shall we

05:08.970 --> 05:22.360
with let's say an idea of P3, the foggy palace which is actually not your average city trip, there

05:22.360 --> 05:29.680
I also picked an image in advance, you can of course search for any foggy image you find, foggy city image

05:29.680 --> 05:35.480
you find and that will come at let's say 99.99 per night.

05:35.630 --> 05:42.760
Okay now I got the three places here and here auto-completion messed up my string but that's fine. So

05:42.770 --> 05:48.210
I got my three places here in the service, I got a getter to get these places. With that prepared. let's

05:48.210 --> 05:51.020
now get them and let's display them in the discover page.
