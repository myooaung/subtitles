WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:06.900
So now in this module we had a look at native device features and you'll learn that the capacitor is

00:06.900 --> 00:12.960
not only the tool that wraps your web app but also the tool that provides a bridge to native API eyes

00:13.110 --> 00:16.240
that allow you to access the camera or to location.

00:16.260 --> 00:21.810
You'll also learn that with the help of DPW tools you can get a similar functionality in the browser

00:21.900 --> 00:24.880
at least if your device supports it and has a camera.

00:25.020 --> 00:27.560
And also how you can provide a fallback.

00:27.570 --> 00:32.790
Now these are all tools you can of course now mix and match in your applications as you need them.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.580
Not every application is built in the same way.

00:35.580 --> 00:41.040
You might need more robust error handling or handle different scenarios in your app.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.150
But I hope that this module helps you understand capacitor and how you may use it.

00:46.260 --> 00:52.050
And I can only encourage you to play around with the many core API as it exposes to you as well as to

00:52.050 --> 00:57.910
community plug ins you can install also check to plug in installation documentation for dad.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.170
And with that you have a lot of power at your hands.

01:01.170 --> 01:03.960
That should allow you to build any mobile app you want.
