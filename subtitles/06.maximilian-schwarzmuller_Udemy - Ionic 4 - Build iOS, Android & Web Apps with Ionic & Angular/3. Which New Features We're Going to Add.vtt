00:02.090 --> 00:08.520
So which new features are we going to add to this application we will have two kinds of new features.

00:08.570 --> 00:11.690
One feature block is the unauthenticated part.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.930
So users sign up and sign in and the Arab block of new features is connected to storing data on a server

00:17.960 --> 00:20.380
and for days we will need to be authenticated.

00:20.650 --> 00:26.420
So any unauthenticated plot we're going to add a sign in and sign up page and a side menu which allows

00:26.420 --> 00:28.270
us to sign in and sign up.

00:28.480 --> 00:34.580
Well then once we are FINUCAN it we mainly need to implement this load and save methods or functionality

00:34.580 --> 00:39.730
here so that we can store data on our server and load it or fetch it from there.

00:39.740 --> 00:45.860
Also we will have to side menu in the authenticated part to their desired menu will allow us to log

00:45.860 --> 00:48.940
out or just well go back to our app here.

00:49.100 --> 00:55.280
So these are the two new major blocks we're going to add are two major new features and I want to start

00:55.280 --> 00:58.030
with the authentication part.

00:58.220 --> 01:04.260
Now for days we will all need a couple of new pages to sign up and sign in page and we will add this

01:04.260 --> 01:05.270
side menu.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.110
All things we already learned.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.520
You can of course always go ahead and start working on this.

01:10.520 --> 01:14.670
I will start doing is to get with you in the next lectures.
