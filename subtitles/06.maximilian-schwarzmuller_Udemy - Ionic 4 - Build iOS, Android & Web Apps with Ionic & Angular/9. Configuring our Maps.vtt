In the last lecture we added this Google map your fruity English to Google Maps plug in.

00:06.890 --> 00:10.740
Let's now find through our app and refiner's a little bit more.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.470
And you set location HMO file here.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.990
Well we set up the map.

00:14.990 --> 00:19.060
You'll notice that we started somewhere in the ocean which is not that great.

00:19.100 --> 00:24.410
It's probably not the place where we want to start there for I'm going to overwrite this I'm going to

00:24.410 --> 00:27.100
overwrite the place we're going to start to do this.

00:27.110 --> 00:33.890
I'll go to my set location typescript file to the component behind this template here and I will add

00:33.890 --> 00:41.300
a new property here location which will be of type location the location we created in our own location

00:41.300 --> 00:45.400
model stored in the models folders will make sure to add to US import.

00:45.600 --> 00:51.230
This location should hold the default location we're starting at now this default location could be

00:51.230 --> 00:56.780
set up in the set location page but in the end we want to get this location back to our ad place file.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.500
Right.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.330
So let's go to the place page instead.

01:00.530 --> 01:07.080
And let's also add a location property there they're also using our own location model and therefore

01:07.160 --> 01:11.240
also adding the import here at the top to the models folder.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.840
This will be initialized with a default location with an object which has a latitude.

01:16.840 --> 01:26.200
This is one of the two properties we required and I'll set those two for the DOT 7 6 2 4 3 2 4.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.100
That's really detailed but you can of course choose any location you want that will be the location

01:31.100 --> 01:32.170
in New York City.

01:32.450 --> 01:34.540
And then also set to long at heute.

01:34.550 --> 01:43.440
And this will be minus seven free dot 9 7 5 9 8 9 8 2 7.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.800
So this is the location I want to start with.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.100
Now of course I also need to get this location to my motile then because we're in the wrong page right

01:50.130 --> 01:50.640
now.

01:50.790 --> 01:57.780
So upon opening the mobile here create our past second argument where else at a location property and

01:57.780 --> 02:05.670
past this location so past the location we set up here in the ad place page we have this I'll go back

02:05.670 --> 02:11.260
to the set location page and I want to extract this location therefore I need to inject Neph parents.

02:11.280 --> 02:17.750
We learned this before right how to extract parameterless in a mobile and with Neph perms inject that

02:17.850 --> 02:21.830
and also the imports from ionic angle are added at the top.

02:21.930 --> 02:23.640
I can now simply get this location.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.390
I'll do this here in the constructor.

02:25.440 --> 02:33.000
And at this location equals you this naff parents get location because remember location was the name

02:33.000 --> 02:40.810
of the property we created here in this object we're passing to the modal so if this location gets extracted

02:40.820 --> 02:42.930
we now have a location property.

02:43.220 --> 02:49.460
And with that location property I can again go back to the template the set location page and it will

02:49.460 --> 02:54.530
add property binding Tudor's component because this component has a couple of properties we can buy

02:54.530 --> 03:00.810
in from outside the first property we can bind is the latitude property and latitude.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.720
You guess it expects a number which describes the LED.

03:03.830 --> 03:10.680
Good thing we do have one stored in our location property in the land property.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.190
Then we also need to set a long into it.

03:13.190 --> 03:18.950
So let's also at this property by adding referencing our location and then the long view at the elenchi

03:18.950 --> 03:20.000
property.

03:20.300 --> 03:25.880
Well and finally for now I'll add another property binding to soome and set this to 16.

03:25.890 --> 03:30.590
This is some level we starting at and you can simply play around with this number to find right some

03:30.590 --> 03:32.590
level for your purpose.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.140
Now let's save it with this.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.890
With these changes in place and we should now see that when we opened this motile we start at a different

03:39.890 --> 03:43.750
place here in New York at a different some level.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.720
So with that we changed the default location and we already stored the default location in our app.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.320
Now you can always fine tune just to your needs.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.080
I'm happy with this as it is.

03:54.260 --> 03:59.100
Let's now dive into how we can actually select a place on the map in the next lecture
