Now one thing you might also have noticed is that if you fill all of that out here and you then submit

00:08.180 --> 00:14.150
this that after submitting this devalues of the pickers aren't cleared.

00:14.150 --> 00:19.220
So if I were to submit this now you will still see all the values I picked down there.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.200
So these two preview images on that screen.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.490
Let me show this to you.

00:23.570 --> 00:25.100
They now create a new place.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.930
We still have the old data in there now to clear this.

00:28.970 --> 00:36.060
When we reset our form we in the end one of buying some extra props on our pickers.

00:36.170 --> 00:44.780
So here on the image picker we can add a new input show preview which by default is false let's say

00:44.920 --> 00:49.190
and we add the exact same thing on the location picker.

00:49.190 --> 00:55.650
Here we also add that show preview thing and input in both components needs to be imported from at Anglo

00:55.680 --> 01:02.440
core and then we can go to our HD him El files and show that image here.

01:02.480 --> 01:09.680
Only if we have a much selected if we're not loading and if show preview is true of course we do then

01:09.680 --> 01:11.340
the image picker as well.

01:11.390 --> 01:19.030
So let me go there and on that image on the if check ad to show preview check.

01:19.030 --> 01:21.310
Now how do we set show preview.

01:21.340 --> 01:25.790
We said it from inside our new offer page there.

01:25.900 --> 01:32.800
We include our pickers of course and these pickers can now receive or should now receive the show preview

01:32.800 --> 01:41.110
property and we bind is basically to a check where we see if an image or allocation was picked.

01:41.110 --> 01:42.720
We of course get this from our forum.

01:42.790 --> 01:49.930
There we have that location control and we check if that has a value and that will be true which if

01:49.930 --> 01:56.530
it is set to something other than now and I add the same logic to the image picker here there I add

01:56.530 --> 02:00.970
my image control which I check.

02:00.970 --> 02:08.980
Now while some on that I will also change the sizes here to six so that this is now really centered.

02:09.130 --> 02:13.330
And now we should have nicely center pickers as well which wasn't everything I noticed.

02:13.330 --> 02:17.080
So let's wait for this to load now and let's first of all see.

02:17.220 --> 02:17.520
Yeah.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.390
This is now centered.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.360
Looks better.

02:19.690 --> 02:21.480
And now let's add it is here.

02:21.490 --> 02:28.200
This is another test with any values you want

02:31.450 --> 02:37.520
select the location and I'll pick it on the map here and of course take a picture.

02:37.630 --> 02:38.230
Here I am.

02:38.230 --> 02:42.030
But I will actually take that from the image picker and take Munich.

02:42.030 --> 02:48.580
And now if I submit this does works and if we now create another new place this is empty again we don't

02:48.580 --> 02:54.040
show the image but now the problem is we also don't show the button reason for data that we didn't clear

02:54.040 --> 02:58.560
our selected image or silhouette or select location.

02:58.580 --> 03:01.550
Now you've got a couple of different options here to solve this.

03:01.720 --> 03:06.360
You could manage these selected image and location outside of these pictures.

03:06.370 --> 03:11.500
So did you just admit any value that was picked and managed to add value then and then you offer page

03:11.530 --> 03:18.040
and pass it back in here as a property or are you at the end you on changes hook and check whenever

03:18.040 --> 03:25.250
show preview changes so that you will clear your selected image there after or what it will do for us

03:25.250 --> 03:30.200
here as well we just have to make sure the button appears when show preview is false.

03:30.290 --> 03:36.920
So here I will add a and Jeff check and show it as if we don't have a selected image or if we don't

03:36.920 --> 03:41.840
have show previews set to true.

03:41.870 --> 03:42.790
So this is a check.

03:42.800 --> 03:50.190
I will now add here and of course also in your location picture on my eye button like this Deford is

03:50.190 --> 03:54.750
reloads and we can enter more dummy data you're with more dummy dates

03:57.590 --> 04:07.150
select the location on a map take a picture I will take the file picture submit.

04:07.170 --> 04:09.310
This looks good.

04:09.420 --> 04:16.350
And now if we go back here we again can pick on the map and so on so these networks again as it did

04:16.680 --> 04:17.650
before.

04:17.670 --> 04:21.840
Here I am.

04:21.860 --> 04:29.720
So this is now the finished front and part of these papers I hope you'll learn a lot about the different

04:29.720 --> 04:37.520
ways of interacting with native API is even in the browser thanks to the P.W. elements and capacitor.

04:37.520 --> 04:43.430
Now of course let's take that image and let's also upload it to a server so that we store it there as

04:43.430 --> 04:44.030
well.
