It's really good that in due course application we're now able to fetch user input and obviously a fetching

00:09.670 --> 00:13.780
user input is something you will need in a lot of your applications.

00:13.810 --> 00:17.000
Or basically every application you're creating as well.

00:17.290 --> 00:21.430
But once that user input is fetched what do we do with it.

00:21.430 --> 00:28.120
Well that will be basically the focus of this module will dive into managing and using state in our

00:28.120 --> 00:29.380
application.

00:29.380 --> 00:34.750
And that means we're not just focusing on getting user input but also doing something with it so that

00:34.750 --> 00:38.230
somewhere in the end we're also outputting something useful.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.200
And for Dad.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.450
Well first of all have a brief look at what state actually is.

00:43.450 --> 00:50.470
What do a mean with the term state thereafter we'll have a look at how we save that user input we're

00:50.470 --> 00:56.740
fetching fruit of forms we added in the last course module and we'll have a look at how we can output

00:56.740 --> 01:03.190
our state so how we can adjust our application to take that data the user entered into account.
