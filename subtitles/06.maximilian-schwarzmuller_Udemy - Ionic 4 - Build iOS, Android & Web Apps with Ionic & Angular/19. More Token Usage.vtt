00:02.230 --> 00:07.840
So working with the places seems to work now it's time to work on the bookings here and use the token

00:07.840 --> 00:09.750
theater as well.

00:09.760 --> 00:15.760
Now let's start in that booking there we're getting the user I.D. which is all right now stored as in

00:15.760 --> 00:21.300
a variable fetched user I.D. in this step here

00:25.490 --> 00:31.640
or actually after we know that it exists because I'm not immediately create my new booking here.

00:31.760 --> 00:37.560
Instead there I will return this off service token because I need that too.

00:37.790 --> 00:45.980
This of course means that essentially all that code down there is removed from this switch map.

00:45.980 --> 00:52.490
Instead I take one here because for my token subscription I also only want to get one value and then

00:52.490 --> 00:55.980
I add a new switch map where I get dead token.

00:56.270 --> 01:02.020
And then here I now create my new booking user I.D. Now fetched user I.D..

01:02.030 --> 01:06.490
That is why I did stored the user I.D. in there so that we can also access it down here.

01:07.010 --> 01:08.480
And now just as before

01:11.500 --> 01:22.050
we add that of query parameter and add our token here now for canceling a booking I'll of course want

01:22.050 --> 01:23.100
to do the same thing

01:26.540 --> 01:37.250
so a year I will return this off service token add pipe and first of all take one that's important then

01:37.250 --> 01:44.870
add the switch map where I get this token and index which map I will then return a call to this delete

01:45.140 --> 01:49.100
method at the end here as before.

01:49.270 --> 01:56.480
All set my token equal to the token I'm getting from this subscription where I fetch one value.

01:56.890 --> 02:03.460
And then here I add to other methods I had in the pipe method two dead one pipe or two the one observable

02:03.460 --> 02:09.070
change we're setting up here now and with that booking places and canceling bookings hopefully all the

02:09.070 --> 02:11.380
works let's give it a try.

02:11.530 --> 02:18.100
Let's go to the book of all places and let's add a booking here for Munich select a random date.

02:18.220 --> 02:23.700
Maximilian Schwartz Mueller.

02:24.570 --> 02:28.920
I'll bring two friends and I'll go with the default date here.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.660
And now if I have a look at my bookings

02:33.380 --> 02:37.870
I seem to have a problem a year on authorized.

02:38.060 --> 02:39.980
Let's have a look what's wrong.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.480
Well we have fetch bookings.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.430
I simply overlooked that.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.810
Of course here we also want to get our token.

02:47.840 --> 02:55.490
So here where I have that user I.D. same trick as before all stored dead in the fetched user I.D. variable

02:55.490 --> 02:59.590
here so that I can use it everywhere in all steps of this observable chain.

03:00.170 --> 03:02.820
So I'll set fetched user I.D. equal to the user idea.

03:02.850 --> 03:06.610
God once I know that it exists so often as if check.

03:06.830 --> 03:20.840
And then here I'll return this off service token not this bookings but this of service token wrap this

03:20.840 --> 03:28.490
function call here add a new step here and only take one value off that token subscription add and you

03:28.490 --> 03:37.340
switch map where I do get that token and then in here I return this HDP request where I do indeed use

03:37.340 --> 03:47.720
my fetched user I.D. now and where I now simply add one extra query parameter of equal to token and

03:47.720 --> 03:55.470
important debt as an percent off equal to token at the end and now fetching the bookings should work

03:55.470 --> 03:58.960
again of course maybe we should have added an error alert here.

03:58.980 --> 04:01.520
Feel free to improve the app by doing that.

04:01.530 --> 04:05.420
Now here it gives gives me that booking but tried to cancel it.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.960
That also works and with that I'd say we add it off indication to this app.
