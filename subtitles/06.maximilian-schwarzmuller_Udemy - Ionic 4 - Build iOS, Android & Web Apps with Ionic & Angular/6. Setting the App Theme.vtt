00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.620
So in the last lecture I challenge you to change the theming on your own.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.600
Go back to the last lecture to the very end of it to get my full instruction.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.490
Now I want to change the theming together with you.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.870
I did show you the color codes codes I'm planning to use and the last with you at the end of it.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.830
So now I can go to my theme folder to the variables start s.c.s asphalt to change as global styles variable

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.860
here and there we get our colorist map.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.750
Now I actually want to override two color codes here.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:45.090
The primary and secondary color code for the primary I pick B C 7 e 40 which is a Nye's brownish color

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.410
and a secondary color is brighter or a different green color I should say 7 A.D. 6 1 D.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.000
So that's still a green color but a kind of different tone of green with that if we now save this and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
trigger the recompilation by for example changing something and some other file because changing that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.690
file on its own won't trigger it.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.470
You'll see that now we indeed get a different theming.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.870
So this is now set.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.040
Let's now think about our next steps in the next lecture
