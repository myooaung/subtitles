00:02.100 --> 00:07.770
With all the icons and splash screens added let's deploy the applications and let's start with Android

00:08.740 --> 00:09.450
for that.

00:09.480 --> 00:15.090
Was it your Android still your project and their under built.

00:15.210 --> 00:20.300
You can generate a signed bundle or a P.K. which is what we need to do here.

00:20.370 --> 00:23.730
No leave the default Android app bundle checked and click next.

00:23.730 --> 00:26.900
Now you need a key store where you can create a new one.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.430
Choose a path for at Keast or first of all and that can simply be your project path which is what I'll

00:32.430 --> 00:33.900
choose here.

00:34.110 --> 00:37.990
So all added My key store here in my project path.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.100
Assign a password one that you should of course remember

00:45.190 --> 00:48.930
you can leave the is here as it is and assign a number.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.350
Password here

00:55.300 --> 00:56.470
leaves the validity.

00:56.470 --> 01:00.140
Then enter some data about yourself.

01:00.160 --> 01:05.200
This is all data is basically used for assigning the app and signing is a process that basically makes

01:05.200 --> 01:07.810
sure that you are the owner of the app.

01:07.810 --> 01:15.990
You are the creator and you are the only one to change that app or to manage that app the exact data

01:15.990 --> 01:21.180
you fill in here of course doesn't matter but it should be true because that is what you kind of use

01:21.180 --> 01:26.520
for assigning and what you kind of leave as a footprint here.

01:26.770 --> 01:30.110
And with all that you got a new key store.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.770
You can leave everything as it is here.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.520
And then choose a build type which should be released and finished it.

01:36.570 --> 01:41.270
And what this will now do is it will take your application and put it into an API K so into a bundle

01:41.270 --> 01:49.370
which you can upload to the Play Store and sign it with your data to add some proof that you are a creator

01:49.600 --> 01:52.700
of this application and to kind of link it to you.

01:52.730 --> 02:02.580
You could say so let's wait for it is built to finish and once this is done you can upload this part

02:02.600 --> 02:09.390
and you can search for a Google placed or console to find that management area for you as a developer.

02:10.520 --> 02:16.370
There you need to sign in with your Google account and then you need to accept the developer agreement

02:16.430 --> 02:21.930
and pay a one time registration fee which isn't too high it's no subscription it's just one time.

02:21.950 --> 02:28.520
This is basically there to make sure that only people that have at least some serious intentions release

02:28.580 --> 02:30.280
apps to the App Store.

02:30.290 --> 02:37.080
Now here I am locked in after accepting the agreement and paying that fee.

02:37.080 --> 02:43.410
And here you can now click Create application choose your evil language give it a name like paper B

02:43.410 --> 02:49.410
and B or whatever the name of your application of causes click Create here and then here you need to

02:49.410 --> 02:57.470
fill out information about that application upload some images and basically build that page.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.950
Your app will have in the App Store and of course therefore you will definitely want to add information

03:01.950 --> 03:04.980
here that makes people want to download it.

03:05.230 --> 03:13.830
Now what you of course need to do also is under app releases here you can upload a new app release for

03:13.830 --> 03:18.030
dad go to production track and click manage create a release

03:20.880 --> 03:21.840
continue here

03:25.540 --> 03:28.160
and now browse files and upload your AP okay.

03:28.180 --> 03:38.000
Now where do you find that in your project folder under Android app release release and that is your

03:38.360 --> 03:44.730
app bundle and now does gets upload here is processed and thereafter once you all have finished the

03:44.740 --> 03:52.170
rest here you can publish this app bundle and that is how you deploy your app to Android.
