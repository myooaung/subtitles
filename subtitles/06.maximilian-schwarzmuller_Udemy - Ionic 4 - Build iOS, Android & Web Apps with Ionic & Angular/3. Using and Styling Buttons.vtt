00:02.210 --> 00:08.180
The first component or element I only cruise ships with into which I want to dive a little bit deeper

00:08.300 --> 00:13.130
are buttons soiled and the appropriate part here and the components documentation.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.400
And you can do that too.

00:14.420 --> 00:17.720
But no worries we're not going to read the documentation together.

00:17.720 --> 00:21.200
That would be pretty boring and not really the point of a video.

00:21.380 --> 00:28.430
I will create a new project and play around with some of those configurations and how to use buttons

00:28.520 --> 00:29.370
in there.

00:30.350 --> 00:37.820
I'm back into a brand new blank project created with iconic start project name blank dash dash.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.720
We too.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.360
And I want to start with buttons by having a closer look at Buttons.

00:44.360 --> 00:49.340
So let's add a button to our content here in the home component's template.

00:49.610 --> 00:52.320
And I can say a normal button as a caption or whatever you like.

00:52.340 --> 00:56.520
And I also want to add a click listener on Clearlake.

00:56.630 --> 00:57.670
Very very simple.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.130
Let's copy this and add it to our home that the fall the of file.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.720
And here I simply want to console log clicked.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.260
Very very simple.

01:08.510 --> 01:11.690
Now we saved doesn't have a look at our running application.

01:11.690 --> 01:14.340
You will see that it won't look very amazing.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.790
Diesel's the button.

01:15.860 --> 01:21.250
And if you click on it we can see that it gets clicked in the console but we don't get any visual feedback.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.630
Anyways it looks very very ugly.

01:23.900 --> 01:28.250
So it is not how we use buttons and we learned how to style them more pretty.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.570
If we go to the template again.

01:30.710 --> 01:36.760
And now we add a simple directive to the Spartan iron button would be the directive we need.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.470
And once we had this we turned this normal button.

01:39.470 --> 01:45.880
Keep in mind it's the normal HVM all button element here into an eye two button which means it has this

01:45.920 --> 01:49.700
nice restyling we get the visual feedback and so on.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.110
So now we have a pretty button.

01:52.110 --> 01:57.470
Another important takeaway is that we can of course also add color attribute as we can add it to pretty

01:57.470 --> 01:59.910
much all ionic two elements.

01:59.970 --> 02:05.870
And for example we can set this to secondary to gift us button the secondary color instead of the default

02:05.900 --> 02:06.950
primary color.

02:06.950 --> 02:08.540
So now we get a green button.

02:08.540 --> 02:15.930
And of course you can use all the colors you set up in the variables folder here and the color map.

02:15.950 --> 02:20.850
So these are different ways of configuring the button but we can do more with it.

02:20.900 --> 02:28.940
Let's copy this button and edit year and on name this there's another button and what I want to do here

02:28.940 --> 02:34.640
is I'll get rid of the color but instead I want to show you different ways of styling this button you

02:34.640 --> 02:41.900
could say for example right now the first part use the default style but we can also use the outline

02:41.900 --> 02:42.890
style.

02:42.890 --> 02:47.340
Now if we add outline to our button this directive here you will see.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.320
Now we only see the outline.

02:49.350 --> 02:52.580
We don't see the background except for when clicking on it.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.330
So we get this visual feedback.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.100
And this might be another style you want to have in your application.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.960
There is yet another style though.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.750
Declarator style by adding clear instead of outline what I'll do is I'll get rid of the complete border

03:05.840 --> 03:06.920
and the background.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.430
And now we only get this links like view.

03:09.440 --> 03:18.200
You might notice from Iowa s as a side note if you change to Android you still have idea the style but

03:18.200 --> 03:21.430
you get a bit of background feedback when clicking on it.

03:21.620 --> 03:25.100
So these are just different styles 40 different platforms.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.120
I own it will automatically add.

03:27.470 --> 03:32.540
So these are different ways of styling the button and number style we have is round.

03:32.540 --> 03:36.400
Now you might already be able to guess what round will do right.

03:36.410 --> 03:39.650
It gives you this rounded button here with rounded corners.

03:39.650 --> 03:42.170
So all of very nice style.

03:42.230 --> 03:44.610
So these are different styles you may use.

03:44.630 --> 03:48.110
You can also change the way but this should get positioned.

03:48.140 --> 03:56.360
For example you can add block number block will do is it will turn those buttons from the inline element

03:56.480 --> 04:04.310
to block element which means it gets added to the flow of elements in the H DML document and Dom and

04:04.310 --> 04:08.560
it will be treated as a normal block element like a death for example.

04:08.600 --> 04:14.560
Hence taking all the available with no longer being placed in line with our inline elements.

04:14.570 --> 04:16.000
This is why it is button chumped.

04:16.010 --> 04:19.670
The second line and now takes up the full width.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.420
Now sometimes you also want to have the button stretch over the full width.

04:24.690 --> 04:30.780
Now the padding here will of course always be respected because that shows how the well how your page

04:30.840 --> 04:31.860
is style.

04:31.880 --> 04:36.270
Now if you remove the padding here and let's all the remove that rounded looks and says will look a

04:36.270 --> 04:41.610
bit strange you will see that now the button stretched over the full width.

04:41.610 --> 04:47.900
However it does still have these rounded corners here which makes it look a bit strange.

04:47.910 --> 04:54.480
Sometimes you want that look where it really takes the full width and where you instead add padding

04:54.480 --> 04:57.600
or margin to individual items instead of the whole content.

04:57.600 --> 05:03.490
As we did before but still doesn't look great with the rounded corners for cases like these.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.850
You can add full instead of block.

05:06.060 --> 05:09.600
So this will do the same as block but also get rid of the border.

05:09.660 --> 05:12.470
Hence you now don't have any rounded corners.

05:12.480 --> 05:19.640
Now it really takes up the full width and it looks more like a natural stop in your element and fall

05:19.760 --> 05:24.250
apart simply stretching from left to right without any edges.

05:24.540 --> 05:28.300
So it is an average style you might be interested in using.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.600
Now I will add padding again.

05:31.490 --> 05:34.650
And change fall back to block here.

05:35.470 --> 05:40.750
So there we are back to you look where we simply have a blog item stretching up for or default with

05:40.930 --> 05:43.920
respecting the padding of the content of course.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.920
And I want to go into sizes of buttons now.

05:49.210 --> 05:53.420
I already explained that you can add small for example.

05:53.430 --> 05:58.510
Well and as you might be able to guess small simply makes us a small button if you don't add anything

05:58.510 --> 06:06.730
you have to medium size button and you can also add large groups like this and this will just make sure

06:07.030 --> 06:08.770
that now you have D.

06:08.860 --> 06:11.400
Well very very big button here.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.470
That's all nice.

06:13.480 --> 06:18.610
More important is however or very interesting too I should say is however what you can do inside of

06:18.610 --> 06:19.090
that button.

06:19.120 --> 06:25.570
So here we we just have a number of buttons right now having a text as of course straightforwards scenario

06:25.570 --> 06:29.900
something you will use a lot but you can add more than text inside there.

06:30.100 --> 06:35.410
For example you can add an icon so I can inside of the button.

06:35.410 --> 06:40.950
If you do this let's give it the home I can use.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.960
However it should be the attribute of the icon of course.

06:43.960 --> 06:50.540
Now if we save this you will see the home where symbol inside of that button.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.090
It's ok.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.610
However it doesn't look great.

06:54.940 --> 06:58.810
You can improve this by adding a number attribute to the button.

06:58.900 --> 07:04.630
I can only attribute that which will inform my onic that this button only holds I can.

07:04.630 --> 07:09.940
Now you can see the icon is a bit bigger and therefore it looks nicer and less strange.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.480
Of course you might also consider not making this a block button so that it isn't as broad or hest is

07:16.480 --> 07:20.910
full of with which might also make more sense when using Eichen.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.290
Now what if you want to combine Iken and text.

07:23.280 --> 07:30.400
Though let's add some text here like home which makes sense if we have a look at the I can if we do

07:30.400 --> 07:31.630
it like this.

07:31.840 --> 07:36.690
That looks all right but you can also configure where it does.

07:36.730 --> 07:38.460
I can show said.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.640
So let's remove.

07:39.670 --> 07:43.650
I can only to begin with because well it isn't the only I can write.

07:43.650 --> 07:46.810
We do have I can add text if removed.

07:47.130 --> 07:54.940
It looks worse because now the text sits directly next to the Iken so it might not look like an improvement.

07:55.090 --> 07:57.100
But this is because we're using it wrong.

07:57.280 --> 08:04.810
If you are mixing icons and text you should not use no configuration.

08:04.990 --> 08:07.110
Instead we should define a word.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.570
I can actually yes.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.450
Is it on the left on the right.

08:10.510 --> 08:16.630
You can say I can lead for example to and for my on it to that you want to replace the I can on the

08:16.630 --> 08:18.430
left of the text.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.060
And now you see it nicely centers it word easily.

08:22.090 --> 08:23.980
It has this nice spacing.

08:24.070 --> 08:28.420
It looks very good and of course the same is true if you set this to.

08:28.420 --> 08:33.320
I can write and therefore Oreilles of course move the position of the Iken down there.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.740
If you do this now it looks all right.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.230
In this scenario too.

08:37.480 --> 08:42.870
So these are different ways of configuring buttons and there are of course even more.

08:42.880 --> 08:49.900
Again I really want to guide you to have a look at the documentation here to learn more about user's

08:50.200 --> 08:53.560
usage of buttons and how to combine it with other components.

08:53.590 --> 08:58.810
And again we will of course use more buttons for this course too.

08:58.810 --> 09:04.270
I found it important to give you this introduction though to inform you about the different ways of

09:04.270 --> 09:09.410
styling a button since buttons are such an important element in any application.
