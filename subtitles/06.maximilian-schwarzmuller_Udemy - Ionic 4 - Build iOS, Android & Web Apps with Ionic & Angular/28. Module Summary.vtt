00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.400
So in this section we took the application from the last course section and enhanced it.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.350
We added authentication to allow the user to create an account and then sign in.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.160
And then with that account we allow the user to store recipes on the server.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.530
And of course all fetched him from there.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.850
So now you should be able to confidently implement such features in your next app.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.170
You saw me use firebase in this section here.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.860
And of course you might not use firebase in which case the authentication workflow will differ a bit

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.240
but you saw how to use HTP and that of course would also allow you to reach out to your authentication

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.130
restful service where you'd send user data and back get back a token which you then manually store and

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.830
fetch.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.080
So that is really very similar to what you learn here.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.040
And with that you should have a solid understanding on how it generally works how you can navigate the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.960
user to the right part of your app depending on whether he's authenticated or not and how to implement

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.340
such features in your next project.
