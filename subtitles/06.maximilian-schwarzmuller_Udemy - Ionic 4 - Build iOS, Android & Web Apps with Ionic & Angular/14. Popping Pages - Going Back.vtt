We already get a nice application to CD I on a two basic functionality and I recognize that we have

00:10.740 --> 00:17.090
basis year as a tile and not basics but I guess it's also the basis of any aler to app of any ironic

00:17.090 --> 00:17.890
to app.

00:18.170 --> 00:23.600
We can go to our users and pass different data and we can always go back with the back button.

00:23.600 --> 00:30.650
Now what does if you want to go back with some other button let's say or you want to trigger the popping

00:30.650 --> 00:33.440
process of the current page programmatically.

00:33.440 --> 00:39.610
So for example here on the individual user page you could have a confirmed button to confirm some changes

00:39.620 --> 00:43.160
and of course you will have apps actually doing that later.

00:43.370 --> 00:48.850
And when you click on confirm you want to go back without having to click the back button.

00:48.860 --> 00:53.090
So let's implement this in the application.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.260
I will go to my user page and here below.

00:56.270 --> 01:03.830
Hi I'm my name I will add a new button at the end button directive to make it look nice and simply say

01:04.160 --> 01:05.300
confirm.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.440
Now upon clicking on this.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.960
I want to go back so I will execute on go back.

01:11.960 --> 01:21.200
Now here in my body in the typescript code I therefore need to implement DE on go back method in order

01:21.200 --> 01:22.240
to go back.

01:22.310 --> 01:29.750
I again need the nav controller because always keep in mind DNF control is declasse responsible for

01:29.780 --> 01:35.720
everything which has to do with pushing or popping or changing any pages on this navigations stack.

01:35.990 --> 01:43.490
So let's check the nav controller type nav controller and make sure to add the import from ionic angular.

01:43.910 --> 01:50.990
And with this inject into your in on go back I can access my nav controller and instead of pushing I

01:50.990 --> 01:55.800
now call pop and this will simply pop off the top most page.

01:55.820 --> 02:02.060
It always pops off the top most page which of course results in me going back one page because all these

02:02.060 --> 02:05.920
Keep in mind what you're seeing on the screen is the top most page.

02:05.930 --> 02:12.590
So if you remove this page while you go back to the last page on the stack we can see this in action

02:12.590 --> 02:13.910
when saving this.

02:14.300 --> 02:21.200
Let's go to the app then users click on a user and click on confirm you see you get the same effect

02:21.230 --> 02:23.090
as when you click the back button.

02:23.090 --> 02:26.200
So in the background the back button does exactly the same thing.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.580
It simply pops off the top page.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.900
And we're doing the same with the confirm button no.

02:31.130 --> 02:36.410
So this is now working and it's always playing this nice animation by default which is cool.

02:36.410 --> 02:38.560
So with this we're popping this page.

02:38.630 --> 02:41.630
But what if we actually want to go back to the root page.

02:41.630 --> 02:49.470
So to this page here and not just to the users page or we can also do this we can instead of using this

02:49.470 --> 02:57.560
snap control or pop Eckstine AF controller and there's a number Mefford we can access on this controller.

02:57.650 --> 03:00.430
It's called PAUP to root.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.920
Now as the name applies this will pop off.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.610
Remove all pages on the stack except for the root page.

03:08.720 --> 03:15.020
So it will always take us back to the bottom most page on the stack which of course is the root page.

03:15.020 --> 03:21.500
And as a side note you can pop off the root page so you can't empty your stack because that would basically

03:21.500 --> 03:23.430
crash your application.

03:23.450 --> 03:29.180
So if this change in place after saving it it will recompile and reload the app and once did reload.

03:29.290 --> 03:36.260
If you click on users and then confirm you'll see you're taken back to your root page and not just to

03:36.260 --> 03:38.330
the in-between users page.

03:38.450 --> 03:43.980
So this is a novel way of navigating around and how to get back to previous pages
