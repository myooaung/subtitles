00:02.520 --> 00:10.910
So let's build up on our knowledge gained from when what is true or false and therefore now let's add

00:10.970 --> 00:12.720
a new property here.

00:12.770 --> 00:17.960
I'll name it use picker and the dad by default is false.

00:18.130 --> 00:29.800
And here I'll check if this platform is mobile and at the same time the platform is not hybrid.

00:29.890 --> 00:36.970
Then we know we're running on a desktop device and Dad would also be the case if I wrap this in racquets

00:36.980 --> 00:46.660
here if and therefore that's not your case to that first check if this platform is desktop if that is

00:46.660 --> 00:51.820
true we can all rely on this being executed on a desktop device in the browser there.

00:51.880 --> 00:58.090
So if we are on a desktop device now no matter if you are viewing it as a normal desktop mode like this

00:58.390 --> 01:04.450
or if we're previewing it in this mobile mode like this will now make it into this if check here and

01:04.450 --> 01:04.810
there.

01:04.810 --> 01:11.350
I want to set this use picker equal to true because then I want to use a file picker instead of trying

01:11.350 --> 01:12.610
to access the camera.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.480
So let me now go to the ad template here and there.

01:17.500 --> 01:26.140
Outside of that div I want to render a new input a normal input not an eye and input which will be of

01:26.140 --> 01:32.050
type file which is a default file it's a default HQ criminal element a default attribute for that element

01:32.680 --> 01:39.040
I only will render this if use picker is true and then I'll give it as a reference file picker so that

01:39.040 --> 01:45.490
I can interact with that from inside the typescript code and all register a change listener here on

01:45.670 --> 01:51.060
file chosen or whatever you want and I'll forward deviant data we get here.

01:51.130 --> 01:57.430
So the idea here is that we can fall back to a normal file picker in cases where we can't access to

01:57.430 --> 02:08.640
camera and I will actually now also go to my SPSS code and select that input where we have that type

02:08.670 --> 02:14.940
equals file attributes so that file picker we just edit and set display to non so that it's still part

02:14.940 --> 02:20.370
of the Dom but we can't see it because this file picker should not be clickable directly.

02:20.400 --> 02:26.910
Instead I want to click it for the user when the user clicks take picture when the app runs on a device

02:26.910 --> 02:35.700
where we can't access the camera and therefore now let's go to on page image and if we are in here so

02:35.700 --> 02:42.930
if the plugin is not available or if this use picker is true which means we are running on a platform

02:42.930 --> 02:49.770
where we don't assume that the camera is available then I want to click that file picture for the user

02:50.700 --> 02:52.370
for this I just need to get access to it.

02:52.440 --> 03:01.020
So let's use a view child for that and there I gave that file picture a local reference of file picture

03:01.110 --> 03:06.720
so we can pass that to add to view child you child needs to be imported from and Angela core of course

03:07.260 --> 03:12.570
that here we can store it is in a property named file picker or whatever you want to name it and to

03:12.570 --> 03:22.240
type here will be element ref that will eventually resolve to an HD him El input element and therefore

03:22.300 --> 03:27.850
this is more like a file pick a ref I guess so to reference to the file picture now we can use that

03:27.850 --> 03:34.250
file pick a ref to access to native element so here and this a check we can access this file pick a

03:34.250 --> 03:42.520
ref native element and execute a click and this will therefore open that file picture or do whatever

03:42.520 --> 03:44.910
to the fall picker normally does.

03:44.980 --> 03:49.180
Now we just need to add that on file chosen method here as well.

03:49.180 --> 03:57.250
So let me add this method down here and there I will get some event data which is of type event and

03:57.370 --> 04:05.850
for now we'll just console log that event data here okay so let's save that and let's run ionic serve

04:05.880 --> 04:12.780
and there on our desktop device we should now indeed use that file picker so here in the browser let's

04:12.780 --> 04:18.630
click take picture and now indeed that file picture opens here where I can pick an image of course right

04:18.660 --> 04:23.790
now I don't see that image here because we haven't added any logic for that but we see that event data

04:23.790 --> 04:31.290
that gets printed here and indeed the aerials see that on the target element you will have a files property

04:31.290 --> 04:36.540
which holds a reference to the file picture here which is the image I just picked so we can build up

04:36.540 --> 04:40.980
on this and now retrieve our files from there and use stead in this application.
