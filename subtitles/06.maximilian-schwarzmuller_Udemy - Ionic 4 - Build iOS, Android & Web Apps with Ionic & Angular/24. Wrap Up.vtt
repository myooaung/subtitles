00:02.160 --> 00:06.300
So this was a pretty large module but you learned a lot about navigation and routing.

00:06.360 --> 00:13.440
You learned how to add tabs, how to implement that forward backwards navigation with the different approaches,

00:13.440 --> 00:15.510
how to use that nav controller,

00:15.510 --> 00:21.330
how to open a modal which is not loaded through the Angular router but still occupies a significant

00:21.330 --> 00:23.040
part of the space, on mobile

00:23.040 --> 00:25.140
the entire view, on web

00:25.140 --> 00:27.070
it's a part of the page,

00:27.180 --> 00:32.580
there we get this nice looking modal out of the box which is also pretty nice, that we got the right

00:32.580 --> 00:36.120
styling for different device sizes without us needing to do anything.

00:36.930 --> 00:42.630
You learned how to pass data around in your modal and you also learned how to add such a side drawer so

00:42.630 --> 00:49.140
that you can switch to different parts in your application, logout and also have the right behavior

00:49.140 --> 00:56.070
of the menu depending on where you click what. These are all core tools you will need in any and really

00:56.070 --> 00:59.480
in any application you're building with Ionic and Angular.

00:59.590 --> 01:05.860
You'll need tabs and or a side menu and definitely that forward backward navigation.

01:05.910 --> 01:10.890
So these are things you definitely have to know and understand which is why I spend a lot of time on

01:10.890 --> 01:11.760
this module.

01:11.820 --> 01:17.370
Now we will move on, we'll work more on the different components we can use, how we can configure them,

01:17.370 --> 01:22.050
how we can make them look good and we'll gradually add more and more logic to the application.
