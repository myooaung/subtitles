Sometimes in your applications you need to know the width or height of your device because you maybe

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.080
want to adjust some things depending on that or you were interested in the question whether the user

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.200
is currently viewing Graben portrait or landscape mode while using those platform injection.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.820
We also already used to determine which operating system running on.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.570
We can also learn which orientation our device has or which width and height.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.100
So for example I can simply log this platform and then here I got the height method which will you guess

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.340
and give me back the height of the device.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.100
Let's do the same for with and then I also got some other helpful methods here with this platform is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.000
landscape well here I can check if I'm in landscape mode and we do have the same for portrait.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.070
So with these four methods height width Lenn it's landscape and is portrayed we get powerful tools of

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.370
really determining how the APIs getting viewed and potentially rearranging things showing something

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.320
different whatever we want to do.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.090
So let's save this with vi on Xserve already running two seaters in the Live application.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.910
And I'm just building on on the last lecture where you had a look at the operating system and if it's

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.340
an iPhone here you see the console log.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.330
So this is width and height and then this was the log for is landscape this is false.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.610
And for as portrayed we see true now it's changed is by rotating to the wise and reloading the app.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.420
Now you see the width and height of course swopped and so did the values for its landscape and is portrait

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.540
now as landscape is of course true.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.550
So this is how you may utilize these efforts here to adjust your application depending on how the users

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.280
viewing your application and how much space you actually have to use.
