Thus far we covered a lot of important basics you'll need for building ionic angular applications.

00:09.130 --> 00:14.350
What we didn't cover thus far is how we can make sure that the app really looks the way we want it to

00:14.350 --> 00:14.770
look.

00:14.770 --> 00:19.810
Sure we had a look at the ionic grid which helps us with positioning items and laying out the page.

00:20.140 --> 00:26.860
But what about colors and general settings like the font or the background of our toolbar.

00:26.860 --> 00:32.380
What about all these things how can we adjust the app to look the way we wanted to look.

00:32.470 --> 00:38.650
To answer this question in this module we'll have a look at styling and theming in ionic angular apps

00:38.740 --> 00:45.040
and specifically we'll dive into you which tools I order in general gives us when it comes to styling

00:45.490 --> 00:54.220
how we can set and use a theme in ionic apps and a theme is things like the colors the font ends on

00:54.820 --> 01:01.930
how we can use C as as variables to our advantage and what see us as variables actually are and how

01:01.930 --> 01:06.810
custom CSX or in this project actually SAS but doesn't really matter.

01:06.850 --> 01:09.110
Styles fit into this whole big picture.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.660
Let's explore our options there.
