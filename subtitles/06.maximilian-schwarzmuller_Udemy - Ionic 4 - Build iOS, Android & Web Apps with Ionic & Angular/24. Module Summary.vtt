00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:09.020
So in this module you learn a lot about eye on it too and it's basics you'll learn and how the project

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.470
structure works how it looks like how an ironic application gets started and is connected to an angle

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.100
or two application.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.030
You also learned what pages are how they work how they are connected to components how navigation works

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.270
and where to find out more about all those building components how to style your application and much

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.880
more.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.240
Now these are these solid fundamentals.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.630
Let's now take them and build up on them in the next section in the first application we're going to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.810
build so it is real EPPER now building using those fundamentals using actual components so that you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.540
can actually see those things in action and how that works in a real app.
