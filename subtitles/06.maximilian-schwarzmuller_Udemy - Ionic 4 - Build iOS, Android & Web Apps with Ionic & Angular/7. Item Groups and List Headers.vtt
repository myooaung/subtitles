Sometimes you want to group your list you want to have some categories in your list.

00:07.570 --> 00:14.080
This is very easy to achieve with I on it too for it isn't going to copy my eye and last year and I'm

00:14.080 --> 00:21.520
getting rid of my button and for the first item I'm going to say Apple or Apple's pleural then I'm going

00:21.520 --> 00:27.350
to add another I an item where I say Abbo Cato's I hope I pronounced this correctly.

00:27.430 --> 00:29.830
So I got fruit in my list.

00:29.860 --> 00:36.600
I also might have additional items that say bananas and berries.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.400
So let's quickly add those.

00:39.610 --> 00:45.520
Now we clearly have two items with an A at the beginning and then two with a B.

00:45.670 --> 00:51.480
If I say would like this and we have a look at this running application we see our list here and there's

00:51.490 --> 00:57.220
nothing wrong with it but it would be nice to have like a header above the apples and avocados and a

00:57.220 --> 01:01.470
B head are above the bananas and berries to achieve this.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.580
I'm going to change this iron laced into another component.

01:05.810 --> 01:14.480
And I and I Tim group now I asked a name kind of tells or implies this is the element we're ionic expects

01:14.530 --> 01:19.130
to have multiple groups of items you could say and you do what.

01:19.130 --> 01:21.100
Divide those groups.

01:21.190 --> 01:24.880
I'm going to places in one line just for to make it easier to see.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.290
You divide these groups by adding up.

01:27.340 --> 01:30.460
I am item divider.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.040
Today's item group.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.160
So this is a new component.

01:34.540 --> 01:41.650
And here I simply type some text which I want to display let's say because this group should only contain

01:41.650 --> 01:43.300
items with an A.

01:43.390 --> 01:50.040
With that I'm going to copy that and add another divider after avocadoes before bananas and give us

01:50.080 --> 01:52.890
a B since the next room starts with B.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.200
You can of course enter any text you want here.

01:55.270 --> 02:00.520
Now if this if I save this and let it recompile you quickly see here you go.

02:00.520 --> 02:06.310
Now we get those nice dividers inside the file list dividing this list up and therefore making it a

02:06.310 --> 02:13.350
bit easier to read or to see where our items belong and where they are.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.900
The theory behind this.

02:14.930 --> 02:24.310
So we have multiple item dividers dividing our item group into subgroups or into multiple sections you

02:24.310 --> 02:29.800
could say sometimes you also want to have a different way of dividing this up.

02:29.950 --> 02:36.340
You don't want to have to read I an item group with the dividers which leads to our section sitting

02:36.340 --> 02:39.390
very close to each other since it's all in one list.

02:39.460 --> 02:46.490
But instead you might want to have a header inside of your list which looks and works a bit differently.

02:46.810 --> 02:52.230
For this I could add a new list and list again not a group.

02:52.540 --> 03:02.570
And then there I have a couple of items like like say tracking and thereafter personal images and there

03:02.570 --> 03:05.040
could be options in the menu let's say.

03:05.340 --> 03:13.080
So a fitting title for that would be nice and we can add such a list header by adding the ion list header

03:13.170 --> 03:20.070
component here in there we can again specify any text you want let's say privacy.

03:20.370 --> 03:27.000
And by doing this if I save this you see now I added this nice header which looks differently than the

03:27.000 --> 03:29.540
divider is here in this one list.

03:29.550 --> 03:34.990
It also has some extra margin to the top so that there is some spacing between the lists.

03:35.310 --> 03:42.810
Well and if I now simply duplicate this list here and place it below the earliest and give this list

03:42.900 --> 03:50.640
a header of let's say sharing because could be are sharing options and I have to do with any one option

03:50.670 --> 03:58.410
and then Yunan option here if I save this again you see now we get this X drug group you could call

03:58.410 --> 04:00.910
it or extra list with its own header.

04:01.060 --> 04:08.130
Again having some spacing in between the list so that they really are easy to differentiate and with

04:08.130 --> 04:14.050
that we have numbered technique of creating kind of groups setting a theme setting a topic for this

04:14.060 --> 04:14.630
list.

04:14.730 --> 04:21.570
But having a more clearly separate that than the above list where we have our list dividers instead

04:22.230 --> 04:28.780
and that are different ways of styling or of using our lists of working with them.

04:28.920 --> 04:36.660
And of ever using normal lists as this one here the top one or two groups of items with dividers or

04:36.660 --> 04:37.980
lists with headers.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.870
Again have a look at the official docs if you want to dive even deeper into that.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.660
Falling to this lecture.

04:44.690 --> 04:50.990
I'll also have an article which explains how you can make a Dragonball list a list where you can reorder

04:51.000 --> 04:51.420
items.

04:51.420 --> 04:57.510
It's super easy to do and it's best shown by simply giving you an example again which you will find

04:57.780 --> 04:59.440
in the article after this video
