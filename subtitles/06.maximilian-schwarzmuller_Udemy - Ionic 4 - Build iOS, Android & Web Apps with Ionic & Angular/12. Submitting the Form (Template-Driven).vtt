WEBVTT

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.660
We registered our control.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.390
Now now it's I am unable to form to be submitted.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.370
I will use the normal approach you might know from a normal English to web app.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.310
I will first get a local reference to the form and you're treated for me and I can do this by placing

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.660
these local reference or naming it F on the form attribute to me on the form element.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.990
And like this it would only give me access to deform HVM element.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.780
I want to get access to the form English to created form in javascript and I tell Englad you that I

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.580
want to have access to this by assigning the entry form value to this local reference.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.070
That is the little trick we learn in normal English to course which gives us access to the form English

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.330
you created.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.000
Well and with this I can place the energy submit directive which only has this event year therefore

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.540
on it to listen to the submission of this form and then simply executes a method.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.530
Let's name it on an item for example and pass the form to this method.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.560
Well and with all this set up in place I can now go to the body of this typescript file to this combo

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.130
of this component remove all the boilerplate again which I don't need as of now and simply implement

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.550
the on add item method where I know that I will receive a form.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.780
So I will get a form as an argument because I'm passing it appear to be on an item method and this will

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.560
be of type Engy form of course.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.860
And with this form I'm getting here.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.130
Well I can simply log it to the console to see what we actually did get.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.870
So let me know save this and go back to your running application to UTIs an action.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.120
And now if I may enter.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.290
Well let's enter MoJ but 10 items of it.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.800
And click on an item you see here's the form God and there you see we got our controls which is a form

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.560
group and we also get a value for the overall ngi form element which has the amount and included name

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.310
properties.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.220
Since these are the two controls we registered.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.040
So with this we are submitting the form.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.490
Now let's also add some validation to it in the next lecture.
