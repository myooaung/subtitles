00:02.210 --> 00:07.890
And The Last Lecture we created the menu here but it's not really working because I don't have a way

00:07.890 --> 00:10.560
of replacing the root page.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.040
How can I replace page.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.450
You could think that I inject the NAF controller here.

00:16.470 --> 00:17.740
So let's do this.

00:17.910 --> 00:23.910
I simply add Neph controller you're injected like this.

00:23.910 --> 00:31.620
Make sure to imported from ionic angler and then an on load we can actually use the nav controller and

00:31.620 --> 00:38.130
it indeed has a method called set route which allows me to set the route page so which pretty much empties

00:38.220 --> 00:41.430
the stack of pages and replaces the root page.

00:41.460 --> 00:45.840
However there is one big issue I'm in the up component.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.980
This is where the application gets started.

00:49.070 --> 00:55.150
NF is the thing ironic to will recognize to initialize the stack of pages.

00:55.200 --> 01:03.480
However here in my constructor where I checked the nav controller in the app component This is at a

01:03.480 --> 01:07.470
point of time where the stack of pages won't have been created yet.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.020
Therefore we can't check nav controller here in AB component because it's not a whaleboat in the way

01:13.020 --> 01:18.570
we wanted to be available because the navigation stack hasn't been created yet.

01:19.050 --> 01:24.330
Thankfully there's a different way of getting access to our navigation stack.

01:24.330 --> 01:35.090
We can use at view child at the view child you need to import that from angular core it's angler to

01:35.160 --> 01:38.110
syntax not ironic to syntax.

01:38.360 --> 01:47.870
And here I want to get access to whip's to my I and Neph element which as I explained earlier is kind

01:47.870 --> 01:51.890
of my neph controller represented in a template.

01:51.980 --> 01:57.170
So this is what instantiates they have control of what creates my navigation stack.

01:57.170 --> 02:03.320
So I need to get access to this and it will have access via navigation Stec because view child well-selected

02:03.380 --> 02:08.690
offered template has been rendered and therefore after the stack has been initialized.

02:09.110 --> 02:20.220
Now to get access I could selected by type but I could also simply say or simply select it by this reference

02:20.220 --> 02:20.690
here.

02:20.850 --> 02:27.510
So Nav. would pass this as a string neth and this will now select the element which has this as a local

02:27.510 --> 02:31.150
reference in the template which of course is I-and Nath.

02:31.410 --> 02:34.240
And with this I'm getting access to it.

02:34.290 --> 02:39.760
I'm starting with a property in Neph and it will be of type nav controller like this.

02:39.870 --> 02:43.490
Make sure to again import Neph controller.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.460
But now we're not injecting it.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.770
We're getting access to it.

02:46.800 --> 02:52.140
Once it has been created so make sure to have this import here.

02:52.170 --> 02:55.520
Now we're having access to Nath now in on load.

02:55.530 --> 03:03.620
I can say this Nath cetra route and now I want to set the page I selected in the menu as to route page.

03:03.990 --> 03:09.710
I also want to do something else and for Disney to inject something I need to check the menu controller

03:09.720 --> 03:16.150
and I will store it in a property name menu controller menu controller is imported from ionic angular

03:16.620 --> 03:18.640
and make sure to add to import.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.640
It allows us to manage the menu.

03:20.790 --> 03:24.480
Now when we later open it obviously it's open.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.520
But when we then select a menu item it doesn't close the menu automatically.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.410
We have to do this and we do it Ruda menu controller there it can close or can call close and this will

03:35.430 --> 03:39.720
close to currently opened menu exactly what we need.

03:40.230 --> 03:45.270
That will create the menu that will allow us to replace the route page.

03:45.270 --> 03:51.120
The issue is we're not able to see this in action because we don't have the menu item here so let's

03:51.120 --> 03:53.470
add the menu item in the next lecture.
