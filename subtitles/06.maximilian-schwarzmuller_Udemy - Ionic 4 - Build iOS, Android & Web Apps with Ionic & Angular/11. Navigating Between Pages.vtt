00:02.220 --> 00:09.390
To go to the recipe detail page when we click a recipe item, we can use a feature you already know. You

00:09.390 --> 00:14.670
can go to the ion-item you're rendering in the recipes page which is the item you want to make clickable

00:15.060 --> 00:21.930
and you could add a click listener and navigate programmatically but you can also just use Router link

00:21.930 --> 00:29.610
here as you can do in a normal Angular app and that is really amazing. In Ionic 2 and 3, you had to use

00:29.630 --> 00:35.490
Ionic's own navigation solution for going to different parts of the app and it did use Angular for

00:35.490 --> 00:38.450
to components but added its own navigation.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.980
Now Ionic fully embraces Angular and it will do the same for React and Vue by the way

00:43.980 --> 00:49.410
and that means that you don't have to keep an eye on Ionic and update when that changes and keep an

00:49.410 --> 00:55.890
eye on Angular and maybe you're not able to update Angular because Ionic didn't update yet,

00:55.920 --> 01:03.210
instead you now only depend on Angular. You use native Angular features, like Angular routing as it is

01:03.210 --> 01:09.480
baked into Angular and Ionic only takes care about offering a nice page transition, a nice animation,

01:09.510 --> 01:14.350
things like that but it gets out of the way when it comes to the heavy lifting.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.890
So here, we can just enter a link

01:15.900 --> 01:22.080
we want to go to when this item is tapped and I want to go to a dynamic link of course because the ID

01:22.080 --> 01:28.800
I want to load differs. So I will bind this with square brackets to property binding and then, we pass

01:28.800 --> 01:36.050
an array of segments in here and we can add a relative link here, ./ and then recipe.id

01:36.390 --> 01:39.300
and this will now go to 

01:39.330 --> 01:40.220
/recipes, recipe.id.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.510
Now let's see if it works,

01:43.520 --> 01:51.920
if we save that, this page will reload and now if we tap this, we go to this page and you have a nice

01:52.280 --> 01:53.600
animation for this page

01:53.600 --> 01:55.550
transition out of the box.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.680
Now going back would also be nice

01:57.680 --> 01:57.890
right,

01:57.890 --> 01:58.910
where's the back button?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.760
Well the back button has to be added separately,

02:01.790 --> 02:06.260
so you can control whether you want to have a back button on a page or not.

02:06.260 --> 02:13.850
Now if we have a look at the Ionic docs and we go to components, then you will see that if you go all

02:13.850 --> 02:15.290
the way down to the toolbar,

02:19.910 --> 02:21.970
there is the ion-back-button.

02:22.940 --> 02:27.190
Now that back button here has to be included like this,

02:27.190 --> 02:32.650
you wrap it in an ions-buttons component actually which you would also use for other buttons in the

02:32.650 --> 02:40.060
toolbar, for different actions and you will give it a slot of start to position it on the default starting

02:40.060 --> 02:41.370
position of the platform,

02:41.380 --> 02:48.670
typically that is on the left but depending on the platform or on the region people are using your app

02:48.670 --> 02:53.120
in, it could also be on the right. So here,

02:53.370 --> 03:01.500
I will now add ion-buttons in the toolbar and give that a slot of start and in there, I'll add my

03:01.650 --> 03:05.180
ion-back-button. Now on that ion-back-button,

03:05.180 --> 03:14.120
you can also set a default ref attribute here for cases where this page here we are on, the recipe

03:14.120 --> 03:19.160
detail page, was loaded as a first page because since this is a web app, we can of course reload this

03:19.160 --> 03:21.120
page and boom, here we are

03:21.260 --> 03:28.550
and then we have no previous page in Ionic's history so to say. It keeps track of our navigation moves

03:28.550 --> 03:35.490
but if we reload the app, it reloads that stored stack of pages it thinks in and therefore, we can give

03:35.490 --> 03:40.880
this a default back link where we say OK, if you loaded this app and you don't know where we've

03:40.880 --> 03:44.390
been previously because maybe we haven't been anywhere previously,

03:44.390 --> 03:48.590
then I want to go to /recipes here let's say.

03:48.650 --> 03:56.120
So if we save all of that, as this app reloads here, we have the back button and we do go back.

03:56.170 --> 03:59.440
Now if I reload on this page here, let's try it the other way round,

03:59.440 --> 04:02.720
now if I go here, we got the back buttons as well.

04:02.980 --> 04:07.960
Now you will notice, at least right now if I tap anywhere else, we don't navigate again.

04:08.070 --> 04:13.630
And right now this is a known bug, maybe already fixed when you're viewing this, it is related to a relative

04:13.630 --> 04:15.100
path being used here and

04:15.130 --> 04:18.210
you can simply fix it by using an absolute path here.

04:18.210 --> 04:20.440
And for now, this is the easiest work around,

04:20.480 --> 04:22.960
use an absolute path for navigation

04:23.080 --> 04:31.930
and with that being used, you can go back, forth and back as often as you want to the different pages.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.990
So this is how we can navigate around

04:34.030 --> 04:41.020
and again most important takeaway, you use Angular features and Ionic just adds animations and Ionic

04:41.020 --> 04:43.790
also keeps track of your navigation moves,

04:43.900 --> 04:51.310
it constructs a stack of pages under the hood so to say so that it knows that you now have a previous

04:51.310 --> 04:57.280
page you haven't gone back to and you can go back by clicking the back button because if you didn't

04:57.280 --> 05:02.190
reload the page here, then this back button will even work without the default ref,

05:02.290 --> 05:03.880
if I temporarily remove that,

05:06.420 --> 05:12.060
you see as this page reloads now, it will not work and not display because it doesn't know where we've previously

05:12.060 --> 05:12.870
been.

05:12.870 --> 05:20.460
If I started on recipes, now I do have the button because now Ionic keeps track of that for us.

05:20.460 --> 05:26.540
But more on that in the routing and navigation module where we will dive deeply into how navigation

05:26.550 --> 05:27.270
works,

05:27.270 --> 05:29.640
also how we can integrate tabs and so on.
