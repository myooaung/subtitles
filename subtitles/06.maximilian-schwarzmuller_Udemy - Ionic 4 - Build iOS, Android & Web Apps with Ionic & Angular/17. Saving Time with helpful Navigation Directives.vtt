00:02.510 --> 00:09.980
So after our first assignment and exercise I'm back in the project from before with our users here where

00:09.980 --> 00:12.890
we can click and go to the individual users.

00:12.920 --> 00:19.250
We learned a lot about the basics of navigating around and we will learn even more in the various apps

00:19.250 --> 00:20.140
we're going to build.

00:20.150 --> 00:27.410
I don't want to convert that all in these basics module which is only there to introduce the well basics

00:27.490 --> 00:28.870
of Phiona to to you.

00:28.970 --> 00:32.680
Well we'll dive much deeper into it in the individual apps.

00:32.690 --> 00:37.860
Now what I want to show you right now is a nice shortcut for pushing and popping though.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.250
We push for example on our home page.

00:42.380 --> 00:46.920
We go to the user's page and we don't pass any data here.

00:46.970 --> 00:48.610
It takes a lot of code to push.

00:48.620 --> 00:54.290
We need to inject enough control or we need to have this method which we call here.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.490
There is a shorter way of doing this.

00:56.630 --> 01:00.570
We can actually get rid of the constructor enty on go to use this method.

01:00.590 --> 01:06.620
We can also get rid of the NAF control import therefore And then we can simply store the user's page

01:06.760 --> 01:09.270
class here or type in a property.

01:09.410 --> 01:11.520
Let's name it user page.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.900
The name is totally up to you.

01:13.100 --> 01:20.600
And this should simply store user page so I referenced to does class which we import here in the template.

01:20.840 --> 01:26.600
We can then instead of calling click listener here or setting up a click listener use a built in directive

01:26.690 --> 01:32.780
directive ironic to ships with we use it with proper keybinding because we need to pass some data to

01:32.780 --> 01:33.650
that directive.

01:33.800 --> 01:40.280
And the directive is called Neph push and close it in square brackets for property binding and the data

01:40.280 --> 01:47.780
I need to push is a property which stores the page I want to push to so user page is the name we set

01:47.780 --> 01:52.410
up here the property was set up here which holds a reference to the page you want to push to.

01:52.700 --> 01:59.450
Well if this is if I saved this I on a server is still running you will see that we're still taking

01:59.450 --> 02:05.640
to the users page but we saved some code noticed a convenient way if you don't need to pass any data.

02:05.780 --> 02:12.980
And a similar method exists for going back if you want to go back let's say on the user's page you not

02:12.980 --> 02:20.660
only have your users buttons but you also add a new button type iron button and all you want to do is

02:20.900 --> 02:21.980
you want to go back.

02:22.070 --> 02:27.370
Yes you have to go back button at the top in the navigation bar but let's say you have another button

02:27.620 --> 02:32.330
you could add a click listener call math and then the Mefford you could use the control or to pop the

02:32.330 --> 02:37.170
page or you simply add the nav pop directive to the button.

02:37.220 --> 02:41.090
Now without square brackets because we don't need to pass any data to that directive.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.820
So we're not using property binding with this if we saved this.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.730
You will see that a new button will appear on the user's page.

02:47.870 --> 02:50.610
And this button simply well takes us back.

02:50.780 --> 02:51.550
Awesome right.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.800
So these are two convenient helper directives you can use for pushing and popping if you have a very

02:58.040 --> 03:04.650
default standard non exciting pushing or popping process where you don't need to set any special options.
