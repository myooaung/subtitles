00:02.260 --> 00:04.960
Well for a start let's simply see if it's there.

00:05.410 --> 00:13.240
So here where a check of the form is valid since I have no validator on my image here I will add an

00:13.240 --> 00:15.750
extra check here in on create offer inst.

00:15.760 --> 00:22.540
Basically not continue if the form is invalid or if this form.

00:22.540 --> 00:26.620
Get image value so the value of that image control.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.210
We just edit is not set.

00:28.210 --> 00:30.990
So if that is still knowledge no image was added somehow.

00:31.030 --> 00:37.580
Then I also want to return here because then we don't have a valid form that also means that in the

00:37.580 --> 00:46.740
template of my new offer page where I enable that submit button when the form is valid I want to enable

00:46.740 --> 00:52.410
this when the forum is where I want the disabled is when the form is not valid and I want to all to

00:52.410 --> 00:53.370
disable it.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.980
If the form

00:58.600 --> 01:01.460
image value is not set.

01:01.570 --> 01:03.660
So this is an extra check.

01:03.670 --> 01:05.920
I want to add there at my template as well.

01:06.070 --> 01:12.610
With that let's go back to the new offer page typescript code and there what I want to do eventually

01:13.060 --> 01:18.030
is I want to upload that image to a back and so that we can store it there.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.580
But this will be a second step.

01:20.800 --> 01:28.420
For the moment let's simply console lock this form value year to see if all these values are added and

01:28.420 --> 01:30.730
if the image is stored there correctly as well.

01:31.060 --> 01:38.020
And one minor thing which are all to want to do is on the file picture here.

01:38.020 --> 01:45.260
I'll also add the accept attribute and only accept shaping image has to be in line with the camera plugin

01:45.280 --> 01:47.710
which also gives us only Che pack images.

01:47.710 --> 01:53.980
We do this by adding except image slash Che pack with that.

01:54.110 --> 01:59.690
Let's wait for that to reload.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.990
Here it is.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.750
Let's click take picture.

02:02.750 --> 02:08.930
I can select that here and now let's also fill out the other parts of this form.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.070
So pick a place here.

02:10.070 --> 02:16.860
Enter a description something like Dad pick a starting and ending date here.

02:18.170 --> 02:22.280
And now it's become submit a bill and if I submitted it gets created.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.380
Here is our place and you can see the image was set too and it was set to that file here.

02:27.390 --> 02:36.110
Let's all to try this on a mobile device now so I'll run ionic capacitor run Android to see it on my

02:36.110 --> 02:41.530
android device and see if there we still use the camera because we certainly should not use the file

02:41.530 --> 02:42.310
picture there.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.270
So here I am on Android.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.880
Now let's fill this out.

02:47.930 --> 02:52.650
Munich really great city.

02:54.260 --> 02:59.040
Quite expensive unfortunately pick a date

03:01.860 --> 03:08.800
whips like that that select the location and lets auto locate here and let's take a picture.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.020
Take picture and that does looks good.

03:12.020 --> 03:17.040
We're not using the file picture now of course does not Munich but our dummy preview or dummy image

03:17.040 --> 03:20.660
we get and that looks good.

03:20.660 --> 03:26.650
And now if I submit this we create that place of course right now without uploading the image we haven't

03:26.650 --> 03:28.030
added that functionality yet.
