00:01.880 --> 00:08.360
Time to get our added page or edit recipe page to be able to well edit recipes and not just to create

00:08.360 --> 00:16.380
ones to teach it this new trick I will go to the EDID recipe typescript file and we have to start in

00:16.390 --> 00:18.410
the entry on a method.

00:18.410 --> 00:24.460
This is where we initialize the form and we have to initialize it differently depending on whether we're

00:24.460 --> 00:27.500
in an edit mode or in new mode.

00:27.590 --> 00:31.170
Well we're actually initializing and initialize for a method to your.

00:31.430 --> 00:38.700
But we're extracting the mode here and now we need to check if the mode actually is added.

00:38.930 --> 00:46.920
Remember I'm passing edit here as the mode in the recipe that this file if the mode is added.

00:47.050 --> 00:51.240
But then we should also extract and store the recipe in the index right.

00:51.270 --> 00:55.790
So let's add a recipe property year which is of type recipe of course.

00:55.980 --> 00:58.200
Make sure to add does import.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.940
It's an undefined at the beginning.

01:01.170 --> 01:04.460
And I also want to store the index of that recipe which has a number.

01:04.680 --> 01:10.710
You could of course also store this all in one property which stores an object whatever you prefer.

01:10.710 --> 01:18.210
Now in this if block here I will set the recipe equal to well the recipe extract from their parents

01:18.450 --> 01:22.440
and I know that it will be present in their parents because the moders edit.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.180
This is why I have to check.

01:24.410 --> 01:27.050
And here I simply get my recipe.

01:27.180 --> 01:33.930
This will then retrieve this property which I pass here in the object or which you find your object

01:33.930 --> 01:38.910
we pass with the push Meffert and then I also want to retrieve the index.

01:38.910 --> 01:41.680
So let's do this in the next line here.

01:41.700 --> 01:47.910
I will quickly fetch the index via Neph parents of that and retrieving that extra information which

01:47.910 --> 01:53.160
we can now use in initialize for and to change the way we initialize the form.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.560
So let's scale down there.

01:56.260 --> 01:59.700
Here in initialize form what does change.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.560
If we're in edit mode.

02:01.910 --> 02:05.480
Well the thing which changes are default values now.

02:05.510 --> 02:07.160
Now medium and empty array.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.570
That's not true with reediting a recipe.

02:09.740 --> 02:13.380
Instead we should then get the actual values.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.540
So I will define some variables here.

02:16.580 --> 02:22.020
Title for example which is null initially or a description which is null.

02:22.070 --> 02:30.460
So these are the default values for the new mode then difficulty which will be medium so all the default

02:30.460 --> 02:38.460
values I'm using right now but now stored in variables also ingredients will simply be an empty array.

02:38.470 --> 02:46.130
Now if that I can simply use those variables and use them down there to initialize my default values.

02:46.150 --> 02:51.940
Now if that of course right now we haven't changed anything except for that we now have more lines of

02:51.940 --> 02:59.300
code but we gained extra flexibility between the definition of those variables and the usage year.

02:59.350 --> 03:04.050
I can change them and I want to change them but the mode is added.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.810
If I'm in added mode right.

03:06.070 --> 03:09.830
In this case I want to override the default values.

03:10.030 --> 03:16.960
In this case I want to say title is of course the title of the recipe extracted recipe title.

03:17.020 --> 03:24.060
Remember this recipe is the property I'm extracting and engine in it here from their parents.

03:24.490 --> 03:32.190
So does the actual select recipe and that will do the same for all those settings for all those items.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.940
This recipe description is of course assigned to destruction.

03:36.100 --> 03:39.490
The difficulty is also retrieved this recipe.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.500
The difficulty and the ingredients.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.920
Well the ingredients can also be retrieved.

03:44.940 --> 03:52.540
However there I don't say this recipe ingredients because remember ingredients is an array of ingredients.

03:52.540 --> 03:56.110
Following this model with a name and an amount.

03:56.110 --> 04:04.150
However here an EDID recipe I need this for a form Airey and desirÃ© I need form controls not my ingredient

04:04.150 --> 04:04.910
items.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.350
Therefore this is wrong and will not work.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.770
I don't need my model here.

04:08.800 --> 04:15.710
I need an array of form controls so instead I will create a for loop where I loop through all the ingredients.

04:15.820 --> 04:22.860
Extracting the individual one and storing it in this variable of this recipe ingredients all through

04:22.870 --> 04:29.260
all my ingredients in this recipe and for each ingredient I will push it to this empty array.

04:29.260 --> 04:37.030
I set up here so this ingredients array up here is now being used hearable push a new form control because

04:37.030 --> 04:43.390
again this is what form array expects a form control and this control is initialized with a default

04:43.390 --> 04:50.050
value which is ingredient name and it will also receive the required validator of course because it

04:50.050 --> 04:52.920
must not be empty like this.

04:52.930 --> 04:58.390
So with this I am initializing those values or I'm overwriting those values in added mode.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.590
Fetching the actual values.

05:01.180 --> 05:05.670
And with this new recipe form should now be initialized correctly.

05:06.220 --> 05:12.700
Well let's see this in action by saving this letting it recompile and then creating a new recipe and

05:12.700 --> 05:17.870
then editing it or go to the recipes tab loaded here.

05:17.920 --> 05:24.100
Create my Schnitzler again which you know it is tasty and easy let's say I want to change a lot here

05:24.100 --> 05:29.270
so that we can see it gets loaded correctly at the French fries.

05:29.300 --> 05:37.230
And let's also add another item you're the meat and where there is a new recipe.

05:37.330 --> 05:42.830
And now if I clicked on it and click Edit it loads it here and this looks pretty good to me.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.480
These are the values I entered before.

05:45.800 --> 05:51.700
If I remove the here the button gets disabled because it's now no longer valid.

05:51.740 --> 05:56.960
However of course if I click here I'm not editing it I'm creating a new one because we haven't changed

05:56.970 --> 05:58.510
the onset method yet.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.800
Let's do this as a next step.
