00:01.830 --> 00:04.900
After having a look at Buttons lists list items in the grid.

00:04.930 --> 00:08.240
I know when I have a close look at gestures we can use.

00:08.370 --> 00:14.800
So far we often use the normal click event which of course is also fired if we touch element.

00:14.880 --> 00:22.080
Let's see which average listeners we have and when we might want to use which for this I'm going to

00:22.080 --> 00:28.650
add some content to the top of this home component here again so that we can see how to use that.

00:28.830 --> 00:36.840
And I will yet add a new day of year which I'll give a class of gestures which I'll quickly give some

00:36.840 --> 00:44.280
styling and years of them we can see the death and I simply want to give it a width of 100 percent a

00:44.280 --> 00:47.330
height of let's say 30 pixels.

00:47.670 --> 00:56.890
And the background color of light green light gray green like this.

00:56.890 --> 01:04.530
So if we do this I placed one day of in there you should see the DiStefano appears here at the top.

01:04.540 --> 01:14.290
Now on this death I'll say click me and I'll add a normal click listener as we did many times before.

01:14.300 --> 01:18.580
Unbuttons And of course we can add it to any element like the staff here.

01:18.620 --> 01:26.110
So here I will say on element clicked and of course again this all means it fires if we touch it on

01:26.110 --> 01:27.240
a mobile device.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.510
This is the same event.

01:28.600 --> 01:33.240
So on element clicked and here we can then say console log.

01:33.550 --> 01:42.150
I was liked or touched to make sure too that it's really clear that this is the same on a mobile device.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.840
So if we do this and we go back to our application and it click on it you see what clicked or touched

01:46.900 --> 01:47.640
on the right.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.670
So this clearly works no matter where we touch it.

01:50.710 --> 01:57.410
Now you are probably aware that there are more gestures we can do on a mobile device we can long press

01:57.410 --> 01:59.400
an element who can swipe it.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.700
We can pan.

02:00.700 --> 02:06.730
So there are different features or different gestures we can execute.

02:06.730 --> 02:13.390
Let's look into them here and actually can find an article in the component documentation to learn more

02:13.390 --> 02:14.760
about it for example here.

02:14.890 --> 02:21.040
Here you see all available gestures you can listen to by simply adding the appropriate event listeners

02:21.040 --> 02:22.240
to any element.

02:22.240 --> 02:26.260
For example tap breastpin swipe rotate and pinch.

02:26.260 --> 02:32.770
Now I won't be able to demonstrate them all here with a mouse because for some of them you need more

02:32.770 --> 02:40.180
fingers for example pinch but the ones I can demonstrate here I will demonstrate the other ones are

02:40.180 --> 02:47.070
of course things you can try out after the next section when you learned how to run this on a real device.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.070
Let's start with the tap event.

02:50.320 --> 03:01.770
I'm going to add a new Dith simply duplicate the first one like this and here I will not listen to a

03:01.770 --> 03:08.280
click but to a tap and that will add a new listener on elements tapped like this.

03:08.550 --> 03:16.320
And also add the appropriate method here of course in the typewriter class so that I can say I was tapped.

03:16.350 --> 03:23.880
Now if I say this and I let the application rebuild we should be able to see a new death year and if

03:23.880 --> 03:27.640
I click on it I get I was tapped.

03:27.660 --> 03:31.350
So what's different between tapping and clicking then.

03:31.410 --> 03:34.360
Because it obviously does the same here.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.650
I'll come back to this in a second.

03:36.660 --> 03:43.740
Let's have a look at the number gesture first on a change just to tap me instead of click mesons just

03:43.760 --> 03:45.130
seems more appropriate.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.230
As for listening to a tap event.

03:47.590 --> 03:55.050
So I'm going to add a new div and on this I'm going to say Long press me does the name of to get gesture

03:55.080 --> 04:02.930
kind of and I'm going to listen to the press event I'm also executing a method here on element press.

04:02.940 --> 04:06.070
Let's say let's also add this math therefore.

04:06.360 --> 04:11.850
And if I add this year I can now execute the code and print something to the console.

04:11.880 --> 04:16.320
I was pressed so let's do this now.

04:16.620 --> 04:24.880
If I save this and I go back to the application I can now click on it and you don't see anything in

04:24.880 --> 04:30.780
a console but if I click and hold us for a couple of seconds you'll see Iowas pressed on the right.

04:30.920 --> 04:37.920
So now this list is for the duration of our press and not just for if we tapped or clicked on there.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.280
This now also allows me to show you the difference between tap and click.

04:42.710 --> 04:49.250
I'm going to the same of the one where I say long press me and I'm going to at the click Lisner here

04:49.340 --> 04:51.800
where I execute on element clicked.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.030
So now I have two listeners on the same event which of course is perfectly fine.

04:56.120 --> 05:02.870
And now let's see what happens if I now go to this div which says Long press me and I long press on

05:02.870 --> 05:03.250
it.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.410
You see I was pressed but you'll see I was clicked or touched.

05:06.530 --> 05:08.770
So both fired even though.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.240
Well we are pressing it.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.870
We're not tapping it.

05:13.040 --> 05:20.300
And this is the key difference between click and tap click will always be fired when you touch an element

05:20.390 --> 05:24.620
no matter how long you do that which might be the behavior you want.

05:24.920 --> 05:31.700
But if you want to differentiate between a long and a short touch even and you have to use tap and press

05:31.790 --> 05:35.810
and not click and press because click will always be executed.

05:35.900 --> 05:40.840
Now you will see that only one of the two will execute since I had a tap instead of click.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.510
So now I have press and tap.

05:42.770 --> 05:47.990
And now if I press shortly on it you see I was tapped and overhaul for a couple of milliseconds.

05:47.990 --> 05:49.250
You see I was pressed.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.680
So either of the two fires not both.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.950
So again this is the difference between clicking and tapping.

05:54.950 --> 05:59.960
And this might be important for your app if it doesn't matter if you don't need that differentiation

06:00.320 --> 06:02.810
always using clicking as we did before.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.030
Is of course absolutely fine.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.110
Nothing wrong with that.

06:07.130 --> 06:12.080
Now as you can see in documentation there are more events you can listen to for example swiping rotating

06:12.080 --> 06:13.290
pinching and panning.

06:13.370 --> 06:18.490
And again you will need to test some of them on a mobile device because you need more than one thing

06:18.490 --> 06:20.920
or for pinching for example.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.310
These are different gestures.

06:22.310 --> 06:28.710
I want to make swayable to you which should allow you to fine tune the app to your needs.
