00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.770
So with the recipe detail page working as it should.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.010
We can now start working on it and make this added recipe button word so that we're actually able to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.310
edit the recipe and load the recipe in edit mode to do so.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.030
I will first of all need to hook up this edit recipe button.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.120
I'm executing on edit recipe when clicking this button.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.720
So time to implement this method.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.610
Now in the rest of PTSA file in the body of this component here and this is actually a super simple

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.330
method.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.230
All I want to do here is I want to execute indef. or used the nav controller to then execute the push

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.000
method.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:49.850
And on this push method I want to push my edit recipe page you need to import this page at the top there

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.630
for and Judah's page.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490
I now need to pass some extra data.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.360
First of all the mode which is set to edit remember'd a mode.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.120
We also set it on our recipes page for this plus button in the nav bar there we passed most new.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.210
Now I am passing mode at it and it will pass some extra information for this case the recipe which is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.380
stored in the recipe property and the index which is stored in the index property year this index of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.900
course use a colon here.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.180
So with that I'm passing the data we need to have to the added recipe page.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.550
Now the next step of course is to edit this page so that we're able to handle both cases.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.150
Creation of a new recipe which you can already do and editing of a recipe what we can do.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.140
Let's start working on this next lecture
