00:02.250 --> 00:05.500
I will continue with the app we built in the last course module,

00:05.500 --> 00:09.660
this very simple recipe app built with the help of Angular.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.660
Now as always, the official docs are your friend,

00:13.660 --> 00:19.810
if you get stuck, if something is unclear, you find step-by-step instructions here under guide and then

00:19.840 --> 00:26.560
under running on iOS or running on Android. There you'll learn all the steps you need to execute to

00:26.560 --> 00:28.050
turn your web app into,

00:28.060 --> 00:34.210
in this case here, an Android app and here for iOS. Now important,

00:34.210 --> 00:40.680
you need to have certain tools installed to succeed here and also important,

00:40.720 --> 00:49.480
if you building locally on your machine, then you actually need to be on a MacOS system to build for

00:49.480 --> 00:58.260
iOS. You can't build iOS apps on Windows unless you're using Ionic's paid service, AppFlow,

00:58.420 --> 01:03.270
that is something you can do and you can learn more about that on ionicframework.com,

01:03.340 --> 01:08.590
there you can build your app in the cloud instead of on your machine and then on the cloud,

01:08.680 --> 01:12.070
it can be built on a MacOS environment but this is a paid service,

01:12.070 --> 01:13.430
I'll not be covering it here.

01:13.480 --> 01:19.390
So if you build it locally as we do then, you could only build for iOS, on MacOS systems. Android

01:19.390 --> 01:23.860
apps can be built on both MacOS and Windows systems as well as Linux.

01:23.890 --> 01:26.230
So what are the requirements then?
