00:02.540 --> 00:03.890
To show that map model.

00:03.920 --> 00:07.270
Well we already made our first step.

00:07.310 --> 00:12.780
We can now call then and get our modal element here which we can of course present.

00:12.860 --> 00:20.210
So modal l present like this and this will open our map modal component in a new modal.

00:20.660 --> 00:22.810
With that let's go to the map modal component.

00:22.870 --> 00:27.680
Let's make sure we get something onto the screen there in the map modal component.

00:27.740 --> 00:33.500
I will add I and header I didn't add that to the location picker because that will be a component I

00:33.500 --> 00:40.010
use inside of Abra components the map modal component on the other hand should render it like a single

00:40.010 --> 00:47.480
page even though it's enclosed in a modal I want to have a toolbar in there and I'll add a title and

00:47.480 --> 00:55.950
there I will say pick location and I'll add some buttons here with iron buttons like this and you see

00:55.950 --> 00:58.050
I'm getting a bunch of errors here.

00:58.050 --> 01:05.070
The reason is that in the shared module where I declared the map more modal I'm not importing the ionic

01:05.070 --> 01:08.610
module which actually unlocks all these ionic components.

01:08.610 --> 01:15.810
So make sure to add the ionic module import from at ionic angular 2D shared mode module.

01:15.810 --> 01:22.110
And with that added you'll see that all these errors will magically go away since that unlocks all these

01:22.290 --> 01:24.050
ionic components.

01:24.060 --> 01:30.060
So now back to the buttons in the toolbar I'll add I add buttons with a slot of primary to add them

01:30.060 --> 01:38.010
on the right side typically and then I'll add a button here which will actually say cancel so that when

01:38.010 --> 01:44.070
we open that modal to pick a location we can tap on the map to pick a location or we click the cancel

01:44.070 --> 01:45.380
button to get out of there.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.610
And of course for that I'll add a click listener here and call on cancel.

01:49.710 --> 01:55.680
Now after that I'll add my iron content here and inside of the iron content I'll add a simple death

01:55.980 --> 01:58.940
which I will actually use to render my map.

01:59.070 --> 02:06.240
And for that I'll give that a class of map and also a local reference of map by which I can later selected

02:06.240 --> 02:10.560
in my typescript code to interact with that div and render the map there.

02:10.680 --> 02:16.530
So let me go back to the map modal component then and first of all I'll add the on cancel handler here

02:16.560 --> 02:23.400
which is triggered when we click the cancel button in our toolbar and there I want to close the model

02:23.490 --> 02:29.540
now too close that I need to inject the modal controller here as well.

02:29.670 --> 02:30.950
So let's do just that.

02:30.960 --> 02:37.050
Let's add the modal controller imported from ionic angular to the map modal component and an on cancel

02:37.060 --> 02:41.700
we can then use this to call this Miss and this mist is modal here.

02:41.700 --> 02:46.970
With that we got everything to open a modal and dismiss it but we're not displaying a map.

02:46.980 --> 02:48.840
Let's preview does nonetheless.

02:48.840 --> 02:54.960
And to review this we just need to make sure we include the location picker component here with the

02:55.230 --> 02:58.720
application picker selector in our form.

02:58.730 --> 03:02.550
So in the new offer page here and for that.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.870
And then you offer a module I will import that shared module.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.220
That's the idea of having that shared module.

03:08.280 --> 03:14.460
So now I can use the picker and also the modal if I want you in this component and make sure you have

03:14.460 --> 03:22.570
the right path here which should be a relative path now and then you offer page here I'll add a new

03:22.750 --> 03:30.070
row and then you call him of course and the dead column will receive the same size classes as my other

03:30.070 --> 03:32.800
columns to be in line with them.

03:33.330 --> 03:39.970
So let me add that there and then inside of this I in column we can add the app location picker just

03:39.970 --> 03:45.260
like that with that we should be able to see that button.

03:45.390 --> 03:52.470
Let's go back to our application here and let's create a new offer and here's our then if I tap it indeed

03:52.590 --> 03:57.030
that mode opens but of course there is no map in there so time to finally render dead.
