00:02.300 --> 00:08.350
Now that we had a closer look at some of the important components elements and features they only two

00:08.350 --> 00:09.260
ships with.

00:09.570 --> 00:15.780
There's one thing I really want to highlight with all those built in components it can be easily overlooked

00:15.980 --> 00:18.800
that we're still building an angle or two application here.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.860
And that of course means we can also add our own components.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.340
So let's do this now.

00:23.480 --> 00:29.540
For this I'm going to create a new folder in the source folder and all named components since I shouldn't

00:29.540 --> 00:33.670
put my own components in the pages folder since we won't create a new page.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.290
We only want to create a component which takes up the a part of a page and it's not used as a full page

00:39.290 --> 00:40.880
in our navigation stack.

00:41.270 --> 00:48.120
And then there I will create my touch event component name a touch event or component or TS.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.970
Though you could argue to not use dot components since it's placed in the components folder anyways.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.020
Kind of the same logic.

00:54.030 --> 01:01.490
As for the pages so choose whichever naming style you prefer in here all export the class which of course

01:01.490 --> 01:08.510
name touch event component and this will be a normal angler to compile it just like a page.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.530
But I will use it differently.

01:10.580 --> 01:13.880
So here let's add the component decorator.

01:13.880 --> 01:22.600
Of course the component decorator then needs to be imported from an angular core so from at a new core

01:22.610 --> 01:24.160
like this.

01:24.390 --> 01:31.530
And then we should add a template and a selector So the selector could be anything you like and I will

01:31.530 --> 01:42.110
simply give it as a selector of AB touch event to make sure that I add as unique prefix here and then

01:42.110 --> 01:43.400
a template.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.520
Now the template could be an X from template or inline template.

01:46.520 --> 01:53.830
I'll use an external to him inline template here excuse me and I will simply copy all my gesture code

01:53.830 --> 01:54.300
here.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.700
The free this year.

01:55.880 --> 02:03.980
I will cut it and copy it into my touch U-bend component template just like this and change to styling.

02:03.980 --> 02:08.090
So now I have them inside of that extra component.

02:08.090 --> 02:16.410
I will therefore also to remove the methods from my home Dotty's file and place it into this newly created

02:16.410 --> 02:20.430
component so that this component now in itself works again.

02:20.430 --> 02:26.820
Now of course I need to register it here in the declarations aere the touch event component and also

02:26.820 --> 02:30.080
make sure to add the import here pointing to the full path.

02:30.330 --> 02:36.450
But I don't need to add a to entry components because I won't load this component through Iyonix to

02:36.450 --> 02:39.150
use navigation stack of pages.

02:39.270 --> 02:45.540
Instead I will use it and load it in a very traditional way by placing it in the template of my home

02:45.540 --> 02:46.990
page here.

02:47.160 --> 02:54.210
App touch event was a touchy Vence no touchy and that's this electorate shows the touchy one component

02:54.660 --> 02:58.480
and I'm including it here as we do in a normal angle or two.

02:58.530 --> 03:01.110
Because again this is what we're building here.

03:01.110 --> 03:06.710
All those I add elements are just ionic to components and therefore they are English are two components

03:06.720 --> 03:07.260
in the end.

03:07.410 --> 03:13.450
So I'm using a normal component in a normal English to application important.

03:13.530 --> 03:18.170
I added the two declarations since I use it by selector here.

03:18.180 --> 03:24.120
I don't need to add a two entry components because you will be able to figure out that we're using this

03:24.120 --> 03:25.290
component on its own.

03:25.290 --> 03:31.740
Since we're using a selector and with that if I go back to the application it looks and works the same

03:31.740 --> 03:37.830
as before but now with my own component in place and I just found this super important to highlight.

03:37.950 --> 03:41.520
You can and you should still use your own components.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.570
Not every component has to be a page.

03:44.850 --> 03:51.930
If you only want to replace part of your screen off your page components with your own component that's

03:51.930 --> 03:53.200
perfectly fine.

03:53.310 --> 04:00.420
And actually for more complex pages or parts which you reuse across multiple pages or components you

04:00.420 --> 04:04.940
should definitely do that as you would do it in any angle or to application
