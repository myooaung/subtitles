In this lecture I want to show you how you could override your backpack and text.

00:05.590 --> 00:09.490
De-evolved it always says back but sometimes you don't want to say back.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.910
Therefore I will tell you how you can change it and I will actually show you two different approaches

00:13.910 --> 00:15.230
of doing so.

00:15.230 --> 00:21.440
Now for this to work we need a back button so let's generate a new page on name and users.

00:22.310 --> 00:27.650
And this will of course at this entry we need to add this to app modules so that's at the user's page

00:27.650 --> 00:28.290
here.

00:28.580 --> 00:36.310
And of course all add the import and at the user's page two entry components and then in my home aged

00:36.330 --> 00:45.380
e-mail file I will simply add a button here with iron button on it with D-Nev. push directive on it

00:45.640 --> 00:52.380
where I want to push to the user's page and here I will simply say to users on the button as a caption.

00:52.430 --> 00:57.950
Now the users page property here is unknown so that's added to the typescript file and that should of

00:57.950 --> 01:00.020
course hold a reference to the user's page.

01:00.020 --> 01:06.980
Make sure to import user's page from the user's file here in the Users folder to where we can go to

01:06.980 --> 01:08.050
the user's page.

01:08.060 --> 01:08.420
That's good.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.810
You see this I already have I on Axert running here.

01:11.810 --> 01:18.690
So let's quickly see our running application and then if I click on two users we see we were on the

01:18.690 --> 01:20.990
users page and we get this back button.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.160
Now I want to change this text to home let's say.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.420
Now there are two approaches of doing so.

01:26.460 --> 01:29.800
Let me show you the first one in the USALS page.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.610
This is where we can change it.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.600
Let's look at the template now.

01:33.630 --> 01:36.860
The back button is an added to our eye nav bar.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.940
So the first approach is all about getting access to this nav bar.

01:41.940 --> 01:45.000
I can simply do this by the users tiers file.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.640
I'll just clean this comment and all that stuff don't need this in this file.

01:49.710 --> 01:55.350
By simply getting an Access Tudor's and nav bar component.

01:55.350 --> 02:02.520
Now this is the Natcore component I on a two ships with and I can use at view child days angular to

02:03.090 --> 02:09.480
methhead or decorator which has to be imported from an angler core which allows me to select elements

02:09.570 --> 02:10.980
in my template.

02:11.010 --> 02:19.110
Now I could place a reference on INFP or like this nav hash tag Nath and then simply passing nav as

02:19.110 --> 02:21.040
a string year like this.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.880
But since I N.F. bar is simply the nav bar component I want to do ships with.

02:26.880 --> 02:34.620
I can also pass nav bar here as a type to be imported from my onic angular here as an argument to view

02:34.620 --> 02:40.200
child and store this in a nav bar property this name of course is up to you and I know that it will

02:40.200 --> 02:41.450
be of type nav bar.

02:41.460 --> 02:49.170
Obviously this will give me access to the neth bar and then I can now go to I in view will enter let's

02:49.170 --> 02:56.070
say when Edwards is about to become active to access my nav bar and here I have the set back button

02:56.100 --> 03:02.760
text method and I can simply pass the text year as a string let's say home.

03:02.850 --> 03:08.430
Now by doing this I can now save this and let's have a look at this application here once it reloads

03:10.030 --> 03:14.360
if we now go to the users page you now see home as the text year.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.870
So that is a super easy way of overwriting it.

03:17.130 --> 03:22.360
As a side note you can also disable the back button like this on the nav bar.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.080
You can also have a look at height back button here.

03:26.850 --> 03:29.850
And set this to true now you won't see any bag.

03:29.850 --> 03:31.910
But let me quickly demonstrate this too.

03:32.070 --> 03:37.740
So by saving this the application will rebuild and reload and once we get there no back button that

03:37.760 --> 03:38.710
we're stuck.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.940
So this is the easy way of controlling the back button but it's not the only way.

03:43.230 --> 03:49.660
The other way is to use the constructor to inject something and that something is the view controller.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.830
We learned about this throughout the course didn't we.

03:52.110 --> 03:58.710
So here this will be of type view controller of course and the controller needs to be imported from

03:58.800 --> 03:59.960
ionic angler's.

03:59.970 --> 04:03.970
Let's quickly do this controller like this.

04:04.470 --> 04:07.250
And what's that important on that view controller.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.320
We can execute set back button.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.280
Text 2.

04:10.440 --> 04:16.150
So this gives us an easy access to DNA bar basically does the same as when getting access to the the

04:16.300 --> 04:17.700
bar ourselves.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.820
Here we use the Wii controller which does that for you.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.960
So that might be easier or a quicker way.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.510
And here you also can hide the back button though.

04:26.550 --> 04:31.530
Here it shows back button where you pass false for example.

04:31.540 --> 04:36.660
So I'm a little bit different but again too easy and quick methods of controlling the back button.

04:36.660 --> 04:41.610
Now I'm going to comment this out so that we can see that the renaming works by saving theirs and letting

04:41.610 --> 04:46.380
the app reload if we now click onto users.

04:46.380 --> 04:51.760
Here is the back button with their home label again or the caption of home.

04:51.780 --> 04:57.480
So these are quick and easy ways of changing the appearance of your back button something you might

04:57.480 --> 04:59.130
need in your application.

04:59.130 --> 05:02.120
And with that I hope this was helpful to you.
