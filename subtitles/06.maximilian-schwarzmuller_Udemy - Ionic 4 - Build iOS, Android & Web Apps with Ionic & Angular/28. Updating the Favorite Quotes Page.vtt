In the last lecture we saw something strange.

00:05.010 --> 00:13.580
If we have a favorite quote and we kind of unfavorite it it still is shown on the favorite quotes page.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.550
Only if we leave this page and come back Is it gone.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.250
Now why is that.

00:19.620 --> 00:26.970
The reason for this is that this page the favorite quotes page is not really rendered when we simply

00:26.970 --> 00:28.590
dismiss the modal.

00:28.590 --> 00:34.940
Keep in mind the modal simply is an overlay so if you take away the overlay.

00:34.980 --> 00:37.970
The page below it was just hidden.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.630
So it's not re rendered.

00:39.630 --> 00:41.610
It's not even taken from the cache.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.750
It really was just hidden.

00:43.770 --> 00:48.400
This is what we're not seeing that change here because the page is not pre-rendered.

00:48.630 --> 00:56.400
So in order to fix this we simply have to do as here in the place where we remove it from our favorite

00:56.400 --> 00:58.520
quotes array.

00:58.800 --> 01:06.780
We can simply reload our quotes so we could say these quotes and then simply get our quotes again.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.370
Get favorite quotes.

01:08.430 --> 01:14.850
Now of course an alternative would also be to simply search the selected quote In our quote cerate.

01:14.850 --> 01:17.070
So I'm going to show this alternative here too.

01:17.450 --> 01:26.640
So I'll store it in a Consta and maybe let's name that found quote and then of the X's are quotes array

01:26.720 --> 01:27.930
in this page.

01:27.970 --> 01:34.230
Disarray here at the top used the find index method again to find a quote.

01:34.310 --> 01:40.580
I know that I get the quote elements so that this function here is excellent for each quote in the array

01:40.670 --> 01:42.600
just as I explained before.

01:42.830 --> 01:50.070
And then here we can simply check if the quote element ID equals the ID of the selected quote.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.220
Like this.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.120
Right.

01:53.580 --> 02:01.080
And with that we can say this quotes splice.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.430
Maybe rename found quote to position instead.

02:04.580 --> 02:10.000
Start at the position of the quote we found remove exactly one element the one we found.

02:10.130 --> 02:15.640
And now if we say yes you should see that we correctly also remove the code.

02:15.650 --> 02:16.700
If we unfavorite it.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.590
So let's try this with another quote.

02:18.620 --> 02:21.840
This one your cyclic cancelled this one here.

02:22.130 --> 02:23.400
Click on unfavored.

02:23.450 --> 02:26.780
Now it's gone as soon as the modal disappears as you saw.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.770
Because now we're cleaning this up again.

02:28.790 --> 02:33.680
An alternative would be to simply reload all the quotes here but if you don't want to do this this is

02:33.710 --> 02:36.680
Dakotah simply remove a single quote.

02:36.680 --> 02:43.010
As a side note alternative would be to simply use index to find the position since Diskworld is of course

02:43.010 --> 02:46.720
taken from that code is an array so you could even shorten this a bit more.

02:46.790 --> 02:51.890
But the most important thing is not how to do this but that you need to update this because it's not

02:51.890 --> 02:57.510
done automatically because the page was only hidden not removed so it's not Riera entered.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.380
Now we're updating it though.
