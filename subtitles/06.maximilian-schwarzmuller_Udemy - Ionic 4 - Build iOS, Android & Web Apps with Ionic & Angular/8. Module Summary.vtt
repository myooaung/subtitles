00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.140
In this module we learn how to take our application configured for production and then actually publish

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.340
it to the Google Play Store.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.380
Anti-Apple AppStore now I just saw there are things which can go wrong but you also learned where you

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.210
should go in such a case to find out more and find a solution for the problem.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.010
You should now have all the pieces you need to build applications.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.710
Test them.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.610
And of course then after this section released them publish them and therefore possibly start earning

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.370
money with them or support your next project with such an application
