00:02.930 --> 00:06.260
Well let me first show you the app we're going to build in this section.

00:06.290 --> 00:09.480
It will cover a lot of the coord topics all face on it too.

00:09.560 --> 00:15.340
So you're going to learn a lot including different ways of navigating around and a lot of the components.

00:15.380 --> 00:21.800
I own two ships with you currently see a pretty empty screen here and that is normal because this app

00:21.800 --> 00:23.990
allows us to store our favorite quotes.

00:24.050 --> 00:25.900
And right now we don't have any.

00:26.120 --> 00:32.810
We can't go to the library though and there we are able to pick up from one of the many categories we

00:32.810 --> 00:33.270
have here.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.550
So let's take a motivational quote for example.

00:36.650 --> 00:40.280
Here we see two quotes and we can choose one.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.500
I really like this one here so let's favorite it.

00:43.730 --> 00:46.980
We get an alert that acts as if we really want to favorite it.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.720
I'll pick Yes.

00:48.770 --> 00:54.020
And after that you see that I could now unfavored it but I can also go back to my favorites and here

00:54.020 --> 00:56.710
you see this is my favorite quote.

00:56.930 --> 01:00.000
I can take a closer look to see the full quote here.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.700
And I can also unfavorite here auratus close that model.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.860
And we also get some settings.

01:05.870 --> 01:11.630
Well pretty basic settings but here we can switch to background to be an alternative background.

01:11.770 --> 01:15.440
And if I go back to the quotes now you see the color changed a bit.

01:15.530 --> 01:21.310
It's more in the orange yellowish direction now instead of the green we had before.

01:21.350 --> 01:23.150
You can see it if I switch it back.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.490
Now we're back to green.

01:24.770 --> 01:27.470
So let me unfavorite this quote disappears.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.140
And you can also see that here it's no longer saying unfavorite.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.080
Instead I can favorite it again.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.850
This is a quote we're going to build.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.430
So as you can see we get a lot of different pages.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.570
We're using tabs.

01:38.570 --> 01:41.280
We're using this site navigation here.

01:41.420 --> 01:45.660
We're storing some state our settings and which quotes you currently like.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.950
We're fetching some data to display the quotes here we're showing a list.

01:48.950 --> 01:49.840
We're using Aikins.

01:49.850 --> 01:54.380
We're using modals we're using dialogue's a lot of things are getting used here.

01:54.470 --> 01:58.300
So definitely something which really allows us to play around with.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.830
I want to dive deeply into it.

02:00.890 --> 02:01.640
Let's start
