00:02.260 --> 00:10.570
Before we add the upload let's provide another way of taking a picture here on a desktop device which

00:10.570 --> 00:11.340
has a camera.

00:11.350 --> 00:15.170
Because I mentioned that there is a package we can install to make this work.

00:15.310 --> 00:18.200
And I don't want to use my picture here if I don't have to.

00:18.220 --> 00:22.120
Would be better if we can use the camera here as well.

00:22.120 --> 00:29.170
And therefore let's go to the image picker and when I decide whether that picture should be used or

00:29.170 --> 00:37.900
not I can still render it here with use picture set to true but I actually don't want to force me to

00:37.900 --> 00:38.820
use that picture.

00:38.860 --> 00:45.550
I really only want to use it if the camera plugin is not available or if something fails here maybe

00:45.790 --> 00:52.300
if we catch an error here because we can't select an image like this then we might want to also use

00:52.360 --> 00:53.310
our picture here.

00:55.110 --> 00:59.420
So it used to follow pick a reference the native element there and click on it.

00:59.490 --> 01:02.640
However make sure that this exists before we do so.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.920
So if we have a picture of course you could always rendered that picture too but.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.520
But I also wanted to show how to use that platform.

01:10.200 --> 01:16.800
So now we're definitely rendering the picture on a desktop device running that app but we're not always

01:16.800 --> 01:18.170
using it we're just using it.

01:18.420 --> 01:25.140
If capacitor can't find a camera essentially and a debt on the other hand on my device here it's not

01:25.140 --> 01:26.130
the case.

01:26.130 --> 01:33.420
If I try to take an image here I get an error instead of the picture because camera modal percent is

01:33.420 --> 01:36.930
not a function data missing third party package I mentioned.

01:36.990 --> 01:39.030
So let's install that.

01:39.030 --> 01:43.970
The package I am talking about is called ionic slash P.W. a elements.

01:44.220 --> 01:52.890
So let's installed is in our project here with npm install dash dash save at ionic slash P.W. dash elements

01:53.390 --> 02:00.660
and this will install it here in its latest version and let's restart ionic surf there often once this

02:00.660 --> 02:07.440
is installed now we just need to import it and you can do that in your main test file for example there

02:07.460 --> 02:16.070
is simply add import where you import at ionic P.W. a elements just like that.

02:16.260 --> 02:21.650
This will unlock DPW a elements in your project you can all define this in the official box by the way

02:21.930 --> 02:29.650
there you have that P.W. a elements entry where you'll learn how to add and install it.

02:29.690 --> 02:37.160
Now one important note if you're still getting an error after importing that into main T.S. at this

02:37.160 --> 02:42.230
import which you all to find in the capacitor docks here this import here.

02:42.230 --> 02:50.010
Add this to your index not h t mail file then destroy definitely work in theory you should not require

02:50.010 --> 02:55.510
does offer adding does import here but if you do so if you're still getting an error try adding this

02:55.510 --> 02:59.920
import here with that added and saved here to Maine.

02:59.950 --> 03:08.790
Yes let's wait for it app to restart and now let's take picture and it should open this nice camera

03:08.820 --> 03:14.400
modal here where you can see me because this is now really my webcam how I'm sitting here recording

03:14.640 --> 03:21.990
and it looks a bit awkward due to how things are positioned so now I can take that picture confirm and

03:21.990 --> 03:28.380
here it is and this is now a way of also using the camera on devices that have a camera but are not

03:28.440 --> 03:33.720
native mobile phones now of course what you could still consider here is whether you want to show your

03:33.720 --> 03:39.150
own action sheet now where you prompt the user whether he wants to use a picture or that camera because

03:39.150 --> 03:46.200
right now you're always forcing the user to use that camera there is no picture though if I close it

03:46.200 --> 03:49.790
as you see and I canceled this I do get that picture again.

03:49.830 --> 03:57.890
So we do have that fallback here which is really convenient and therefore we even cover that case nonetheless

03:57.890 --> 04:04.070
it is of course worth asking in an action sheet if the user wants to pick or take an image upfront.
