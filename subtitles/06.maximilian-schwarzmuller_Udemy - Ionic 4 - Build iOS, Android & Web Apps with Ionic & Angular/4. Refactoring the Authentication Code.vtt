WEBVTT

00:02.310 --> 00:06.210
We add at the sign up method but of course we should improve it a little bit.

00:06.210 --> 00:11.640
First of all one thing I noticed is that on the off page for the button of course I want to swap the

00:11.640 --> 00:15.190
label and not say log in when we're signing up.

00:15.210 --> 00:22.140
But I want to say sign up so I'll check he is log in property and only if we are logging in then I will

00:22.230 --> 00:24.150
say log in here after.

00:24.150 --> 00:27.720
Otherwise I'll say sign up here but that's a minor thing.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.760
More importantly I want to show a spinner some loading indicator of Baltimore logging in and we got

00:32.760 --> 00:34.400
all the logic for that in place already.

00:34.410 --> 00:40.870
We got that loading controller injected and we already used this in on log in before now.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.670
Maybe we should recycle this method here.

00:43.980 --> 00:50.310
Name it authenticate and we'll be able to find out whether rural logging in or we're signing up because

00:50.310 --> 00:57.740
we're managing this in the is logging property here and then we can just grab our code from down there.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.620
Cut that where we sent that request and go up here and there.

01:01.620 --> 01:05.280
I've faked the log in process with set time out.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.130
Now I don't have to fake it anymore.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.800
I can use my off service.

01:08.940 --> 01:13.770
I just need to make sure that didn't authenticate I get my email and my password fields which are both

01:13.770 --> 01:20.040
strings so that I have that data because it turns out that for logging in we'll have to same sent the

01:20.040 --> 01:20.910
same data.

01:20.910 --> 01:25.160
So we definitely can manage this and wanted the same method.

01:25.170 --> 01:32.340
And then here instead of adding a timeout everything I had in there now simply goes into that place

01:32.340 --> 01:36.010
where I log my data because that is when I'm done signing up.

01:36.120 --> 01:45.180
So now I can remove that set timeout use authenticate and down there I will just call this authenticate

01:45.540 --> 01:52.090
and former and forward my email and password of course you could have all the logic and you on submit

01:52.090 --> 01:54.090
method two of you prefer that.

01:54.250 --> 01:58.990
Now we'll have to do one thing later though we'll have to make sure that we send the right request.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.580
Right now I'm always signing up.

02:00.970 --> 02:06.840
Well we soon might want to change this at all to log in occasionally but for now since we only implemented

02:06.840 --> 02:09.690
the sign up functionality let's go with that.

02:09.910 --> 02:12.550
We also saw that we can get an error.

02:12.730 --> 02:15.620
So we probably want to show this to the user as well.

02:15.790 --> 02:21.070
And therefore I'll inject the alert controller here alert controller like this.

02:21.070 --> 02:24.110
Of course imported from at ionic angular.

02:24.460 --> 02:31.030
And I want to show that alert whenever we have an error for this I'll add a new private method show

02:31.090 --> 02:31.660
alert

02:34.330 --> 02:40.630
where I expect to get a message which is a string and in there I'll use the alert controller to create

02:40.660 --> 02:48.160
a new alert where I'll set a header of authentication failed and the method which is the message I'm

02:48.160 --> 02:54.310
getting as an argument then of course we have a promise here where I get the alert element and then

02:54.310 --> 03:02.500
we simply present that element well and we also should add some buttons here so that we do actually

03:02.500 --> 03:04.410
provide a better user experience.

03:04.480 --> 03:11.420
Let's add buttons here where I say OK for example and that semicolon has to go to the end.

03:11.440 --> 03:18.180
So now we are all just showing that alert here or at least we added the functionality here.

03:18.190 --> 03:21.950
I now want to find out whether we had an error or not.

03:22.060 --> 03:26.200
And the good thing is we're right now handling the success case.

03:26.200 --> 03:32.170
Of course we can add the error case here to the subscribe method as well where we get that error object

03:32.920 --> 03:41.310
and we already saw what that error will look like we basically got an object which had a message property

03:41.520 --> 03:44.170
which had that error in it.

03:44.400 --> 03:49.620
But let's see it again real quick to validate the exact structure of the object we're getting.

03:49.710 --> 03:53.440
So now as reloads let's have a look.

03:53.480 --> 04:01.020
So I do try to create a user with that same e-mail address I already used I do get an error here and

04:01.020 --> 04:03.270
therefore my loading indicated right now doesn't go away.

04:03.270 --> 04:04.710
We'll fix this soon.

04:04.710 --> 04:11.790
Now that error here this is what logging actually has an error field itself and in there we have yet

04:11.790 --> 04:15.540
another error field in there we have that message.

04:15.540 --> 04:15.750
OK.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.780
So we get to dig into reader levels basically.

04:19.040 --> 04:26.340
Therefore all named as error response to have at least one error or less that I have to go in and then

04:26.730 --> 04:32.940
I can extract the message here were the code because the message isn't really a human readable message

04:32.940 --> 04:37.090
it's more like a code which you by the way all the fine in the docs there.

04:37.200 --> 04:43.500
You see common error codes you might get like e-mail not found in a password that's for signing in for

04:43.500 --> 04:49.170
signing up it's things like email exists and then you can manually handle that code.

04:49.170 --> 04:55.890
So here I get that code and I get that from error response error or error or we have to dig into these

04:55.890 --> 04:58.360
levels and then it's in the message field.

04:58.380 --> 05:03.390
Right so we're in error error message that is that code.

05:03.450 --> 05:13.110
Now we can create a human readable message here which medieval could be could not sign you up please

05:13.110 --> 05:14.010
try again.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.420
So some dummy message but then I'll all the.

05:16.440 --> 05:23.790
If chicken see if the code actually is email exists which is the most common reason for a log and fail

05:23.790 --> 05:32.330
or a sign up fail probably in that case we could add a more specific message of this email address already.

05:33.690 --> 05:42.500
Exists something like this and then thereafter we can call this show alert and pass on that human readable

05:42.500 --> 05:48.770
message regenerated and all of course make sure that you use that loading element and dismiss it here

05:48.860 --> 05:51.360
so that the loading indicator goes away.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.700
And now if we try creating a user who already exists.

05:54.710 --> 06:01.120
Again go to sign up here and lock that user in a sign that user up.

06:01.190 --> 06:02.920
I get that the error of medication failed.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.650
The e-mail address exists.

06:06.540 --> 06:10.720
And of course that should be exists already I guess.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.180
But that's a minor thing.

06:12.290 --> 06:16.130
If I now try email address that has not been taken yet.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.120
Like this.

06:17.860 --> 06:23.310
Then we successfully locked the user in so or create the user I should say.

06:23.530 --> 06:25.300
So that looks good.

06:25.300 --> 06:30.720
Now let's take care about logging in users which we all who we already created.
