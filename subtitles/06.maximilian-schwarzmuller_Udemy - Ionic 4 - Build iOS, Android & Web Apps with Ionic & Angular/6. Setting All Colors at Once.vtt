Now let me go back to the colors though.

00:04.290 --> 00:11.040
Obviously we have so many colors here and typically it is of course best if you set them all because

00:11.040 --> 00:15.450
they're all getting used in different places by the different built in components.

00:15.450 --> 00:22.530
So I don't automatically use as a contrast color in certain cases or the danger color in certain cases.

00:22.530 --> 00:28.470
So just setting one color as we're currently doing it is not really an option that will not really provide

00:28.470 --> 00:29.710
a nice look.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.030
So what can we do about that.

00:32.160 --> 00:38.040
Thankfully in the official box there also is a color Generator tool and this is a tool that allows you

00:38.040 --> 00:44.880
to generate all these colors nicely here in the browser and you only pick your nine main colors and

00:44.880 --> 00:52.770
then you can automatically copy and use this set of variables which is generated based on your selections.

00:52.770 --> 01:00.290
So all these contrast colors for your picked colors or the shaded colors so it's slightly darker awareness

01:00.300 --> 01:06.810
of your colors all these variables are generated automatically for you by just picking the main colors.

01:06.810 --> 01:12.630
So now here we can click on this color here and then open that color picker.

01:12.630 --> 01:17.010
And now here all choose this reddish color again as my main color.

01:17.220 --> 01:22.370
And then I click here to bring up that picture again and use a secondary color.

01:22.500 --> 01:36.600
Maybe that is a in the more or more in this area dark purple ish and my tertiary color is maybe even

01:36.600 --> 01:38.610
further in the purple area.

01:39.560 --> 01:49.240
And success should be greenish but maybe like this a slightly darker green could be that warning Yeah

01:49.260 --> 01:57.560
you're more of an orange color maybe danger let's all adjust is to be a bit more red and I'm happy with

01:57.560 --> 01:59.420
dark and medium and light.

01:59.420 --> 02:05.840
And once all of this is set and of course feel free to set up any styles that work for you or that you

02:05.840 --> 02:12.530
like once you're happy with the theme you can just copy down there and then go back to your code and

02:12.530 --> 02:18.650
that here just replace your entire root element here which sets up the colors for the entire app or

02:18.650 --> 02:22.220
the variables for an entire app with what you just copied.

02:22.400 --> 02:28.640
And now I have that nice set of colors with all the different shades and tints and therefore now is

02:28.640 --> 02:30.020
the Zap restarts.

02:30.020 --> 02:33.440
We'll have an application where all the colors work nicely together.
