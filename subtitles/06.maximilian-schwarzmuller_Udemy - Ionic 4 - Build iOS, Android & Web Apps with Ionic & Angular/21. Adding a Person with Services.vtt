To add a person, we need to get access to a service here in the person input component as well.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.580
Now definitely feel free to implement this on your own,

00:10.620 --> 00:15.120
you need to inject the service and then call the add person method.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.960
Here's your chance to pause the video and try it on your own and

00:17.990 --> 00:24.230
thereafter, we'll do it together. So were you successful?

00:24.230 --> 00:30.670
First of all, we don't need that property with @output anymore and we don't need to import output and

00:30.680 --> 00:39.980
emitter anymore therefore. Instead what we need here is a constructor, so that we can inject our persons

00:40.280 --> 00:47.420
service which is of type persons service and that is important and the import of persons service is also

00:47.420 --> 00:50.450
important. Now

00:50.540 --> 00:58.100
as a side note because that is actually not something you can take for granted by default, this persons

00:58.100 --> 01:04.670
service object we get here will be exactly the same object we get here and that simply happens because

01:04.670 --> 01:11.330
we defined this to be provided in root and that is the default and changing this behavior is beyond

01:11.330 --> 01:12.980
the scope of this refresher.

01:13.010 --> 01:21.430
It is something you can also learn in the official docs, here under dependency injection with these articles.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.720
You could overwrite this to have different objects but here, we want to have to same object actually, we

01:26.770 --> 01:28.210
want to have the same service

01:28.300 --> 01:33.810
so that we work on the same list of persons. Now in onCreatePerson,

01:33.810 --> 01:37.150
therefore I don't want to emit this person name anymore,

01:37.170 --> 01:46.240
instead I want to use my persons service and call add persons and pass this enteredPersonName and now

01:46.240 --> 01:53.440
in the persons service in add person, let's also console log this persons array to see if that worked.

01:54.400 --> 02:03.610
If we now save that and we will face the issue of not being able to navigate to that other component, we

02:03.610 --> 02:10.000
have no navigation bar, we can manually enter /input which is our other route and we do see it here

02:10.660 --> 02:17.920
and I can of course enter Michael here or any other name and hit create and in the console, you'll see

02:17.920 --> 02:24.670
that output and you see the array with Michael being added. So we see that this works but if I now remove

02:24.700 --> 02:30.370
this and go back, you'll not see Michael in the list because the app actually reloads when we manually

02:30.380 --> 02:37.760
change the URL. So we need some way of navigating around so we can finish up that dependency injection

02:37.760 --> 02:42.640
and service logic. So let's take a step back to routing in the next lecture.
