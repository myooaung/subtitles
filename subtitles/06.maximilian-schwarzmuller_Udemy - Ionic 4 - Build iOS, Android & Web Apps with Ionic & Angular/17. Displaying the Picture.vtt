In the last lecture we edit this camera a native feature and we were able to take a photo it should

00:06.630 --> 00:08.400
have worked on your device too.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.590
And we're storing it in some temporary part that's OK for now.

00:12.630 --> 00:19.740
But I want to use this image and now actually display it on my ADD place page and also store it in.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.800
Well my place object which we haven't read that at all.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.160
We finally want to finish our ad place method here.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.400
At least the basic words of it.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.850
So let's display it on the air.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.400
Place template here.

00:33.540 --> 00:39.900
We already have an image element where I try to bind source and try to enter some part of your time

00:39.900 --> 00:42.030
to use a real payoff.

00:42.240 --> 00:50.630
And I will wind to image your property which doesn't exist yet but which I will now implement.

00:50.820 --> 00:56.820
So here in the at place types could file or add a new property at the top image bureau and it should

00:56.820 --> 01:03.300
be empty or else empty string at the beginning because at the beginning I don't have any image with

01:03.300 --> 01:09.340
this I can now go down to the on take photo method and here I know that they will have the image right.

01:09.510 --> 01:11.330
So we can use this image.

01:11.550 --> 01:19.580
We can simply try setting this image Eurail equal to image data which we saw is the payoff to our image.

01:19.890 --> 01:27.800
So by doing this we should already see the image on our form here when we take one and saved as.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.510
So let's try this out.

01:29.610 --> 01:36.600
Let's save this and I'm going just going to run ionic run iOS device since I did run it in X code once

01:36.600 --> 01:38.880
and signed the app for development.

01:39.030 --> 01:44.910
So I'm going to run this to rerun my app and reopen it on my device and I'm going to mirror the screen

01:44.910 --> 01:46.830
for you since we should see a result.

01:46.830 --> 01:50.420
Now this is the app running on my device.

01:50.580 --> 01:54.230
Let's now go here and click on Open camera now and go.

01:54.250 --> 02:01.030
I'm going to take a picture here this one and click on use photo because I want to use that photo.

02:01.530 --> 02:07.980
And indeed here we can see the image which just took off the screen of my screen of my desktop screen

02:07.980 --> 02:08.580
here.

02:08.850 --> 02:13.070
So this is now getting added your tipoff get saved as you can see.

02:13.230 --> 02:15.010
We took a huge step forward.

02:15.120 --> 02:20.130
Now let's hook up this whole forum this whole page so that it can actually create a new place save it

02:20.310 --> 02:26.050
and then display it here on our list of our places where we don't have any list as of now.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.930
Let's do this in the next lecture
