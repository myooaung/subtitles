00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.650
We went through that page generation and navigation process a lot of times in this course.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.220
So when I go through that rather quickly here and I would generate all those pages together with you

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.310
using the command line tool you're Though of course you could use the manual approach.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.720
We're going to use four pages in total one page the home page I'll use this page you already have to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.510
store all our places to display them.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.800
Then we need a separate page for individual place if we tap on one detail page.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.360
I'm going to name this page place since it will be a single place we open in detail view then we will

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.270
also need a page to add a new place.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.680
So I'm going to name this page at place and the last page me to generate is the one where we are able

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.270
to pick a location on the map.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.480
You might remember that this opened a new page with the Google Maps interface on it.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.080
So here I will name this said location.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.740
Of course you are free to choose any other names but these are the four pages I'm going to work with

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.220
in this application.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.670
Now let's also add them to AB modules so that you are able to work with them.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:15.150
Here we of course need to add the ADD place page also adds the import of course and the same for the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.990
single place page which we added and the said location page the home page was already added.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.670
Make sure to add all those imports to and then also grab all those newly added pages and also add them

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.930
to entry components.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.980
So today on take to is able to find those pages as a next step.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.350
I want to set up some models.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.360
We're going to use this app to describe our data and the two models I want to create as one model for

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.340
our location and one for an individual place.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.000
Now you can try creating a game on your own though it might be best to do that together in the next

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.850
lecture because you might not know which features or which properties each of the two models should

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.310
have but definitely go ahead and try it on your own.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.170
You can always fine tune it to the needs of our app in the next lecture where we will do this to Gebre
