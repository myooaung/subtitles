00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.480
Last lecture we implemented geolocation to fetch the position of the user.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.340
But we didn't get any visual feedback was this fetching what's going on we didn't see that something

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.150
happened.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.760
So let's change this in order to change this.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.320
I'm going to go back to that place and I will display this loading view we saw before.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.860
So all import or inject your loading controller here and I will also already inject the TOSed control

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.140
because I want to show a message if the fetching of the location fails.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.400
So import both controllers from ionic angular year and and check them in the constructor.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.340
And with that added I can now go to on locate and will initialize the loader first.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.760
So stored it in a constant here or my loader using the loading controller asked before and then to create

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.490
Meffert and I will simply pass an object define the content of the loader which should be getting your

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.650
relocation or something like this.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.300
And then we can instantly present loader because you already start fetching a position here.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.850
Now if we fetch the position we of course want to stop the loader.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.450
So in this case I will access my loader and call the Smiths on it to remove it.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.400
And the same is of course the case if we get an error then we also don't want to show the loader anymore

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.960
in the error case.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.560
Also I want to show a message.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.750
So here I will treat a new alert excuse me a new new toast with the TOSed controller and to create Meffert

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:48.200
an endless Tempest all configure the message and the message should be could not get location please

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.890
Pequod manually or something like this.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.110
And I want to show this message over two and a half seconds.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.780
You could also add the position to default bottom so no need to add this.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.810
And when it does I can now pre-sent this toast.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.940
So that's a tiny little improvement but we should see that it really makes a difference.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.970
If we now restart our app let it rebuild gilled there pick on and click on locate me and we see that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.370
Spener.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.090
And after a couple of seconds it goes away and we see our map.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.950
So it is working fine.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.920
This works as it should work with that.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.370
Our first native feature was implemented.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.980
Let's next turn to the camera and see how we can implement this to access our device camera and take

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980
some photos.
