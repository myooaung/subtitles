00:02.070 --> 00:04.120
How can we pass data around.

00:04.350 --> 00:09.360
When we click on the buttons you are in the users page users component.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.600
We want to at the user page and we want to display the right name.

00:14.070 --> 00:17.180
Let's start in the users template here.

00:17.340 --> 00:23.430
On those buttons I will add a click listener and I will say on load user a method I still need to create

00:23.620 --> 00:25.760
and as an argument I will pass Max.

00:25.770 --> 00:31.150
In this case here and then I will copy that forward a second button and of course pass.

00:31.170 --> 00:32.400
Anna.

00:32.400 --> 00:40.350
Now with that in the component body I can create the onload user method and I know that the name will

00:40.350 --> 00:43.980
be passed here as a string of course.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.490
Now how do I load my user page and pass the data.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.640
We already learned how to load it.

00:50.790 --> 00:58.620
We need to add the constructor and inject something we need to inject the neph controller.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.410
Now you can name it whatever you want to name it.

01:01.650 --> 01:02.250
I'll name it.

01:02.250 --> 01:09.850
Neph control and it has to be of type nav controller which needs to be imported from ionic angler with

01:09.850 --> 01:15.640
this it's injected and it's automatically bound to a property named nav controller since I used these

01:15.640 --> 01:22.090
types of shortcut by placing private in front of it which also gives me a property of this name.

01:22.230 --> 01:29.790
So if dad in onload user I can use the nav controller to push a new page on the stack and the new page

01:29.790 --> 01:33.550
or one push of course is the user page here.

01:33.570 --> 01:35.970
Make sure to also imported.

01:36.570 --> 01:39.080
So this pushes a new page on the stack.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.960
But how do we also well pass on the data.

01:43.810 --> 01:47.760
Simply as the second argument and here we get two options.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.820
We can either simply pass the string.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.460
So name.

01:51.460 --> 01:57.410
Or we could of course all the pass and number whatever type you want or you can pass an object.

01:57.460 --> 02:01.060
And for example say user name name.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.630
So there's nothing wrong with just passing a name.

02:03.640 --> 02:08.610
But if you got more information to pass you probably will need an object.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.190
Or of course also an array.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.600
That's all the possible.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.050
With that I'm pushing this page on the stack.

02:15.070 --> 02:22.540
And I'm also adding some data to this action or two just pushing action so I'm passing some data to

02:22.540 --> 02:26.170
this newly pushed page in the user page.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.420
I now need to retrieve data.

02:28.830 --> 02:34.720
I do this by injecting something here though this time it's not the NAF controller.

02:34.720 --> 02:42.190
It's a average class and I will name the property neth Perens because the class is named Neph parents

02:42.280 --> 02:45.800
and it needs to be imported from ionic angler.

02:45.850 --> 02:52.330
So with this I'm now giving access to this naff parents class or to an instance of this class.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.980
And this allows me to retrieve the data.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.500
Now we could retrieve the data in the on in a lifecycle hook.

02:58.720 --> 03:07.330
So this normal angler to lifecycle look which we import from angler core which requires us to add Angi

03:07.360 --> 03:15.430
on in it here and in there I could say this name equals this Neph parents and then we have two ways

03:15.430 --> 03:23.140
of retrieving the data we can access the data property and this will be exactly the object or data we

03:23.140 --> 03:24.170
pass here.

03:24.310 --> 03:30.430
So right now it would be dead object but if we know did we get an object we can also use to get help

03:30.430 --> 03:35.270
or Befort and passed the name of the property we want to retrieve user name.

03:35.290 --> 03:38.620
So this will now give us the user name string here.

03:38.620 --> 03:43.760
So disvalue with this I'm assigning the value to the this name value.

03:43.900 --> 03:49.180
And just as a note we could have also done this in the constructor itself of course or in some other

03:49.180 --> 03:51.970
hook or place whenever we need to get this.

03:52.150 --> 03:55.060
However make sure to do it before the template gets rendered.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.510
Because remember in the template and outputting it.

03:58.960 --> 04:05.290
So if this were passing and retrieving data let's not save this the process is still running and let's

04:05.560 --> 04:08.880
see it in action to see how this works.

04:09.670 --> 04:17.450
So in Reloaded page can click on users and click on user Max you'll see Max up here and Haja Max here.

04:17.670 --> 04:21.470
If I go back and click on Anna you'll see the same with Anna.

04:21.490 --> 04:26.560
So this is how we can navigate around and also pass on and retrieve some data
