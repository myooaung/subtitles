00:02.140 --> 00:09.250
So that is enough of a refresher. I could dive way deeper into Angular but this is not an Angular course.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.310
I hope we're now on the same page regarding the basics

00:12.310 --> 00:17.460
and if this was brand new for you, you need to take a dedicated course as well.

00:17.740 --> 00:18.180
I hope

00:18.190 --> 00:24.130
I just refreshed your knowledge. Now Angular offers way more and there also is more you could refresh.

00:24.670 --> 00:28.780
Definitely dive into the official docs if there is anything which is still unclear

00:28.780 --> 00:35.470
to learn more about the architecture, how you can handle user inputs, how you can handle forms in a more

00:35.470 --> 00:42.580
complex way with validation and everything, more about dependency injection, about observables and

00:42.670 --> 00:43.540
rxjs,

00:43.780 --> 00:51.130
everything is covered here or of course, take a dedicated resource like my complete guide on Angular

00:51.220 --> 00:59.120
which takes you from novice to advanced Angular user in a very packed and in-depth way,

00:59.200 --> 01:07.020
so definitely check this out as well if you want to learn more about Angular. I hope the basics are set

01:07.020 --> 01:13.230
again now and with that, let's now proceed with the core of this course which is using Angular but which

01:13.230 --> 01:15.030
is not just about Angular.
