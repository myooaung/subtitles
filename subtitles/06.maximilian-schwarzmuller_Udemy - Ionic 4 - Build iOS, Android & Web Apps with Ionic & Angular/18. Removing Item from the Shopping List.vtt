00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.160
And The Last Lecture we added a method which allows us to add new items.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.780
Now I want to make sure that we're also able to remove items from this list and I want to remove them

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.790
simply by clicking on them by touching them.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.630
So if a touch item here I want to delete it I want to remove it from the list.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.930
Of course you can go more sophisticated.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.230
Add a slider here as shown in the first app where you learn how you can make your items slide up or

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.330
you could even go as sophisticated as adding edit Meffert so that when you touch them you load them

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.750
in the form to edit them and you can delete them by swiping.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.210
This is all possible and you learned how to do this in the last app.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.120
I'll stick with the very basics here and just make them delete double when clicking them.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.950
So in order to delete them when touching such item I'll go to my template and only an item I'll add

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.940
a click listener click because I want to react to any touch event.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.850
Of course if you're planning to implementing some swiping off that item and you want to loaded when

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.890
you tap it you should have GO course use tap here so that you're not loading the item for editing.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.680
If all you wanted to do is actually swipe it.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.360
Right.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.150
So here click is fine though and I would call on check.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.350
I am here because I had checked off the list kind of.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.100
You can also call it on remove or item I need to pass the index of the item in my array.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.370
Now since I'm getting a copy of my shopping list array anyways and I never manually add items to desirÃ©

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.830
which is why I decided for dissolution to get a new copy I know that the index of the item in disarray

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.490
and also the index I can retrieve on energy for it will be the same index as stored in the array in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.680
the shopping list service.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.220
Therefore I can use this addition to my engine for direct of your to get the index of this iteration

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.580
and store it in a variable.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.440
I'll name it I get it by assigning this reserved index word here.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.280
Index property that I'm getting the index of the item I'm looping through and not pasters to on check

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.770
item.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.880
And in the shopping list types could file I will therefore add this new method on check item and I know

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.910
that they'll get the index of the item here which is a number or which can be cost to a number.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.710
And with this index I can then call my shopping service call remove item and pass the index to that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.440
service.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.130
And of course thereafter I ever call this load items because it changed something about the shopping

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.370
list array and therefore I need to reload it here.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.660
So with this if I saved this and let the app recompile Let's see this in action.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.960
I'll add some bread here and then also some honey let's say one.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.040
And now if I delete the bread by simply clicking on it it's gone.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.920
And now I only got honey on the list.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.470
And now that's gone too.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.280
And with that the basic shopping list is finished.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.340
We're able to add items removed them interviewed them here.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.720
As I mentioned before.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.880
Feel free to take this extra challenge of changing the behavior a bit so that when you tap on an item

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.870
you load it here to be editable you will need to adjust your energy model here and probably and change

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.560
your form in general and that you maybe also include some swiping that you can reveal like a trash can

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.140
when swiping the item which allows you to remove it.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.140
That would all be some improvements but including things you should know from Engler to or covered in

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.000
the first ep.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.810
So I'm eager to move on to the Recipes page and work on that to show you how to create a more complex

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.840
form with different input elements and using the reactive approach in angler to
