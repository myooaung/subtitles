00:02.290 --> 00:09.460
Inside of that content, I went to have my input fields and a button to submit whatever the user entered

00:09.470 --> 00:18.250
so to say. Now again, you can dive into the official docs to find out that there also is an ion-input

00:18.790 --> 00:20.130
and you learned how to use that,

00:20.140 --> 00:26.200
how to configure it and how you can combine it with a label for example, inside of an ion-item as it

00:26.200 --> 00:30.610
turns out, to have a label next to it that behaves in a certain way,

00:30.610 --> 00:36.220
for example it floats up when you click into the input. So we can also copy that code snippet to add

00:36.220 --> 00:44.440
a couple of components at the same time and drop it in here and turn the link up there in a self-closing

00:44.440 --> 00:50.100
tag just so that I get auto-completion back and I can reorganize the code automatically with a shortcut,

00:50.500 --> 00:54.250
so that's all I did here, change the link to self-close itself.

00:54.250 --> 01:00.400
So back to what we added, we added the ion-item here with a label of position floating and the text on the

01:00.400 --> 01:04.440
label here should actually say expense reason

01:04.510 --> 01:09.620
let's say, you can of course enter any text you want and below that, I'll have an ion-input

01:09.730 --> 01:13.150
where I'll set the type attribute to text,

01:13.180 --> 01:17.200
of course you'll find that in the official docs that you can do that.

01:17.290 --> 01:25.310
And if I now save that and I reload the app, we see our input here, where I can enter an expense reason.

01:26.310 --> 01:28.180
Now that is sweet,

01:28.290 --> 01:39.450
let's also add another input below it where I will say expense amount and here this will be of type

01:40.360 --> 01:41.370
number

01:41.820 --> 01:46.800
because users should only be able to enter numbers here. If we save that and we reload,

01:46.860 --> 01:49.900
we see that second input below the first one.

01:50.070 --> 01:51.410
So that is nice

01:51.510 --> 01:59.070
but what if we actually would want to wrap this in, let's say a little box instead of having it go across

01:59.070 --> 02:04.350
the full width of the screen which looks especially strange on bigger screens?

02:04.380 --> 02:10.530
Well that is no problem, we can put it into a so-called card and you might know this card look from other

02:10.530 --> 02:12.620
pages, it's pretty popular these days,

02:12.750 --> 02:17.730
as always you learned how to use it here in the official docs.

02:17.820 --> 02:26.250
We can just add an ion-card element here and then take whatever should be in there and not add it directly

02:26.250 --> 02:31.830
in it like this but add ion-card content, again something you learn with the help of the official

02:31.830 --> 02:35.630
docs or in this course now and in that ion-card content,

02:35.640 --> 02:44.010
I have my ion-items. Now inside of the ion-card but outside of the ion-card content, I'll also add

02:44.040 --> 02:50.700
another element supported by Ionic which is the ion-card-header and this allows us to set up a nice

02:50.700 --> 02:58.050
title in there by adding an ion-card title inside of that ion-card-header and I'll just add a title

02:58.050 --> 03:04.570
of new expense here. Now with that ion-card added to the app here,

03:04.690 --> 03:11.710
if we now reload, we have this nice card look with our input sitting in that box here which is quite

03:11.710 --> 03:18.580
neat in my opinion. It still spans across the full width on bigger screens though,

03:18.590 --> 03:21.070
so what can we do about that?
