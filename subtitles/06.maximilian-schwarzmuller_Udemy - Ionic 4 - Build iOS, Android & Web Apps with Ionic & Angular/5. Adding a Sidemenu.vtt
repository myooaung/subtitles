WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:08.920
So where are you successful let's implement the side menu together in the app HMO files so any template

00:08.920 --> 00:13.240
of our root component here I want to implement is side menu.

00:13.270 --> 00:19.340
So I'm going to add D and menu element here which is the wrapper for our menu.

00:19.390 --> 00:25.860
And you may remember that IDE menu has this content property we need to bind where we basically Tallaght.

00:25.960 --> 00:32.040
Well where should you render your reconned and where should you place yourself over.

00:32.050 --> 00:33.910
So where should you be an overlay to.

00:34.090 --> 00:36.610
And this will be the identifier.

00:36.610 --> 00:43.120
So I'm going to give it as a reference of NAV and then I'm going to add those are passed as reference

00:43.120 --> 00:48.780
as an argument to this property bind and here to tell it well this menu belongs to this navigation Steg.

00:48.910 --> 00:55.450
And when we open the menu it should be shown above this navigation stack inside of the menu.

00:55.450 --> 01:01.840
I want to have a header with a toolbar inside of it again no nav bar because we don't need any navigation

01:01.840 --> 01:07.080
features in there only want to toolbar look and then the title.

01:07.210 --> 01:09.450
Now hearable simply say menu again.

01:09.580 --> 01:14.830
The more interesting part obviously is the iron content of this menu which allows us to implement all

01:14.830 --> 01:17.770
the features we need are all those buttons we need.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.650
For this I will use the I list to structure the content.

01:20.650 --> 01:27.130
Again you are free to use any other layout you want or you could use the grid or whatever you need whatever

01:27.130 --> 01:30.810
you think it looks nice and InDesign list.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.380
I'm going to add a couple of buttons.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.190
Let's start with one button.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.910
This button receives the item directive to look like a list item in this last year.

01:39.970 --> 01:42.550
It will also hold I can this is wollop.

01:42.580 --> 01:48.110
Well at the Iken left directive to indicate that the eye can should be placed on the left.

01:48.370 --> 01:52.720
And of course I will need a click listener to do something when to click this button.

01:52.720 --> 01:58.630
Now I want to execute the on load method and it will repeat or I've already used this method for all

01:58.630 --> 01:59.670
my buttons here.

01:59.810 --> 02:05.950
Therefore what I want to pass here is the page I actually want to load and this first button here should

02:06.010 --> 02:09.580
actually lead to the recipe book or to our app.

02:09.580 --> 02:13.570
So the page I want to load here is my tap's page.

02:13.750 --> 02:20.950
So this is a property I will need to create or I can already change route page year to tap's page like

02:20.960 --> 02:27.820
this and with that change of course and each are adjusted down here Saddam is simply restructuring this

02:27.840 --> 02:29.960
because there is no single root page anymore.

02:29.990 --> 02:34.090
It depends on our authentication state or at least it will depend on this soon.

02:34.280 --> 02:39.440
So I want to load the tabs page this property which holds a reference to our taps page if I click the

02:39.500 --> 02:40.840
first button.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.250
Now as I mentioned this will not be the only button we're going to have moral options.

02:45.410 --> 02:49.510
The next option I want to present is DS sign in page.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.040
Now again this will only be shown in the same menu Temperley.

02:54.170 --> 03:00.830
Later we're going to add some logic to show either the recipe book or log out button if we're authenticated

03:01.130 --> 03:04.070
or did you sign in and sign out buttons.

03:04.070 --> 03:08.730
If we're not fan dictated for now I'm going to show all those options at all the time.

03:08.780 --> 03:15.500
So here for a sign in it I of course also need to replace this I'm no longer pointing to the taps page

03:15.500 --> 03:21.210
and said Here I want to load sign in page and this property doesn't exist so let me quickly create a

03:21.200 --> 03:26.050
two year sign in page ship point to the sign in page here.

03:26.150 --> 03:30.090
Make sure to also import is reference to the page.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.700
And then I can duplicate this one more time.

03:33.770 --> 03:39.770
But before I do this I actually want to change the content of the button because I said I want to have

03:39.770 --> 03:40.920
all I can in there right.

03:41.120 --> 03:47.270
So let's add I an icon element and I already picked some fitting icons but it can always these used

03:47.280 --> 03:49.640
as I can repository to find your favorite.

03:49.650 --> 03:58.350
I can for the first pop in here for your recipe book I want to use that book item I can here and forward

03:58.700 --> 04:00.770
sign in button here.

04:00.800 --> 04:08.090
I actually also found a fitting I can so let's add I and I can here with a name of log in.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.010
Very creative right.

04:09.020 --> 04:15.250
But there's is the log in I can looks very nice there for as it is the content of this button.

04:15.260 --> 04:20.270
With that I'm going to repeat this button two more times to copy it two more times.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.530
The first part of the two new buttons here will point to the sign up page.

04:25.610 --> 04:31.070
This property all needs to be created here in the app component therefore to make it work.

04:31.070 --> 04:40.010
Sign up page also at this import and of course I want to say sign up as a caption here and change log

04:40.040 --> 04:40.970
into.

04:41.120 --> 04:46.330
And here I found the person I can look really nice of course again.

04:46.340 --> 04:47.300
Choose your favorite.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.000
I can.

04:48.240 --> 04:54.590
Well and then lastly the last year should allow us to lock the user out here.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.340
De-funding icons do you log out.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.430
I can and I actually don't want to execute on load here.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.580
I want to execute on lock out.

05:02.690 --> 05:06.220
Now I haven't implemented on load and I haven't implemented on lock out.

05:06.290 --> 05:07.660
We'll do this in a second.

05:07.910 --> 05:13.220
But before doing this let's also remember that we need to hook up the two new pages we created sign

05:13.220 --> 05:14.460
in and sign up.

05:14.480 --> 05:22.820
So let's go to the app module and at the sign in page here Aunty's sign up page at both 2-D declarations

05:22.820 --> 05:25.370
aere and at their imports at the top.

05:25.610 --> 05:31.570
And then of course you also need to add them to your entry components as they are loaded through ionic

05:31.580 --> 05:32.870
too.

05:32.900 --> 05:39.200
Now with this does set up this menu is configured though it's not finished.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.730
We have no way of showing it.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.750
And again on load and on Lagat are not implemented.

05:45.050 --> 05:51.470
So let me implement on load first on log out will follow later because we can't do that as of now we

05:51.470 --> 05:57.920
haven't implemented any authentication logic in the app component itself and the typescript code here

05:57.920 --> 06:00.580
I'm going to add the on load method.

06:00.830 --> 06:08.390
And I know that the argument will be a property which holds the page I want to load or will be the page

06:08.390 --> 06:08.770
itself.

06:08.780 --> 06:14.610
So we're passing all those properties as arguments here and that of course will be the individual references

06:14.660 --> 06:15.730
this property stores.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.010
Right.

06:16.010 --> 06:19.050
So the taps page silane page or sign up page reference.

06:19.100 --> 06:24.530
This is what we will receive here does page reference and therefore here what I want to do is a one

06:24.530 --> 06:25.930
to navigate.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.190
Now we already learned in the first ep that we can't use the nav controller in the component because

06:31.250 --> 06:36.230
the navigation has not been initialized at the point of time this component is created.

06:36.230 --> 06:36.770
Right.

06:36.770 --> 06:39.510
So injecting it in a constructor won't work.

06:39.530 --> 06:46.910
Instead we have to get a reference by using at view child and make sure to import view child from an

06:46.940 --> 06:48.380
angle or core.

06:48.440 --> 06:56.420
We have to get a reference to dis INFP component which will be or which is our template representation

06:56.600 --> 06:58.090
of the NAAFA controller.

06:58.190 --> 07:04.520
And therefore when we get viewed Schult this will have been initialized because this happens later and

07:04.520 --> 07:07.760
not at the point of time we create this component.

07:07.760 --> 07:15.050
So a year I'm passing now as a string to reference this Neph local reference here on this element.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.310
And with that we're getting access to this element.

07:17.450 --> 07:23.270
I'm going to store it in property named Neph and it will be of type Neph controller.

07:24.220 --> 07:31.300
So make sure to assign this type and imported from ionic angular up here with this reference.

07:31.390 --> 07:39.490
Stuart I can now go to onload and use NAV to set the route page year and XEDIT to the page to the reference

07:39.490 --> 07:42.460
of the page we're getting here as an argument.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.280
Also I want to close the menu.

07:44.290 --> 07:51.250
If we load and you page 4 days I will need to inject something which I can inject at this point of time.

07:51.320 --> 07:58.840
The menu controller of type menu controller which you should import from ironic Engler to end with is

07:58.840 --> 07:59.570
imported.

07:59.620 --> 08:06.100
I can not only change the route page but also close the menu which probably is open at this point of

08:06.100 --> 08:07.080
time.

08:07.090 --> 08:12.790
So with that we implemented on load I will already add on log out but I will leave it empty for now

08:12.880 --> 08:16.450
again because we haven't added any authentication logic to this page.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.730
Therefore it would be kind of hard to lock the user out right.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.560
He's not even locked in.

08:21.610 --> 08:27.050
So with this out of the way the missing piece is the button to open the menu.

08:27.050 --> 08:32.700
Now this leads us to the question where do we want the user to be able to open the menu.

08:34.140 --> 08:41.240
Well I'd say the user should be able to open the menu from all major components or pages.

08:41.250 --> 08:47.910
So from the recipes page here where we output all the recipes and already have this plus I can to create

08:47.910 --> 08:49.460
a new recipe.

08:49.560 --> 08:55.530
And in the shopping list page on this page here these are the two pages we're whipping nice to allow

08:55.530 --> 08:57.990
the user to switch to page.

08:58.020 --> 09:03.170
Oh and also on sign in and sign up of course because otherwise we have no chance of leaving those pages.

09:03.180 --> 09:10.220
So those four pages are pages where we should be able to open the menu for a button in the nav bar.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.620
Now we've already learned how to implement such a button in the first app we built.

09:14.640 --> 09:20.520
So this is again a nice challenge for you to go ahead and add such a menu toggle button in the four

09:20.520 --> 09:22.540
pages mentioned a few seconds ago.

09:22.820 --> 09:26.490
I'll give you a chance to pause the video and we'll do this together thereafter.

09:29.760 --> 09:34.080
So were you successful let's add these toggle button together.

09:34.170 --> 09:36.980
I'll start in the recipes page here.

09:36.990 --> 09:43.270
We already have all Ion's buttons lock but this one places the button at the end.

09:43.410 --> 09:50.100
I want to add a new buttons block which places the button at the start of the nav bar so on the left

09:50.700 --> 09:58.370
and just as trivia if you wondered why it's called Start and End and not left and right start and end

09:58.670 --> 10:01.890
is not necessarily the same on all platforms.

10:02.190 --> 10:05.540
Start in and we'll adopt to the platform it runs on.

10:05.550 --> 10:08.930
So that for example if start means on the left for iOS.

10:08.940 --> 10:12.980
But on the right for Android it places it correctly.

10:12.990 --> 10:19.380
So if you play start it will place it always on what this platform considers as the start.

10:19.380 --> 10:23.720
This is why we have this naming just as a side note.

10:23.940 --> 10:28.900
So with this let's add a button to the end buttons block we just created.

10:28.950 --> 10:33.770
Let's add the button directive of course and then I can only because it will only be.

10:33.780 --> 10:34.530
I can.

10:34.890 --> 10:41.070
And with this or on this button I want to have an icon with the name of menu.

10:41.130 --> 10:48.360
There's this nice menu icon are also at the menu toggle directive to have an easy way of opening and

10:48.360 --> 10:50.930
closing this menu and that's all we need.

10:50.940 --> 10:56.740
Now with that I'm going to copy this block and also add it to my shopping list here to have a menu talk

10:56.740 --> 10:57.750
the button there.

10:57.900 --> 11:03.900
And on the seinen page you're going to remove this comment I'm going to add this to and replace this

11:03.900 --> 11:08.120
as with a capital as we're going to work more on these pages later.

11:08.160 --> 11:15.120
Also on the sign up page remove that add a capital S year and then add this button block going to save

11:15.120 --> 11:15.510
it.

11:15.530 --> 11:18.490
D I only serve Prozess is already running.

11:18.540 --> 11:24.090
Therefore if I now go to this page and let it reload we see the menu here on the top left and both the

11:24.090 --> 11:26.240
recipes and the shopping list page.

11:26.430 --> 11:33.710
If we open it we see our four choices and we can go to the sign in page to design a outpolls page can

11:33.770 --> 11:34.490
click log out.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.330
Nothing happens there of course we haven't eliminated any logic.

11:37.530 --> 11:42.540
And we can go back to the recipe book which of course loads to shopping list since again recipe book

11:42.630 --> 11:47.430
will load our Tapps component and their first step is the shopping list.

11:47.430 --> 11:51.250
So this is working as intended with that we added are a side menu.

11:51.250 --> 11:57.210
We are now able to work on the look of sign up and signing component before we don't actually add d

11:57.210 --> 11:58.500
of indication or logic
