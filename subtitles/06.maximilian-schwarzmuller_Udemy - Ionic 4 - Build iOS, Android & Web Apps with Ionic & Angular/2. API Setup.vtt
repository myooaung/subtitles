00:02.190 --> 00:08.100
The first thing we want to do is we want to set up our Google Maps API keys because we need a key to

00:08.100 --> 00:10.050
be able to work with that API.

00:10.050 --> 00:16.140
It is not a public API that we can use without a key for it and you can search for Google Maps API and

00:16.140 --> 00:21.710
you'll find a couple of results and you can go to dad maps javascript API.

00:21.840 --> 00:28.950
Now on that page here you can learn basically everything about using the Google Maps Javascript SDK

00:28.980 --> 00:35.340
and API and DST K is basically the tool sets that allows you to write code that displays and manage

00:35.340 --> 00:41.730
a city map in your application and the API is what works behind the scenes and to which your Google

00:41.730 --> 00:44.670
Maps Javascript SDK connects automatically.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.830
That is why I use these terms interchangeably.

00:47.880 --> 00:53.210
So what we'll need to do to use Javascript SDK is we need to set up an API key.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.750
Now let me also emphasize that will of course not use everything you find here.

00:57.750 --> 01:03.690
We'll actually only use a subset of the features you could use with Google Maps and therefore definitely

01:03.690 --> 01:09.570
check out these docs here if you want to build an application that relies way more on google maps than

01:09.570 --> 01:11.020
ours does.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.780
So our first step is to get an API key here on the left side.

01:15.030 --> 01:19.040
And for that here you can see you must enable billing.

01:19.040 --> 01:25.790
Now that is a thing you need a Google account and you need to enable billing in that account.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.700
Now what does this mean is does API not for free.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.960
Can you not use it for free.

01:31.980 --> 01:36.690
Well if you go to the ad maps Chow's script API usage and billing page you can learn more about that

01:37.110 --> 01:38.260
and you'll learn that.

01:38.340 --> 01:45.150
You basically are built but there is a free quota and dead free quota is pretty generous.

01:45.150 --> 01:48.770
So you actually can use the API for free.

01:48.780 --> 01:55.980
For example you get 200 dollar credit every month and dad suffices for a lot of requests.

01:56.010 --> 02:03.690
You can see what a request costs down there but it is worth noting that it is generally not for free.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.880
You need a Google map.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.120
You need a Google account and a credit card.

02:07.230 --> 02:11.940
And if you don't have that you unfortunately can't use Google Maps API anymore.

02:11.940 --> 02:15.080
You can of course look for alternatives like map blocks.

02:15.180 --> 02:16.300
In this case.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.900
So that is the billing part with Dad.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.450
Let's go back here and assuming you have a Google account and you set up billing there.

02:23.610 --> 02:28.340
You can get an API key by clicking on get started here on there.

02:28.350 --> 02:30.930
Get an API key section.

02:30.930 --> 02:38.520
This takes us to this page and there you can choose the maps box here and you see which API is will

02:38.520 --> 02:42.150
now be unlocked and that is the maps javascript API which we need.

02:42.240 --> 02:49.560
It is all of the maps static API which we will use as well and we will actually also need the places

02:49.980 --> 02:56.120
box here because we will use the geo coding API as well for converting coordinates into an address.

02:56.460 --> 03:03.000
So make sure to pick these two sections here and continue after you want to choose a project and you

03:03.000 --> 03:09.420
can actually select your firebase project here as I did and you have to agree to these terms and now

03:09.420 --> 03:11.880
these API will be enabled for you.

03:11.880 --> 03:17.860
This now takes you to d developer console where you are prompted for a couple of things.

03:18.450 --> 03:19.800
And you're done now.

03:19.800 --> 03:26.400
This is the API key which you'll have to use when you actually import the Javascript SDK into your project

03:26.910 --> 03:29.700
and that is the part where we will continue in the next lecture.
