00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.510
As always let's start by seeing what we're actually going to build does this the application running

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.010
on my own iPhone.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.260
So I'm just mirroring the screen again.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.410
And as you can always see I implemented one major new feature into this recipe app.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.140
We now have to authenticate in order to use it.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.880
So by default we start a design in screen but as you can see I also got the side menu which allows me

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.790
to switch to sign up to create a new user.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.890
Now it turns out I already have a user so I'm going to go back to the sign in screen and here I'm going

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.190
to enter my dummy testing data into this and also my password.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
And with that enter I can hit seinen this will assign me a message told me and now I'm in the Recipe

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.260
Book.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.390
This is the app as we saw it before.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.740
Well I got this new extra message here that we get no recipes.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.700
But there also is one additional feature if you look at the top right corner.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.310
You see those free dots which let me open these pop out menu here or pop over menu or this and here

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.260
it can actually store and load my app data.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.340
Now let's see if I already got a shopping list stored on the server.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.810
I'll hit this wait a couple of seconds.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.090
And here we go.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.450
Looks like I've already saved some shopping lists data on a server.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.310
Now let's see if we also already got some recipes there.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.760
I'm going to load that and yes I got a schnitzel.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.970
So does this data actually stored on a server and not on my mobile phone anymore.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.880
Now if I delete the recipe here and I had a load again.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.320
Well it obviously gets reloaded because again it's stored on the server.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.900
Only if I delete it here and then it's safe.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.470
I'm saving those changes.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.900
And now if I load again I can't fetch it anymore because I saved by changes to the server and therefore

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.460
I deleted that there too.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.150
And of course I can still also create some new recipe like the famous spaghetti I used all the time

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.670
which are also very tasty I guess where I might also add an ingredient like let's say spaghetti themselves

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.350
like this.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.630
And now if I saved his new recipe and I hit save list well I can of course.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.160
Whoops.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.520
First delete that recipe and then it load again to fetch it again from the server.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.390
So this is our awesome new functionality added to the application.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.200
We can now use both authentication to prevent unauthorized access to this recipe book.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.810
And then we can store our recipes on our own account kind of on the server.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.150
Now for this application I'm going to use firebase which is very easy to use out of the box working

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.860
back end.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.970
But of course you will be able to implement this logic with any back end of your choice.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.440
I'd say let's dive into this and let's start working on this cool new feature
