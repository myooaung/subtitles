00:02.390 --> 00:07.450
Are you a successful let's implement our form and I'll start with the template here.

00:07.450 --> 00:11.560
But of course it's up to you with which part you start.

00:11.560 --> 00:18.220
Now I will copy parts of the new offer form but not the entire template because I'll not have entirely

00:18.220 --> 00:26.890
the same logic so I will copy the entire form element here but then I will delete a bunch of stuff.

00:27.070 --> 00:30.880
So let's copy that in and now let's go through that.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.420
I want to be able to edit the title so that we'll stay here.

00:34.420 --> 00:40.390
I want to be able to edit the description so Dad will stay here too but all the rest the price and the

00:40.390 --> 00:44.430
dates ends on all of that will simply be deleted.

00:45.590 --> 00:51.470
Now of course I've got a bunch of arrows here because we for one haven't enabled reactive forms here

00:51.470 --> 00:54.370
and b we haven't set up any form and typescript.

00:54.530 --> 00:58.470
So let's start with enabling it here in the edit offer module.

00:58.490 --> 01:04.050
We don't need the normal forms module we need to be reactive forms module and d reactive.

01:04.070 --> 01:09.740
For this module which we add here has to be imported from at angular forums where you can remove the

01:09.740 --> 01:11.590
forms module import though.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.360
And now we can start creating that form here in the edit for page typescript file.

01:17.360 --> 01:23.270
So here we are already getting the place from the service with the I.D. we got out of the U R L that's

01:23.270 --> 01:24.050
good.

01:24.110 --> 01:31.400
Now here I'll just add my form which is of type form group which has to be imported from at Angola.

01:31.420 --> 01:38.940
Forms and I want to initialized as an NGO on it and of course have what I initialized this after I got

01:38.940 --> 01:40.650
my place from the service.

01:40.710 --> 01:45.260
So offered this line but important inside of this function we passed.

01:45.260 --> 01:53.730
To subscribe if you try to initialize your form here after this subscribe call then what you'll do is

01:53.820 --> 01:59.340
you'll actually try to initialize it before the subscription is done and before it actually gave you

01:59.340 --> 02:05.520
this value and therefore you'll try to work with a place that hasn't been set yet because this year

02:05.580 --> 02:11.760
runs asynchronously so in order to use that data you have to added You have this form initialization

02:11.910 --> 02:14.710
in the same asynchronous function handler here.

02:15.420 --> 02:22.980
So in there I will create a new form group as it did before pass a javascript object and add title and

02:22.980 --> 02:27.450
description and I will basically initialize this just as before.

02:27.450 --> 02:34.170
So you can go over to the new offer component and there I will copy title and description D2 controls

02:34.710 --> 02:37.250
and use them here in this form group.

02:37.260 --> 02:43.620
The difference however is the default value and by the way we now also need to import form control and

02:43.620 --> 02:47.660
validators of course year from at Anglo forms.

02:47.660 --> 02:54.080
But the difference I wanted to talk about is the starting value the starting value is now not no but

02:54.080 --> 02:57.440
since we're editing a place it should be the current value.

02:57.440 --> 03:04.890
So here I will added this place title where I will add this as a starting value.

03:04.960 --> 03:14.000
And here it's this place description now we're initializing the form and now we can go back to the Template

03:14.630 --> 03:21.500
disconnection so all this markup here and directives where we connect the inputs here in the form to

03:21.500 --> 03:24.620
our tax code should now be working.

03:24.620 --> 03:25.780
So let's give this a try.

03:26.210 --> 03:31.820
If you go back to this page reloaded and it correctly populated the title and the description with the

03:31.820 --> 03:36.450
values of this place missing thing now is simply is dead.

03:36.450 --> 03:41.970
We add a button that allows us to confirm our edits and for that I'll bring back the check mark I have

03:41.980 --> 03:43.100
on the other page.

03:43.140 --> 03:49.080
So in the new offer page I'll copy that I and buttons part from the toolbar and add it to the added

03:49.110 --> 03:50.100
offer page.

03:50.100 --> 03:56.980
And yes of course you could think about using one page for both types of place editing or of offer editing.

03:57.030 --> 04:01.430
I split it up deliberately here to make it very clear where we're managing what.

04:01.590 --> 04:06.990
But you can certainly think about merging them into one component so that you can reuse more of your

04:06.990 --> 04:08.510
code and off your templates.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.560
I'm fine with some duplication here though.

04:11.730 --> 04:16.070
So I have my eye and buttons added to the toolbar of the added offer page.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.680
Now on create offer doesn't sound like a fitting name though.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.680
I'll name it on update offer.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.820
And of course this method now needs to be added to the added offer page.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.200
Other than that this can stay as it is here.

04:30.240 --> 04:41.650
So let's now add on update offer and first of all here I'll check if not this form is valid.

04:41.650 --> 04:43.810
So if it's invalid then I'll return.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.010
And this by the way is a check.

04:45.010 --> 04:47.100
We should also add and add new all four page.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.250
Now did I think about it.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.860
So let's add it here as well.

04:50.860 --> 04:58.270
But now back to the edit offer page in there I now simply want to console log this form and that is

04:58.270 --> 04:59.110
all for now.

04:59.110 --> 05:04.510
Again will add logic to actually update this in the service at that even later updated on a real server

05:04.780 --> 05:06.790
throughout this course.

05:06.790 --> 05:13.630
Back here I have to check mark and if I press it I got my value here with the description and title

05:13.630 --> 05:20.260
that we pre entered and if I now clear the title here and I click out of that because we're updating

05:20.260 --> 05:26.120
on blur indeed this button gets disabled and does this now invalid there enter something valid again.

05:26.230 --> 05:28.830
Now we can see that this was picked up here in the value.

05:29.260 --> 05:34.210
So this is how we can added our offer or how we at least can gathered user input for that.
