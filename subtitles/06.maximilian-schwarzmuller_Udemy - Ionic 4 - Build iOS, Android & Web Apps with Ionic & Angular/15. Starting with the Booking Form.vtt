00:02.320 --> 00:03.350
So we're nearing the end.

00:03.350 --> 00:09.710
What's missing is that we can book a place right now if you book we get this action bar and here in

00:09.710 --> 00:15.860
this motel I want to render a nice forum that allows a user to enter some booking details like let's

00:15.860 --> 00:20.850
say a first name a last name the number of guests that will stay here.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.580
I mean I'll name this app pair B and B.

00:23.630 --> 00:27.960
But maybe you want to bring an extra guest for more fun or whatever.

00:28.100 --> 00:33.530
So let's say you can pick more than Q people let's say you can pick if you're coming alone because you're

00:33.530 --> 00:40.910
a pretty sad pair or you're coming with your partner or you're coming with your partner and a good friend.

00:41.330 --> 00:48.080
So I wanna have a dropdown that allows us to pick the number of guests and also of course want to render

00:48.350 --> 00:56.720
some date inputs here where we can pick the range in which we want to stay at this place.

00:56.720 --> 01:02.810
So that will be the form that I want to build here and I will build it entirely with the template driven

01:02.810 --> 01:04.870
approach.

01:04.910 --> 01:09.840
Let's go back to code and let's have a look at the model here.

01:09.890 --> 01:17.330
That is our create booking page here of course where we have to book button right now and only the place

01:17.390 --> 01:18.770
description up here.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.560
I don't care so much about the description.

01:21.580 --> 01:29.240
Instead now it's about rendering a nice form for that form here on the create booking page or this component.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.460
Let's add I Ingrid.

01:30.500 --> 01:37.310
So did we have full control over the positioning and our eye column where I will add a size size S M

01:37.340 --> 01:45.740
off six and offset s m of free for nice centering and less with on bigger devices and then the first

01:45.740 --> 01:48.620
column here I want to fetch the first name of a person.

01:48.620 --> 01:59.310
So add I an item here with an I label whereas say first name at the position off this label will be

01:59.550 --> 02:08.280
floating below that we have to buy an input with type of text and then since I will use the template

02:08.280 --> 02:15.450
driven approach energy model added a name added which you can be first dash name for example and I'll

02:15.450 --> 02:17.970
also add the required validator.

02:17.970 --> 02:24.540
Now I can also already wrap the entire grid with a formula because as I mentioned I will use the template

02:24.540 --> 02:29.400
driven approach and Dale four wheel needs that form tag for angular two detectives by the way for Dad

02:29.400 --> 02:36.030
it's always important that the module that declares create booking imports to form this module.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.040
Now back to this template here.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.820
This is the first row I want to add with the first name.

02:41.820 --> 02:50.430
Now it's not the only one all duplicate that to also get the last name here the name here all the input

02:50.430 --> 02:54.450
can be last name therefore type is still text of course.

02:54.450 --> 02:56.650
And then I want to have the number of guests.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.970
So let's render a number.

02:57.990 --> 03:02.160
Row here and the label could say number of guests.

03:02.160 --> 03:08.340
And then here I'll not use the I an input but a narrow component which we haven't seen yet ion select.

03:08.520 --> 03:14.810
Now you probably know the default h him out select which is the default HDL dropdown and I select works

03:14.850 --> 03:16.040
pretty much the same.

03:16.080 --> 03:21.420
It is a wrapper around the default H2 mount select element you could say and as always the official

03:21.420 --> 03:24.980
ionic docs are the place to go to learn all about this component.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.820
So I can select now gets a name which is guest number.

03:29.820 --> 03:33.980
And it also receives n g model here.

03:33.990 --> 03:42.270
However here I will bind and you model with square brackets to a default value of Q and this is important

03:42.270 --> 03:46.310
because I'll now add free options and I want to preselect option 2.

03:46.350 --> 03:51.510
We can change that but I want to start with that once elected so that there is always a selection for

03:51.510 --> 03:52.750
this.

03:52.800 --> 03:59.790
So let's now add a i n select option and such an option needs a value for me the values will be 1 2

03:59.790 --> 04:00.290
and 3.

04:00.420 --> 04:05.460
So here I'll start with value 1 and then what actually gets displayed on the screen is Andrew between

04:05.460 --> 04:08.190
the opening closing tag of I'll select option.

04:08.190 --> 04:10.010
So here it's 1.

04:10.190 --> 04:15.890
Now I'll also have 2 and 3 and also update the value here which is the data that is received behind

04:15.890 --> 04:17.090
the scenes.

04:17.090 --> 04:22.340
And we're good and now because I have value 2 here and I set D and entire select to a default value

04:22.340 --> 04:30.290
of 2 this option here will be preselected Now let's have a look at the dates because there will do more

04:30.320 --> 04:31.280
than we did before.
