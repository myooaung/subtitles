WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:07.170
So the application is taking shape and it's looking really nice in my opinion

00:07.280 --> 00:12.890
even though we haven't written a single line of CSS yet because of these beautiful default styles Ionic

00:12.920 --> 00:18.920
gives us and I hope you already get a feeling for how easy it is to compose a rich user interface with

00:18.920 --> 00:25.540
nice looking and as you will see, quite powerful and feature-rich components with little effort.

00:25.550 --> 00:31.120
I'm explaining a lot here but code-wise, we haven't written that much code and we only worked in HTML.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.600
So we got our card with the two items here,

00:35.680 --> 00:40.720
now I also want to have a button to submit my inputs here.

00:40.720 --> 00:46.960
We use the button before, we can add an ion-button element here and on that button, I want to have a text

00:46.990 --> 00:53.020
of add expense but I'll actually add two buttons, so I'll duplicate this because I also want to have

00:53.020 --> 00:54.680
a clear button here.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.580
Now if we save it just like this without any further configuration, then if we reload the app, we'll

01:00.580 --> 01:02.590
get two buttons that look like this,

01:02.770 --> 01:07.540
not ugly but maybe you also want to tweak this and have a different look.

01:07.600 --> 01:13.840
For example I want my clear button here to have a red color and this outlined look where it doesn't

01:13.840 --> 01:19.710
have a background color but only a border and a text color and I also want to have an icon in there,

01:19.840 --> 01:25.470
an icon that kind of signals that this cancels the input and clears the fields. And on the expense

01:25.470 --> 01:32.600
button, I want to have an icon too, a plus icon and I want to leave the style as it is otherwise.

01:32.770 --> 01:37.490
Now for this, let's start with the clear button,

01:37.680 --> 01:44.460
we can set the fill mode to outline. Alternative values can of course be found in the official docs

01:44.490 --> 01:50.760
as for all components, there if you explore the ion-button, you set that the fill mode can be set to

01:50.760 --> 01:57.060
clear to have neither a background nor a border, to outline to have just a border or to solid to have

01:57.060 --> 01:58.020
a background color.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.090
So here I'm going with outline

02:01.320 --> 02:05.070
and regarding the color, we got these nine default colors,

02:05.070 --> 02:11.160
primary, tertiary and so on, I can set this to danger here which is one of the default colors which will

02:11.160 --> 02:16.110
apply my default danger color which turns out by default to be red

02:16.110 --> 02:21.670
and of course you could change that but for now, let's go with the default and if we therefore reload

02:21.670 --> 02:23.620
this, we have this look now

02:23.670 --> 02:28.620
and please note that on an Android device up here, you need to reload if you switch to it for the first

02:28.620 --> 02:29.260
time,

02:29.430 --> 02:34.550
we actually also get this nice ripple effect, super.

02:34.590 --> 02:36.690
Now what about the icons?

02:36.690 --> 02:42.480
Now there is a built-in ion-icon component,

02:42.480 --> 02:43.770
here you go.

02:43.770 --> 02:49.830
Now actually this will redirect you to a brand new page because you could add this to any app as a separate

02:49.830 --> 02:55.760
package but the Ionic package we're importing from the CDN actually has it included already,

02:55.830 --> 02:57.570
so no need for an extra import,

02:57.570 --> 03:05.100
it's in here and we simply throw our icon into our button if we want to use it there or wherever you

03:05.100 --> 03:06.960
want to use it in your app.

03:07.170 --> 03:13.320
So I can add my ion-icon in here, just like this, right in front of the clear word.

03:13.320 --> 03:20.400
Now such an icon takes a name attribute and the name in turn can be found from this ionicons.com

03:20.400 --> 03:21.760
page.

03:21.810 --> 03:29.480
Now if you search for clear here, that doesn't look good but what about cancel or delete?

03:29.490 --> 03:31.530
Well, what about this cross?

03:31.710 --> 03:37.980
Now if we click on a cross here, you see the full markup down there and you see that name here is

03:37.980 --> 03:39.750
actually close,

03:39.750 --> 03:48.010
so let's go back and let's enter close here as an icon name. Now with that ion-icon added and the file saved,

03:48.080 --> 03:51.300
once you reload the page, you will see your icon here

03:51.300 --> 03:57.890
and this doesn't look too bad but you can even improve the look a little bit by clearly telling the

03:57.890 --> 04:03.650
icon where it should go into the button and you can do this with a concept called slots.

04:03.830 --> 04:10.400
Now slots are a default web component concept which basically allows web components to reserve certain

04:10.400 --> 04:18.180
places in their built-in markup where certain content should be rendered or can be targeted to be rendered

04:18.180 --> 04:23.310
and as always if there are slots, you can learn about them in the official docs.

04:23.360 --> 04:33.050
So here in the button docs here, you find examples for buttons with icons and different slots they target.

04:33.050 --> 04:40.960
So with that information here on our icon, you can add a slot of start for example

04:40.960 --> 04:47.930
and if you do that, if you add that slot start, you see the icon is now a little bit further

04:47.930 --> 04:51.280
on the left, we have more spacing between the icon and the text,

04:51.290 --> 04:53.810
it looks a bit cleaner now.

04:53.810 --> 04:57.920
Now feel free to add an icon to add expense on your own now.

04:57.920 --> 05:04.550
Find a fitting icon here on the ionicons page, it should be an icon that kind of signals that we

05:04.550 --> 05:08.180
can add something and then try adding it to that button.

05:08.210 --> 05:09.910
We'll of course also do it together

05:09.920 --> 05:13.440
but here is your chance to pause the video and try it on your own.

05:16.900 --> 05:17.960
Were you successful?

05:18.730 --> 05:21.580
Let's first of all find a fitting icon, shall we?

05:21.580 --> 05:24.820
So here on ionicons, if I search for add,

05:24.910 --> 05:26.510
what about this plus button?

05:26.530 --> 05:29.580
Of course if you use the different one, that's fine too.

05:29.590 --> 05:34.620
Now here we find the code for that and we can just copy that from down there

05:35.650 --> 05:46.040
and then go back to our source code and next to add expense, I will add my icon with the add button or with

05:46.160 --> 05:47.670
the add look.

05:47.710 --> 05:54.470
Now just as for the close button, I'll assign to my start slot to adjust the spacing and generally

05:54.470 --> 05:56.770
make sure that the button looks good.

05:56.840 --> 06:04.480
So with this added if we now reload, here is the plus button. So these are the buttons added,

06:04.490 --> 06:10.560
what about some spacing around the buttons and maybe we want to have them aligned to the right actually,

06:10.580 --> 06:11.810
how could this be achieved?
