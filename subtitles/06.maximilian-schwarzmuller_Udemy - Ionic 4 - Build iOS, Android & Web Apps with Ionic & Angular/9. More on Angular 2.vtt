00:00.360 --> 00:06.390
In class lectures we had a detailed look at angular and added features the core features which make

00:06.390 --> 00:07.220
up angular.

00:07.270 --> 00:09.480
There's a lot more to it.

00:09.690 --> 00:12.360
And again there's this no angular course.

00:12.450 --> 00:20.550
I hope that with this brief refresher you do remember those core Futurist again in indice ironic too.

00:20.550 --> 00:27.610
Course here we're going to have a look at a lot of other features or parts of angular too.

00:27.900 --> 00:35.350
And I will briefly explain them then again but again I really assume that you have this angular knowledge.

00:35.340 --> 00:42.480
This will really have the purpose of refreshing your knowledge that we should get to go and now to really

00:42.480 --> 00:48.900
dive into a sonic to and use and you'll are there to build awesome applications.
