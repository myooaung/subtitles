What the page is created Let's now look at this tap's navigation.

00:06.460 --> 00:12.580
For this I will actually go to the tap's HDMI files to the template of this tap's page get rid of all

00:12.580 --> 00:16.490
the content in there and instead add the iron tabs component.

00:16.540 --> 00:21.460
You probably recognize this from the first app we build where we also use tabs.

00:21.580 --> 00:27.120
We have two tabs an hour app the everywhere we'll add to tap tap.

00:27.130 --> 00:34.720
I should say components in this end taps Reppert component and the first tap should load my shopping

00:34.720 --> 00:35.650
list page.

00:35.710 --> 00:42.540
So here I will bind the root property to a property I have yet to create and is tap's component name

00:42.580 --> 00:45.660
the property as Al page for a shopping list page.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.720
I will store a reference to this page in this property then.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.840
And I also want to have the on this tab.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.370
Now you can look up those icons in the official documentation dear's I can repository I showed you in

00:57.370 --> 01:03.310
the first ep of fitting I can here actually is the list box Iott and in my opinion of course.

01:03.310 --> 01:08.540
Feel free to choose a different Ike and for this I also want to set up a title for this tab.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.600
You could of course also use.

01:10.600 --> 01:16.840
I can only add the title will be shopping list because well this is what these tab stores are where

01:16.840 --> 01:21.660
it leads to I should say all the bind property of the second tab.

01:21.820 --> 01:28.240
Here I want to point to the recipe's page property which I also have to create which will hold a reference

01:28.240 --> 01:35.290
to the recipe's page and there I want to set about Eicken of type book or with the name book which is

01:35.320 --> 01:35.780
as well.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.650
Nice book.

01:36.670 --> 01:40.150
I can which fits really well to a recipe book in my opinion.

01:40.390 --> 01:43.510
And then the tap title should be recipes.

01:43.660 --> 01:50.500
So if data two taps are set up now I need to add those properties I'm referencing in my template in

01:50.500 --> 01:52.470
the body of this component here.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.630
And the tab start TS file.

01:54.740 --> 01:59.440
I will also remove the unnecessary boilerplate which I don't need right now.

01:59.440 --> 02:05.410
So today I have a bare minimum component here and then I'll add the S L page property and this should

02:05.410 --> 02:08.290
store a reference to the shopping list page.

02:08.290 --> 02:13.830
So make sure to import a shopping list page from the appropriate folder in the pages folder.

02:14.130 --> 02:20.970
And also well make sure to assign it to s al page and the same for the recipes page which you guessed

02:20.970 --> 02:25.000
it should hold a reference to the recipes page because that's my second page.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.990
I want to be able to navigate to also make sure to add does import.

02:29.230 --> 02:38.080
Well and finally to really hook this all up and use those tabs page as our root page and our root navigation

02:38.080 --> 02:40.910
stack and we'll go to the app component.

02:41.050 --> 02:45.100
And here the root page is currently set to your home page.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.240
So I will switch just to tap's page home page of course doesn't exist anymore.

02:49.240 --> 02:55.630
So make sure to also remove the import to home page and also make sure to add the import to Tapps page.

02:55.630 --> 03:02.380
Since we're using this now well and with this we're setting we're assigning does tabs page to read page

03:02.380 --> 03:05.380
property which just bring this back into memory.

03:05.380 --> 03:12.070
We use in our app template and the template of the root component here when we set up our root navigation

03:12.070 --> 03:17.710
stack and we've said Tedward good to go on Stern is already running for me here.

03:17.770 --> 03:23.680
So if I save this we should now be able to go to the running application and reload this year and have

03:23.680 --> 03:30.220
two taps at the bottom shopping list recipes and it can indeed navigate between the two different pages.

03:30.220 --> 03:35.910
Now the theming is of course different 2D example application and there's no reason to change just a

03:35.910 --> 03:39.640
day and so we can adjust the theming on our own.

03:39.640 --> 03:46.510
Now what I will do is I will tell you the color code I actually used and with that it would be your

03:46.510 --> 03:49.900
task to make sure that you add just the global theming.

03:50.050 --> 03:55.240
So here you can see the colors I use in the finished application.

03:55.240 --> 04:00.760
You should be able to figure out where to use those color codes in order to change the general feeling

04:00.850 --> 04:02.970
of this app in the next lecture.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.300
We're going to change that theming together.
