00:02.060 --> 00:08.330
Inelastic try initialized my form array and I synchronized with h m l.

00:08.330 --> 00:12.650
Now I want to consider the case that we do have valid data.

00:12.650 --> 00:15.930
If we do have invalidate I want to show an error and then return.

00:15.980 --> 00:20.720
So that I don't continue and we will come back to this error message part later.

00:20.870 --> 00:26.810
Let's now add a new form form control to add such a new form control.

00:26.810 --> 00:33.510
I will need to edit or access my recipe form my ingredients control which is this array of controls.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.460
And there I need to push a new control.

00:36.610 --> 00:44.440
Now Engler or I should say typescript doesn't know that this is a form array.

00:44.530 --> 00:49.070
Therefore I will explicitly costed to inform typescript.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.150
Hey I know this part.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.180
You're referring to a form array because this is how to initialize it right.

00:56.270 --> 01:00.310
But since I use a string here it's not able to figure this out on its own.

01:00.350 --> 01:08.300
So with Formery between opening and closing tax here kind of I'm telling typescript that this is a form

01:08.300 --> 01:17.840
array and therefore it does now not complain if a use push on this to push a new form control of course

01:17.840 --> 01:25.370
because the array holds an array of form control some multiple form controls and this new form control

01:25.730 --> 01:36.140
now will extract the name from this data argument in passing here and name refers to this input is created

01:36.140 --> 01:36.720
here.

01:36.860 --> 01:43.940
So the name the user entered and this will be the default value for the subform control which I want

01:43.940 --> 01:45.190
to set up.

01:45.230 --> 01:53.120
Also I want to add the required validator here to make sure that this is not empty and or checks for

01:53.120 --> 01:55.650
it and push a new line so that it's easier to read.

01:55.880 --> 02:02.180
So if this does new control is created and added to the form array and it should then automatically

02:02.240 --> 02:07.160
all be displayed on our template on our page.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.450
Now in order to be able to view this I will leave Scollard as it is.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.490
We will finish it later and add some messages.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.500
I don't want it presented so I will return it.

02:18.500 --> 02:25.200
Remember here I did simply create it and store it in the new ingredient alert method X wasn't constant.

02:25.340 --> 02:31.820
I can now return does constant or simply don't store it at all and just return it like this.

02:31.820 --> 02:38.120
So now all this method does is it creates this alert and therefore now in the action sheet.

02:38.120 --> 02:46.640
Here when I click an ingredient I want to show this alert to what I do here is I will simply call this

02:47.090 --> 02:51.350
creating green alert which gives me that alert present.

02:51.470 --> 02:58.430
Since this gives me a readily configured alert now with this in place if we now save this and let it

02:58.430 --> 03:01.690
recompile Let's see if it works as intended.

03:01.700 --> 03:09.650
If we go to the new recipe page click on manager gradients Well we don't see the action sheet right.

03:09.980 --> 03:14.880
Well we don't see the actual sheet because we create it here we store it in this constant.

03:15.140 --> 03:18.970
But of course this won't show it in order to show it.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.120
You need to use this constant.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.330
You need to use these.

03:22.350 --> 03:28.510
Does this action sheet we are creating here like this and call present on this too.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.440
So with this in place now we're actually showing the actual sheet.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.940
And now up recompiling it should successfully show us that sheet.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.850
If we go to this new recipe page click here.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.010
Here you see it you can discarded.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.720
You can remove all ingredients which doesn't do anything as of now and you can click add ingredient

03:48.020 --> 03:55.740
which opens up this dialog where we can add milk and click ADD and it successfully adds this ingredient

03:55.740 --> 03:56.940
here as a control.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.990
Let's try this again with Brad at.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.760
Looks pretty good to me.

04:01.790 --> 04:04.130
So if we get this working.

04:04.130 --> 04:11.550
Now of course I also want to hook up d remove all ingredients button and show some messages when ingredient

04:11.560 --> 04:14.620
was added or was not added successfully.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.300
So let's work on this next
