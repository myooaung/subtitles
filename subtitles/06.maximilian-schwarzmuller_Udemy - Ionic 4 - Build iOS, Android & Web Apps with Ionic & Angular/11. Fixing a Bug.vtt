Now one thing I of course overlooked in the last lecture.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.450
I'm cleaning up my booking sub here which is great.

00:07.450 --> 00:10.280
Now I'm not storing it and enjoying it though.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.130
Make sure you do that of course.

00:12.130 --> 00:17.750
So here you want a store to subscription you're setting up shop to subscribe function or method here.

00:17.800 --> 00:22.930
You want to store it in the booking sub property which we do then use to clean up the subscription down

00:22.930 --> 00:23.600
there.
