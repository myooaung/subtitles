00:02.450 --> 00:06.930
So these were a couple of possible strategies when it comes to debugging,

00:07.040 --> 00:09.050
obviously just scratching the surface,

00:09.080 --> 00:14.960
you could create a whole course about debugging after all but very important lessons and very important

00:15.140 --> 00:16.540
things to keep in mind.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.560
You will encounter errors throughout this course and throughout

00:19.580 --> 00:26.720
any project you build and therefore reading the error messages, using console log, using breakpoints, inspecting

00:26.720 --> 00:32.210
the user interface, inspecting network requests and also having a look at memory and so on,

00:32.210 --> 00:37.070
these are core things you've got to be aware of and you should definitely look into when you're facing

00:37.070 --> 00:37.670
problems.
