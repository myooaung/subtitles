On the edit offer page here I'll again use the reactive forums approach and definitely feel free to

00:07.760 --> 00:08.870
take this as a challenge.

00:08.990 --> 00:16.060
We're already getting the data for this place so just make sure use it up reactive form that you create

00:16.060 --> 00:21.920
in your typescript file where users are then able to edit the title and description of the to offer

00:22.280 --> 00:26.450
nothing else because I don't want to introduce too much complexity here.

00:26.450 --> 00:31.860
Of course you could go more complex than that but I want to keep it relatively simple but at the H team

00:31.870 --> 00:33.230
l mark up for that.

00:33.230 --> 00:37.190
And at the Times good logic to initialize a forum with these two inputs.

00:37.190 --> 00:41.990
You don't need to worry about the actual updating logic and the service will implement this to gather

00:41.990 --> 00:43.760
in another module of this course.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.020
So for now it's just about gathering these inputs starting in the next lecture we'll do it together

00:48.110 --> 00:49.760
but definitely try on your own first.
