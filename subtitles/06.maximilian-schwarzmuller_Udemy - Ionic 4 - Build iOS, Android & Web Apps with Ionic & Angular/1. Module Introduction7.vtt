00:02.270 --> 00:09.770
Our application is nearing its completion but one thing is missing and that is user authentication.

00:09.770 --> 00:15.740
Thus far we have our user log in form but we're not doing anything with the input entered there.

00:15.740 --> 00:22.190
This will change in this module and I will show you how you could add authentication to an ionic app

00:22.600 --> 00:28.610
and for this you'll first of all learn how authentication works in ionic apps because there is a specific

00:28.610 --> 00:30.830
pattern you'll typically use.

00:30.830 --> 00:38.180
Then we'll add authentication to our application will add users sign up and log in and last but not

00:38.180 --> 00:44.270
least I will show you how to manage that authentication token which you'll get which is related to the

00:44.270 --> 00:47.600
first part where I explain how off indication works.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.640
So let's start with that part then.
