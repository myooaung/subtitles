00:02.300 --> 00:10.790
In this module we will dive into a specific category of ionic components and how we can use those components

00:10.850 --> 00:13.140
in an angular application.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.560
We'll have a look at fetching user input.

00:15.590 --> 00:20.790
So working with form inputs letting users enter data into our application.

00:20.870 --> 00:23.330
And with that I mean different kinds of data.

00:23.570 --> 00:28.310
Specifically in this module we'll dive into different ionic form controls.

00:28.310 --> 00:36.470
Normal text inputs date time selectors and more and I will also introduce you how to use these ionic

00:36.470 --> 00:45.320
form controls in the context of angular forms both using the template driven and reactive forms approach.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.690
Now one important note there.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.710
The template driven and reactive forms approach.

00:49.790 --> 00:56.180
These are terms or concepts stemming from angular not related to ionic.

00:56.180 --> 01:02.480
So if it's not 100 percent clear what I mean by that I will not explain that in depth in this module

01:02.660 --> 01:08.690
you should definitely consult my complete angular guide or at least the official angular docs to learn

01:08.690 --> 01:13.700
more about that in case it's not clear by the instructions given in this module.

01:13.700 --> 01:19.040
Now we'll not just have a look at getting the user input we'll also see how we can validated so how

01:19.040 --> 01:25.610
we can make sure that what the user enters actually matches the patterns or the expectations we have

01:25.880 --> 01:27.400
in our application.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.260
And with that let's dive in and let's build some forums.
