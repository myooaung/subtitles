WEBVTT

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.730
In the last lecture we worked on the Eichen and splash screen.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.740
Let's now have a look at the configuration we can set up and for this we have to go to the conflict

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.490
Exham file on the root directory dessous where we configure our application and where we configure the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.260
meta data for our application.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.750
So if we open this does might look very cryptic.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.720
Here we got a lot of entries and most of that is managed by onic to for us for example it edit all those

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.000
Eichen and splash entries here pointing to the eigen and splash assets.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.630
We created the last lecture.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.390
So it creates those entries when you run the ionic resource command.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.290
And if you do this for a number platform we add it it will add the Android entries here to you can of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.660
course also added those entries manually.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.030
But do it us with care because if you mess something up here it will probably not not look good on this

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.300
specific device I mention.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.980
So most of the settings here are fine and managed fruity Seelye or ironic too.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.750
Anyways.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.680
We mostly change things here at the top.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.460
This idea here for example is important.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.230
You can change it but you can also leave it like this.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.550
But it will be the idea you will later need when you publish and sign your application.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.130
The version is important.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.460
You can change this to any words number you want to display in the App Store.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.230
So 1.0 For example this is your internal version that doesn't influence anything else but it influences

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.190
what gets shown in the stores and of course you should increment this with each new release.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.210
Here we can also change the name of the app so let's name it or some places because this is what this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.310
app is about right.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.990
And it's not an awesome on a cord of the app.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.850
It's an awesome place ASAP.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.370
You can also change your offering credentials here and you should do so before releasing it and your

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.110
own web page here.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.270
And of course also the title of your or your name here.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.340
So here it would be Maximillian Schwartz Miller.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.230
Enter your name here enter your e-mail here and your web page here does all the what gets displayed

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.150
on the App Store.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.130
So make sure to get this right now.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.830
The rest here should probably nothing you want to worry about but you can get more information about

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.750
all the things you can configure here in any official Corda the documentation here under reference.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.370
You can find a detailed documentation on de-conflict SML file with all the different settings you can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.600
configure here what they do and which values you can or should provide.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.780
So definitely dive into this documentation to find tuya to your needs.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.000
The configuration we have here should be enough for many apps though.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.120
But again to really find you need for your app go into that documentation and also keep in mind that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.810
this Farleys also managed Freule ionic for example those icons which we added foody command but that

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.230
of course also does not mean that you can't override it manually.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.400
It just might get overwritten again if you run the Z like command again.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.720
With that we set up this configuration.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.180
Let's now push this app to our device again to see if the name change does is what we will be able to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.130
see right away.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.230
Before we dent in the next step finally dive into how we can get our application here to be built for

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.990
deployment and then actually deploy it.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.550
So this looks better of course the name is cut off so you might choose a shorter name but you'll see

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.060
that the name was changed.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.170
Well that is the only thing I can show you right now.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.570
Right.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.280
But you can see these are the settings having effect with that.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.340
It is configured.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.870
Now let's publish it to the App Store is in the next lecture is
