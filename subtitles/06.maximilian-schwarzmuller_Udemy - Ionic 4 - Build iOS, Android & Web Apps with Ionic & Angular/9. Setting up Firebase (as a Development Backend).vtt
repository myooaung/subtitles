00:01.990 --> 00:06.900
So as mentioned before I'm going to use firebase if you don't know what firebase is.

00:06.910 --> 00:10.920
It's a service by Google which basically gives you ready to use.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.750
Back and out of the box.

00:12.850 --> 00:18.910
You don't have to write any service code to now get a database you can use of indication features you

00:18.910 --> 00:21.390
can easily implement and much more.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.900
You can check the pricing to learn what it costs.

00:24.910 --> 00:30.550
It is free in its basic use search and it will be free for what we do with it.

00:30.610 --> 00:35.770
If you're going to use it in a real app you want to deploy and where you will have a lot of users.

00:35.770 --> 00:41.890
You will probably need one of the pait plans but again for testing it developing with it the free features

00:41.950 --> 00:43.310
are all we need.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.320
So definitely check out this.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.660
If you want to use it for a real project.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.820
Also check out the documentation here which is really great.

00:50.860 --> 00:53.190
And make sure to choose the Web documentation.

00:53.200 --> 00:58.840
Not Android or iOS because yes we're building an app for these devices but we're building it with a

00:58.840 --> 01:00.520
web framework with angular.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.480
Keep this in mind.

01:01.690 --> 01:07.780
And then finally the most important part is your console so you can open your console here which allows

01:07.780 --> 01:11.670
you to create new projects or access existing projects.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.460
Now I'm not going to use one of my existing projects.

01:14.470 --> 01:20.200
Instead I'm going to create a new one by clicking on create new project here and then you simply enter

01:20.200 --> 01:21.960
a project name.

01:21.970 --> 01:23.650
Now this can be any name you want.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.150
I'm going to name it ironic.

01:25.160 --> 01:31.390
Q recipe book like this because I already have the project with this name years.

01:31.390 --> 01:35.850
I'm going to omit the dasher and then choose your region.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.330
For me that is Germany and then it comes up we had to create project and this will set up a new project

01:41.350 --> 01:43.720
and a second we will see what this means.

01:43.720 --> 01:51.160
What a project our actually contains the project creation finished are now taking into my project dashboard.

01:51.160 --> 01:56.260
Here again you can easily get started by clicking at firebase to your web app but we won't do this for

01:56.260 --> 01:56.880
now.

01:57.010 --> 01:59.500
Here on the left you basically see the features you get.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.960
There are a lot of features but the most important ones are of authentication and database.

02:03.970 --> 02:05.860
You can also use default storage.

02:05.860 --> 02:09.630
We're not going to get into this now though because there's no firebase course.

02:09.640 --> 02:13.280
I really only use it as a dummy back and because it's easy to use.

02:13.570 --> 02:16.600
I'm interested in the authentication for now.

02:16.600 --> 02:23.080
Now we're also going to use the SDK firebase ships with for the authentication part and I would show

02:23.080 --> 02:26.100
you how to install this SDK in one of the next lectures.

02:26.110 --> 02:29.260
For now let's start by an ailing authentication here.

02:29.620 --> 02:33.950
You can go to often dictation and then you need to set up a sign in method.

02:34.150 --> 02:39.550
Now you can also use the third party authentication services like Facebook or Google.

02:39.610 --> 02:45.660
But here we're getting to choose email and password to add our own authentication feature or a service

02:45.670 --> 02:51.510
you could say simply click on it and then click on enable and save to turn this on.

02:51.670 --> 02:56.670
Now you are able to affect ticket users with their email and password in this project.

02:56.670 --> 03:02.140
Here again if you want to learn more about this definitely make sure to read the official documentation

03:02.170 --> 03:05.020
or take some dedicated firebase courses.

03:05.350 --> 03:11.050
Now with this edit it's time to add firebase to our project for days.

03:11.080 --> 03:17.860
Well first of all go back to the project to the command line to the terminal here and then I will install

03:17.860 --> 03:28.520
the firebase STK Frue NPM we can do it as by running NPM install dash dash save to also create an entry

03:28.520 --> 03:35.120
in the package that Chaisson and then just firebase this is the firebase package which we can then use

03:35.180 --> 03:40.760
to access certain features of firebase and for authentication we definitely need this because that makes

03:40.760 --> 03:42.010
it much easier.

03:42.050 --> 03:45.540
Now again I will use firebase of invocation.

03:45.560 --> 03:52.190
You can also of course use your own back and your own restful server you might have whatever you set

03:52.190 --> 03:53.790
up for this.

03:53.810 --> 03:56.320
Now the firebase STK got installed.

03:56.510 --> 03:59.250
The next step is to configure it in our app.

03:59.300 --> 04:05.630
For this you can click on a web set up here on the top right on the authentication tap your part and

04:05.630 --> 04:09.780
then basically you could copy this and put it into your index HDMI file.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.410
Though this is not how you should do it.

04:12.410 --> 04:17.120
Instead make sure to grab the API key and off domain.

04:17.150 --> 04:22.120
We're not going to use the feature so you don't need those links here.

04:22.130 --> 04:29.030
Make sure to use to grab those two lines here and then go back to your app to the app component here.

04:29.090 --> 04:32.910
We're going to initialize this firebase app in our constructor.

04:33.350 --> 04:36.910
We can simply do that by first importing firebase.

04:36.950 --> 04:44.320
I'm doing this here at the top import firebase from whip's from firebase.

04:44.590 --> 04:47.360
And of course this name here is totally up to you.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.800
You could also use justifier or F. B.

04:49.970 --> 04:56.130
I'm using firebase because well I do import firebase at the end and then in the constructor.

04:56.360 --> 05:02.530
Right at the beginning though you could also do it after this platform redcode you're right at the beginning

05:02.540 --> 05:06.380
in my case I'll add firebase Exeter's package we're importing.

05:06.530 --> 05:10.850
And then initialize AB which is kind of obvious what it does.

05:10.850 --> 05:17.060
I guess initialises your application with firebase and then you need to peer pass a javascript object

05:17.060 --> 05:18.910
with two configuration options.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.770
Now this javascript object is the same object you see here.

05:22.940 --> 05:28.010
So you could pass the full object but again we're not needing the database we're going to access it

05:28.010 --> 05:28.910
differently.

05:28.970 --> 05:32.430
We don't need to storage and we don't send any messages.

05:32.450 --> 05:39.020
So here I will simply paste in the two lines I copied from before our API Ickey the off domain and make

05:39.020 --> 05:41.960
sure to use your own key and off domain here of course.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.600
And with that the firebase app is initialized we can now use it.

05:45.610 --> 05:50.450
We can now use the features firebase offers us and it's important to do this right at the beginning

05:50.450 --> 05:50.950
of the app.

05:50.950 --> 05:56.100
Therefore in the constructor of the app component because we're using firebase for our application.

05:56.150 --> 06:01.940
So initializing it on the tap's component would be too late because we already need some features before

06:01.940 --> 06:03.790
we reach that component right.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.690
So with this firebase is set up an initialized.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.510
Again if you want to learn more about firebase have a look at the official docs.

06:10.550 --> 06:14.700
Have a look at the pricing if you want to use it for your bigger projects.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.840
I'm interested in setting up authentication and will start doing this in the next lecture.
