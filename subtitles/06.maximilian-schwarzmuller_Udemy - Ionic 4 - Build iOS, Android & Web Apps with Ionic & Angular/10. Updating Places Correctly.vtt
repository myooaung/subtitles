00:02.340 --> 00:04.530
What if we now try to edit this.

00:04.530 --> 00:09.180
If I remove key exclamation marks and I reloaded the app whilst I was on this page.

00:09.240 --> 00:15.420
So I have not visited offers and discover the now tried to save as I get an error.

00:15.420 --> 00:22.800
And the reason for that error simply is that on the places service we have our update play some effort

00:23.220 --> 00:26.870
and there we get that data which we just entered on the form.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.380
But then we try to update a place in our array of places.

00:30.450 --> 00:37.260
Now obviously dad might not exist though we're fetching our array of places here but initially that

00:37.260 --> 00:38.210
is empty right.

00:38.220 --> 00:43.620
We initialize the behavior subject with an empty place and does only changes if fetch places is called.

00:43.620 --> 00:48.510
So if we do fetch places from our back end but we never did this here.

00:48.510 --> 00:50.910
So how can we work around this then.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.360
Well in the end here in switch map where I try to get my places we can add a if check and we can see

00:57.360 --> 01:05.940
if not places or if places length is smaller or equaled in 0 which means we don't have any places yet.

01:06.090 --> 01:12.200
And in this case the observable I want to return here is this fetch places to fetch my places with the

01:12.210 --> 01:21.690
help of the fetch places method remember the fetch places method here in the end will go ahead and fetch

01:21.720 --> 01:27.720
all places and it will then also update our places in the subscription but more important than that

01:28.050 --> 01:33.870
it will also give us the places in the subscribe method we haven't used that thus far because we only

01:33.870 --> 01:35.850
need at the update in the subscription.

01:35.850 --> 01:41.190
Now down here we're not interested in subscription update because we don't set up an ongoing subscription

01:41.250 --> 01:44.640
we only take one snapshot and that would be the empty list here.

01:44.670 --> 01:50.790
If there are no places initially but the good thing is fetch places still returns us it is updated array

01:50.790 --> 01:57.330
of places so we can use that here too and the subscription will be changed or the global list of places

01:57.330 --> 02:01.560
new behavior subject will be changed along the way in the background as well.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.200
By the logic we have in fetch places.

02:04.350 --> 02:07.040
So here I returned this fetch places.

02:07.050 --> 02:09.120
If we have no places yet.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.770
Otherwise so in the Ellis case I just return places.

02:13.770 --> 02:18.550
But this would now be invalid because you actually need to return observable here and for this hour

02:18.550 --> 02:26.630
extra as has the nice off observable creation operator which you import up there from our extra yes.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.410
So not from our exchange as operators but just from our exchanges.

02:30.690 --> 02:37.320
And what of does is it takes any value like an array or a number doesn't matter and it wraps it into

02:37.320 --> 02:43.650
a new observable that will immediately emit a value and does is only required here so that in both cases

02:43.710 --> 02:49.590
we definitely return an observable because switch map you need to return one and now you can take all

02:49.590 --> 02:50.550
that logic here

02:53.490 --> 02:57.920
and cut that and add another switch map

03:00.990 --> 03:05.240
operator a year where you now get your places list again.

03:05.250 --> 03:09.550
And now here you can add all the logic you had in the old switch map operator.

03:09.570 --> 03:17.010
The difference here simply is that now places is guaranteed to be an array here because either we had

03:17.010 --> 03:22.170
one right from the start then this of course was a bit of a redundant step but it also doesn't hurt

03:22.680 --> 03:24.110
or we had no places.

03:24.120 --> 03:30.180
Well then this was a super important step because then we fetched places and now with that we make sure

03:30.180 --> 03:35.850
that when we update our places we should always have a list of places which we can update.

03:35.880 --> 03:41.300
So if I now added this and removed the exclamation marks and I save this now it is looks way better

03:41.430 --> 03:47.370
even though I never visited any other page before but our updating logic now works because we ensure

03:47.370 --> 03:49.670
that we always have a list of places to work with.
