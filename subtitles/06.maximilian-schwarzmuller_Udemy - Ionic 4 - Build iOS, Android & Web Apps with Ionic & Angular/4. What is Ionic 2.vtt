00:02.030 --> 00:07.290
Let's get started diving into this course sponsoring the most important question first what is I want

00:07.280 --> 00:08.050
to go to.

00:08.390 --> 00:12.850
Well the goal with ironic too is to create apps for Android or Windows.

00:12.980 --> 00:18.980
And I'm speaking of native apps so apps running on those devices installed on those devices.

00:18.980 --> 00:25.580
Now chances are you don't know swift Objective C and Java and Android framework and C-Sharp you don't

00:25.580 --> 00:30.250
know all those languages you would need to know to develop apps for all those platforms.

00:30.380 --> 00:35.780
You might know one or the Arab led from it maybe you don't even know that but you do know javascript

00:35.800 --> 00:41.570
H.J. of L and C S S because you probably do know how to develop web apps now would be nice if you could

00:41.570 --> 00:49.130
kind of take that knowledge take those web apps and transform them into native apps for iOS Android

00:49.190 --> 00:51.050
and Windows.

00:51.080 --> 00:57.120
Now it turns out there is a helpful tool a framework which does just that and it is not ironic to its

00:57.140 --> 01:00.200
Apache Cordoba framework by Apache.

01:00.200 --> 01:06.750
And what does Fromberg does is it compiles javascript H.M.S. as s so web apps into Iowa.

01:06.770 --> 01:08.600
Android or Windows apps.

01:08.750 --> 01:13.950
Now of course those apps have to follow a certain structure and be set up in a certain way.

01:14.060 --> 01:20.730
But if that is the case a patch Cordoba is able to easily create those native apps for you.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.780
Now where does ionic to come into play though.

01:23.780 --> 01:26.730
Because this course is not about a party Cordoba.

01:27.050 --> 01:33.320
Well chances are you don't want to create your web app with vanilla javascript team LNC as us but you

01:33.320 --> 01:39.920
do know angular specifically angry to hear which is a great framework allowing you to create re-active

01:39.920 --> 01:41.720
web applications.

01:41.720 --> 01:48.770
Now we already have a way of compiling Angey words you code you could say so types could code into javascript.

01:48.830 --> 01:52.580
T Molinsky is Escoto of creating such web applications.

01:52.580 --> 02:00.260
Still ironic too is introduced as an extra step between angular to and the web app of our iOS Android

02:00.260 --> 02:01.880
Windows part here.

02:01.910 --> 02:08.270
What I want it to does is it gives you zem tooling which allows you to create projects following that

02:08.270 --> 02:08.900
structure.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.030
Apache quarter of needs.

02:10.040 --> 02:16.160
In the end it will also compile your angular typescript code into a native word into a vanilla Chalis

02:16.150 --> 02:17.810
could H.T. Melchior's as project.

02:17.810 --> 02:23.740
Following that structure cordovan needs and it also gives you a rich component library with beautifully

02:23.740 --> 02:31.400
styled components you will need for your mobile apps so like for example to a nice modals alerts slider's

02:31.460 --> 02:37.210
tabs and so on and a lot of convenience tools help Braam efforts and much more.

02:37.460 --> 02:41.260
So this is what I object to is a package toolset.

02:41.300 --> 02:46.610
A command line interface in the end which we will install which allows you to easily create pre-configured

02:46.610 --> 02:52.640
projects a workflow which will compile your Anglo code and which will also then trigger does Apache

02:52.640 --> 02:57.340
coord of a compilation so that you never have to work with Apache code of it directly.

02:57.650 --> 03:04.220
And is a rich library of convenience tools and these components you can use and that is all we need

03:04.220 --> 03:08.610
to know about it for now we will see all those things in action soon.
