00:02.380 --> 00:04.920
Now that's it for the grid. As I mentioned,

00:04.920 --> 00:08.050
check out the official docs for all features,

00:08.080 --> 00:13.870
one thing that I want to show you is that on ion-grid, you can also add fixed. If you don't add it, by

00:13.870 --> 00:17.640
default the grid takes the full width of the screen, with fixed,

00:17.650 --> 00:25.180
it actually also takes breakpoints into account to use a fixed width, a pixel fixed width instead of the

00:25.180 --> 00:27.870
full width which you see on bigger screens

00:27.880 --> 00:40.770
if you now actually add a new ion-column let's say in the second row here, row 2 col 1 and we

00:40.770 --> 00:41.920
repeat that.

00:41.940 --> 00:48.540
Now what you will see for that second row which should take the full available width, there is more

00:48.690 --> 00:51.800
space to the right and that's not the default padding

00:51.810 --> 00:58.650
and it becomes wider because now the overall grid has a fixed width across which it will not grow

00:58.950 --> 01:04.400
and this can be helpful if you have a page where at some point, you don't want to take the full available

01:04.400 --> 01:04.960
width,

01:05.040 --> 01:10.770
let's say this page is viewed on a TV, then maybe you still want to have a certain area for the grid

01:10.890 --> 01:14.010
and not take 100% of the available width.

01:14.130 --> 01:19.510
Now that is only the case if you added fixed as an attribute to ion-grid,

01:19.590 --> 01:26.700
if you don't add this, then the grid will always span 100% of the page width. But that's it for

01:26.700 --> 01:27.660
the grid,

01:27.660 --> 01:33.830
as I mentioned check the official docs to learn all about it and see more examples and what you'll also

01:33.840 --> 01:40.350
learn there and what we'll dive into in the styling and theming module is that you can also overwrite

01:40.410 --> 01:46.920
these breakpoints with CSS and CSS variables, a feature I will dive into in the styling and theming

01:46.920 --> 01:47.700
section.

01:47.730 --> 01:53.130
So here you can already learn more about that, that you can overwrite certain settings for the grid in

01:53.130 --> 01:55.710
case you want to adjust it to your requirements,

01:55.710 --> 02:01.380
otherwise you learned how to work with the defaults and still set up your own layout with the help

02:01.380 --> 02:09.750
of the size and the offset attributes and these responsive attributes with sm, md, lg and so on.
