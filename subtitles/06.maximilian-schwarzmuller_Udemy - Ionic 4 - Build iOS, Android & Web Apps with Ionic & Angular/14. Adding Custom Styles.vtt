00:02.230 --> 00:04.760
Quote card already looks pretty decent.

00:04.790 --> 00:05.710
I like it.

00:05.810 --> 00:13.520
However what I want to change is the way this offer looks like I want to make it all uppercase let's

00:13.520 --> 00:20.690
say and position on the right and maybe all to change the text color a bit and to do this I'll write

00:20.690 --> 00:21.900
my own style.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.870
We don't have to stick to built in ionic two components and helper directives.

00:26.870 --> 00:29.600
We can always restyle things on our own.

00:29.600 --> 00:34.330
So I'm going to the quotes s.c.s as file as I explained at the end of the last lecture.

00:34.340 --> 00:37.600
This is how you can set up your own styles.

00:37.970 --> 00:44.420
And there I will create my own class which should only apply to the page or to the quotes page to Everetts

00:44.420 --> 00:47.000
nested inside the page called selector.

00:47.390 --> 00:55.020
Here a name at all for an accepted Kelk color to this gray ish color here.

00:55.190 --> 01:03.220
I want to align the text to the right as I said it would be nice to have it transformed to uppercase

01:03.230 --> 01:07.270
does this all normal C S S code here as a side note.

01:09.550 --> 01:13.820
I want to remove any margins and any padding I might have.

01:14.170 --> 01:21.580
And I recognize that there is a typo so transform is the correct name and here of course.

01:21.580 --> 01:24.470
And I also want to have a leading dash.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.490
Now we could do this like this all for.

01:27.490 --> 01:30.550
And then the before pseudos selector.

01:30.970 --> 01:36.510
And that would allow us to say content Dasch like this.

01:36.760 --> 01:44.140
But since we're using s.c.s s and therefore SAS we can use a shortcut which is to use T and sign and

01:44.140 --> 01:49.790
then the pseudos selector and this will basically the end with when it gets compiled to see us as create

01:49.790 --> 01:51.110
dissent next year.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.430
And simply place our set up in there our style.

01:56.430 --> 01:59.930
So it just saved us the extra offer word.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.310
And it's more a c s s s s s s ss more SAS ish.

02:04.350 --> 02:08.190
But of course you can use the normal C S style if you prefer this.

02:08.490 --> 02:14.190
So with this if we have a look at it didn't change right because we're not using the all for class of

02:14.190 --> 02:14.680
course.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.630
So let's go back to the quotes.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.830
Let's go back to this paragraph which outputs our all for name and there I'm going to add the all for

02:22.830 --> 02:29.120
class just like this normal default boring aged female code with that.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.200
Let's go back to here once again.

02:31.320 --> 02:38.280
And this looks much more the way I wanted to look with the leading dash and this light rays look so

02:38.340 --> 02:43.330
that it does not overly The quote content.

02:43.500 --> 02:48.870
Instead this really makes it easy to see the offer but focus on the quote.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.330
I like the look of that card of course.

02:51.330 --> 02:54.410
Feel free to play around with that style to your needs.

02:54.510 --> 03:02.130
Maybe dive into the cart's documentation here to pick another feature which you really want to have

03:02.130 --> 03:03.280
in your card.

03:03.480 --> 03:09.680
Also keep in mind of course that we will come back to elements or two components later in the reps too.

03:09.750 --> 03:14.160
But if you want to play around with it right now go ahead do it now.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.620
I'm going to continue with this app though and I want to work on this favorite button so that we're

03:19.620 --> 03:21.770
actually able to favorite.
