Adding a log at functionality is super simple with firebase I go to the off service because here I have

00:08.300 --> 00:14.900
all my off indication related methods someplace and I'll add a log out method to dis service doesn't

00:14.900 --> 00:22.820
take any arguments and it will simply call firebase off and then we have a sign out method so sign out

00:23.090 --> 00:25.070
will simply lock the user out.

00:25.130 --> 00:30.610
And what this will do behind the scenes is it will delete our token our token.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.740
I'll come back to this in a second.

00:32.750 --> 00:38.410
Now with this in place let's look at this log out button in the app component which is where we have

00:38.450 --> 00:41.150
days on log out method.

00:41.540 --> 00:47.560
And here I will simply reach out to the off service which I need to inject for this of course I haven't

00:47.560 --> 00:48.120
done this.

00:48.140 --> 00:51.180
Let's quickly add this to the constructor here.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.180
Let's inject the.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.370
Of service like this.

00:57.370 --> 01:03.050
Make sure to also add the import of course and with that object that I can reach out to be of service

01:03.230 --> 01:07.370
and call log out to lock the user out if you click on logout button.

01:07.490 --> 01:12.020
And of course I also want to close the menu once I did this.

01:12.020 --> 01:16.880
So let's do this let's recompile the code and let's see if this works.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.710
And you'll notice that there is an error on the right.

01:19.730 --> 01:23.040
And if I try to go to recipe's the app actually breaks.

01:23.060 --> 01:27.180
So something is wrong something is not working as it should now.

01:27.260 --> 01:29.740
And this can be very tricky to spot.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.650
Do you have an idea what might be wrong.

01:31.670 --> 01:34.840
It really is hard to find.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.670
Let's have a look at our code.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.010
It is probably related to a setting or route page here.

01:40.050 --> 01:40.290
Right.

01:40.290 --> 01:43.560
Because something is broken with our page.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.690
We get this error right away and we can't navigate to our abjured tap.

01:47.790 --> 01:55.280
The issue we do have is when we watched the offstage changed event here and we do have to use reset.

01:55.290 --> 02:03.930
So we are often dictated we call this nafs said root and Neph grabs the nav controller from our template.

02:03.930 --> 02:10.350
The problem is we're doing this here now constructor and even though on all changed firers the event

02:10.380 --> 02:14.830
asynchronously and Nadra right after the constructor was called.

02:14.910 --> 02:20.490
It's pretty fast firebase doesn't take that long to find out if our user is offended by it.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.810
And that results in an issue.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.500
Our template hasn't been initialized.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.430
Therefore our navigation stack hasn't been initialized.

02:28.590 --> 02:35.520
Therefore viewed shild will actually not have grabbed our navigation control or from the template.

02:35.520 --> 02:43.320
So this nafs said Drouet will actually not set the route of our navigation stack because it's not initialized

02:43.320 --> 02:46.110
correctly to fix this.

02:46.110 --> 02:48.100
I'm going to do something else here.

02:48.390 --> 02:53.750
I'm going to change the taps page property here back to route page.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.320
You'll see why in a second.

02:55.410 --> 03:01.290
And I also add it does any type assignment which is important that this is of type any.

03:01.350 --> 03:07.140
Now I'm going to go to the template and here set the root property of the Ayia Napa element back to

03:07.140 --> 03:10.740
route page because that is what I change the property name to.

03:10.950 --> 03:16.170
And I'm also going to change this year on the onload method for 40 recipe book.

03:16.290 --> 03:22.910
I'm passing route page year because initially Deadwood will hold my tap's page now.

03:22.980 --> 03:31.710
However I will dynamically reassign the page here so I will set this route page here equal to tap's

03:31.710 --> 03:32.000
page.

03:32.010 --> 03:37.970
If we are offended Kheta it and I will set it to the sign in page.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.800
If we are not now.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.820
This does not do the same as set route.

03:42.900 --> 03:48.590
It will not necessarily navigate us there but it will set it to this page.

03:48.590 --> 03:56.070
Behind the scenes and this will run for the first time before we actually initialized our navigation

03:56.130 --> 04:01.560
Stec it will make sure that our navigation deck gets initialized with the right page.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.240
Now I'll come back to how we can then navigate around later.

04:05.250 --> 04:11.320
So with this let's save this change and let our app reload.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.950
Now you see the error is gone and I'm able to go back to recipe's if I click on log out though.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.100
You'll notice I stay on the shopping list.

04:19.140 --> 04:24.210
If I open the menu again and close it without selecting something you see I'm now on a sign in page

04:24.210 --> 04:28.950
so it needed this extra change to texture run to give us the right page.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.080
So this is not working as intended.

04:31.260 --> 04:36.100
I will come back to this in a second though before coming back to this.

04:36.240 --> 04:41.160
Let's first understand how firebase did determine that we are authentic hated in the first place
