Let's remove a couple of columns and let's say we only have two left

00:06.620 --> 00:10.950
and that would be a more common use case, that we want to have two items sit next to each other.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.670
Now as I reload here, we see two columns here on the small screen and on the big screen, where they of

00:16.670 --> 00:20.100
course take up way more space. Now

00:20.120 --> 00:27.140
a common scenario would be that you don't want to take up that much space here on a screen, so you

00:27.140 --> 00:31.580
can control that with the size attribute on every column.

00:31.580 --> 00:36.030
You could say after 12 columns you could possibly take,

00:36.260 --> 00:46.450
you should take let's say 10 and the second item here should take 1, that would be a possible split.

00:46.450 --> 00:51.460
Now we have one column unassigned but that's okay, we'll just have an empty space at the end here,

00:51.460 --> 00:51.900
right,

00:51.910 --> 00:53.140
like this.

00:53.140 --> 00:56.220
So this already shows you how you can think about that.

00:56.230 --> 01:01.260
It's not that you don't have to split the available space equally, here

01:01.270 --> 01:03.190
I'm certainly not doing that,

01:03.190 --> 01:08.290
instead you have 12 columns you can play with and you can distribute that space however you want

01:08.440 --> 01:11.440
and you don't have to assign all 12 columns

01:11.440 --> 01:15.280
and indeed, that's not what we did on the discover page either.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.500
If we have a look at our discover page

01:20.140 --> 01:21.000
here,

01:21.060 --> 01:27.420
you see that I'm basically only assigning 8 columns here of the 12 available and I'll come

01:27.420 --> 01:30.870
back to what this sm thing means and how it works in details

01:30.870 --> 01:38.910
soon. You could of course also say that you want to have four columns each and therefore, we have four

01:38.910 --> 01:40.980
columns left over

01:40.980 --> 01:47.610
and now we see four and four, that looks about equal and then we have an equally sized space left over.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.960
Now what about centering though? That is where this offset thing comes into play.

01:53.010 --> 01:55.910
You can not just assign the size of a column,

01:56.010 --> 02:01.110
you can also tell the Ionic grid how much is should be offset from the left.

02:01.620 --> 02:09.120
So here, you could say offset 4 for example and what this means is this column will be pushed to the

02:09.120 --> 02:17.370
right by four columns and then it will have a width of four columns. This column then automatically comes

02:17.520 --> 02:18.220
after,

02:18.240 --> 02:24.290
so on the right of the first column because it comes after the first column here in the order of HTML

02:24.290 --> 02:31.560
code and therefore this starts four columns in is four columns wide, this therefore starts eight

02:31.560 --> 02:36.580
columns in, four plus four and then is also four columns wide

02:36.750 --> 02:41.970
and this gives us the layout where we will have that empty space on the left and our columns take up

02:41.970 --> 02:43.950
the space on the right.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.510
Now if you want to center it,

02:45.510 --> 02:48.930
the solution of course is to just push this in two columns

02:48.930 --> 02:53.820
so that we have an equally open space to the left and to the right of two columns each

02:53.820 --> 02:59.630
because we pushed the first column in by two columns, then this has a width of four columns, therefore

02:59.630 --> 03:09.250
the second column starts six columns in, two, two plus four and then takes four columns of width.

03:09.260 --> 03:16.610
So of the 12 columns, we have two plus four plus four makes ten columns occupied, two columns are empty,

03:16.880 --> 03:22.400
eight columns do contain content and the other two columns on the right are left empty and that gives

03:22.400 --> 03:24.200
us this centered layout,

03:24.200 --> 03:29.930
this is essentially also what we're using on the discover page. Now that already gives you an idea of

03:29.960 --> 03:31.270
how you can play around with that

03:31.520 --> 03:37.160
and of course, you can do the same when using six columns or eight columns. You can really play around with

03:37.160 --> 03:42.110
sizes and offsets to control how the items are rendered on the screen.
