In the last lecture I created the HMO code for a template.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.700
It won't work though because we're not loading a recipe.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.970
This property doesn't exist yet.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.450
But before I actually load it let be styled this day of year just to kind of all the practice is s.c.s

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.300
thing again or does custom styling.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.300
I want to add a class here which all names subtitle of course you can choose any name you like.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.240
And then the is as file of the recipe component.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.560
I will simply add this class or a set up this class here and it will be super simple but I want to have

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.350
Mei's subtitle to be uppercase I can achieve this with text transform and I will set the color Tudor's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.170
light gray look here.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.280
So really just you again see this in action so that you don't forget about this file and that you can

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.630
change the styling of your template with that file if you wrap it inside of this outer selector.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.950
So what this the HDMI Ellas prepared.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.950
And D C S S is prepared.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.260
Restyling.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.160
Now let's actually load our recipe Fetchit.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.000
We're getting it from neth Perens in the end.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.290
And then make sure that we can see Cedar's before we start hooking up those buttons thereafter.
