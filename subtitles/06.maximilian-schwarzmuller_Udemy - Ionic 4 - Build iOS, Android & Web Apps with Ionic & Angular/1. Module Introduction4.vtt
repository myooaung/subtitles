00:02.280 --> 00:08.240
Let's dive into that persistent state part which I mentioned in the last module as well.

00:08.250 --> 00:14.520
And with that I simply mean let's make sure that we also save data on a back end on a server running

00:14.520 --> 00:17.250
in the web not on our local device.

00:17.250 --> 00:22.290
And of course that we don't just save data there but that we can all to fetch it from there.

00:22.290 --> 00:29.130
So in this module we'll have a brief look at how we actually connect an eye on a gap tube back and how

00:29.130 --> 00:35.640
that works technically or how we implement that and then we'll simply build stuff will work on the app

00:35.640 --> 00:41.280
and we'll make sure that we store all the places we create on the back end that we fetch to places from

00:41.280 --> 00:44.100
there and that we all just where our bookings stair.
