00:01.980 --> 00:05.570
In the last lectures we made a huge progress.

00:05.610 --> 00:11.250
We're now having a working recipe page here where we can click new recipe and we actually submit our

00:11.250 --> 00:17.420
own form but we don't do anything with the form and that has a reason it's not complete.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.940
Our form isn't finished.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.780
We don't have any new ingredients for our recipe but certainly a recipe without ingredients is not that

00:24.780 --> 00:25.610
useful.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.140
So let's work on this now.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.830
Let's see how you could approach this.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.900
It all starts in the template.

00:32.910 --> 00:35.670
And he added recipe template here.

00:35.730 --> 00:43.680
I want to output my ingredients and once you put them dynamically I will do this below this iron list

00:43.680 --> 00:44.320
here.

00:44.520 --> 00:51.480
I will start by adding a button where I say manage ingredients because actually by clicking this button

00:52.050 --> 00:58.800
I want to open up this action see each sheet you saw and Demo these menus sliding up from the bottom

00:58.950 --> 01:07.830
which allows you to well dynamically ever add a new ingredient or delete all existing ingredients.

01:08.100 --> 01:13.700
Therefore this pattern will be of tight buttons so that it doesn't submit the form when you click it.

01:13.710 --> 01:19.040
I also want to apply this clear style to have no background and no border and very important.

01:19.050 --> 01:22.080
We need to add the on button directive to make it look nice.

01:22.080 --> 01:27.840
Also make it of type block so that it's nicely centered spanning across the full width.

01:28.110 --> 01:34.730
So this is my button here and this button is nice to have that doesn't do anything as of now.

01:34.920 --> 01:43.680
So let's add a click listener here and execute on manage ingredients method and put this up over multiple

01:43.680 --> 01:48.120
lines so that again it's a bit easier to read and to understand.

01:48.180 --> 01:49.910
This method doesn't exist yet.

01:49.980 --> 01:56.430
We're going to add it soon before adding it or add another and list below the button where I actually

01:56.430 --> 01:59.980
don't want to store the ingredients we added.

02:00.030 --> 02:05.560
Notice that we're still inside the form and that's important because it will be part of this for.

02:05.850 --> 02:13.220
In this iron list I want to have iron items and I will use N-G for to replicate this where each line

02:13.220 --> 02:23.000
item is input with I on label which should say name the name of the ingredient and ion input.

02:23.010 --> 02:29.770
You could also add multiple items to the list to have each ingredient also have a mount.

02:29.970 --> 02:37.800
Or you could use a grid or something to position to next to each other name an amount whatever you like.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.290
I'll stick to the name so simply for simplicity reasons.

02:41.370 --> 02:45.770
I'll assume that each ingredient is only needed once to keep this a bit simpler.

02:45.960 --> 02:52.320
So there's just a name and the input of the course should then store this name or city should allow

02:52.320 --> 02:59.490
the user to enter this name so it will be of type text and I'll come back to the rest of this configuration

02:59.490 --> 03:02.660
and how to synchronize it with our form later.

03:02.770 --> 03:09.870
Does the template part for our ingredients part of this form it's not finished but it's all we can do

03:09.870 --> 03:11.130
for now.

03:11.130 --> 03:13.680
The next step leads to the typescript file.

03:13.740 --> 03:21.600
Well we need to kind of dynamically create our ingredients and the first step is to hook up does manage

03:21.600 --> 03:26.190
ingredients button to present us with a choice of what we actually want to do.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.440
Let's start working on this in the next lecture.
