00:02.330 --> 00:07.880
So this authentication form is of course managed in the off page and there thus far.

00:07.880 --> 00:12.680
I have my eye list with my email in there my email input.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.050
I will actually keep that e-mail input there but that is of course not all at once.

00:17.060 --> 00:24.200
I also want a second eye an item and remember you should wrap your labels and inputs in items to get

00:24.200 --> 00:28.160
some extra styling and behavior like that floating label.

00:28.220 --> 00:33.540
It will also be important for validation and correctly showing when there is an error in the input.

00:33.920 --> 00:41.240
So definitely use an item here and then I'll add another item label where I say password and dad label

00:41.240 --> 00:50.330
should also have a position of floating below that we can use or we can add our ion input which should

00:50.330 --> 00:52.550
be of type password.

00:52.610 --> 00:54.380
Now the first 1000 have a type.

00:54.380 --> 00:57.980
We could set one to text but that is the default anyways.

00:58.190 --> 01:02.870
So now we have a password input and we have a text input that is pretty nice.

01:02.900 --> 01:08.630
Now I also want an extra button that allows me to toggle between sign up and sign in mode.

01:08.660 --> 01:17.220
So between logging in and signing up and they offer I'll add another button here where I say switch

01:17.220 --> 01:18.900
to log in.

01:18.900 --> 01:24.090
Though we will set this text dynamically student because of course that should say switch to sign up

01:24.120 --> 01:29.360
if we're in log in mode already and they're all use color of primary.

01:29.430 --> 01:34.560
But I'll set the fill mode to clear which basically make sure that we only have to text and nothing

01:34.560 --> 01:35.160
else.

01:36.380 --> 01:45.110
Now if we save that and we let this page reload this is when we get not too bad but also not entirely

01:45.110 --> 01:46.110
what I want.

01:46.160 --> 01:53.560
I also want the buttons to be beneath each other and not sit next to job rest a do here.

01:53.570 --> 01:56.220
And of course there are various ways of achieving that.

01:56.270 --> 01:59.680
We can simply wrap then into divs for example.

01:59.750 --> 02:07.310
You could also manually styled them via C as s and turn them to block buttons or here we can actually

02:07.310 --> 02:13.790
take advantage of another attribute ionic allows us to set on an on button and that's the X bond attribute

02:14.000 --> 02:22.940
and you can set this to block or two full now if you set this to full this takes the entire line and

02:22.940 --> 02:25.790
the difference between block and fall becomes pretty clear.

02:25.790 --> 02:32.820
Once I do the same on the other button if I set this to full.

02:32.910 --> 02:34.430
You see now it looks like this.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.060
And if I set this to block

02:42.250 --> 02:44.340
it looks to say right.

02:44.380 --> 02:49.600
Not entirely one difference you'll note is the corners with block with rounded corners here.

02:49.660 --> 02:56.830
As you can see if I switches back to full you will see we have no rounded corners no the rounded corners

02:56.830 --> 03:03.220
are not the only difference it becomes clearer if I go to my second button here and a gift is a fill

03:03.280 --> 03:10.390
of not clear but of outline to make sure that this is a button without a background color but with a

03:10.390 --> 03:16.060
border and you seem for full there is no left to right border because the idea behind full is that it

03:16.060 --> 03:18.640
takes the full width of the container.

03:18.640 --> 03:22.990
Now here we just happened to have some padding set on our content which is why this button doesn't take

03:22.990 --> 03:29.110
the full page width but if you would have this in some other container that does take the full page

03:29.110 --> 03:34.920
width then with X pond full you take that full width with X pond block on the other end.

03:34.930 --> 03:40.420
You also take that full width but you leave a little bit of spacing on the left or right and you keep

03:40.510 --> 03:42.120
your left or right borders.

03:42.220 --> 03:47.050
So this just as a button it takes the full width but looks like a normal button otherwise full is a

03:47.050 --> 03:53.590
special button that takes the full width and is also styled to be a seamless button going from left

03:53.590 --> 03:59.930
to right without clear borders you could say no I'll remove fill outline here but I'll keep X blob on

03:59.940 --> 04:05.110
block here and I'll also set X bond block on the first button and therefore we now have two buttons

04:05.110 --> 04:11.980
that simply take the full entire width off their parent container and therefore they are now positioned

04:11.980 --> 04:13.480
beneath each other.

04:13.540 --> 04:21.730
Now I also will wrap that in a grid here so I'll add iron grid and with iron Ro and iron coal because

04:21.730 --> 04:32.230
I want to control my sizes and I'll set a size on a medium sized or bigger screens of 6 and I'll Offset

04:32.280 --> 04:42.830
helps offset MDL Frieda forward to center this and in that column I'll add this list here and then I'll

04:42.830 --> 04:47.790
add another row below that with another column with the same rules.

04:47.870 --> 04:53.230
So therefore we can of course just copy them if you want like that.

04:53.450 --> 04:59.080
And in this column I'll have my two buttons here like that.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.750
And now with that we should have the same look here on the mobile device.

05:02.750 --> 05:09.980
That shouldn't change but on bigger screens as I expand this this doesn't take the full screen size

05:10.340 --> 05:14.240
and maybe we can even start at small screens.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.470
Now to think about this.

05:15.470 --> 05:22.700
So let me change this to sizes M and offset S M on both iron columns here so that we actually already

05:22.700 --> 05:29.720
take less width on well smaller screens like this one because they are I think it's old enough if it's

05:29.780 --> 05:31.270
centered in the middle.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.870
Yeah that should be OK.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.490
And on mobile devices it still looks the way it did.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.750
So these are the visuals.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.590
That is how our 4 looks like now it's time to also make sure it works like a form.
