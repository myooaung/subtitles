00:02.440 --> 00:07.870
Let's now create some custom see as a style and I'll do that on that offers page where I'm not super

00:07.870 --> 00:10.330
happy with the styles currently have there.

00:10.360 --> 00:15.580
Now of course you can also change that with the default tools on it gives you for example on the Discover

00:15.580 --> 00:15.910
page.

00:15.910 --> 00:21.880
We also have a nice looking list with just the default ionic features of using age to tag and a paragraph

00:21.880 --> 00:28.450
tag giving us this list which looks really nice in my opinion but I want to have a different style here

00:28.450 --> 00:33.970
and I also want to show you how to write your own C as S or SAS rules and how they fit into the big

00:33.970 --> 00:35.100
picture.

00:35.230 --> 00:41.100
So therefore let's have a look at our offers page here.

00:41.110 --> 00:42.240
Here it is.

00:42.250 --> 00:47.900
And there we have these items where I currently only have that label with the h1 tag.

00:48.670 --> 00:54.580
I will now generate a new component which simply holds the content that will be rendered instead of

00:54.610 --> 00:55.600
an item.

00:55.600 --> 01:02.170
So basically this part here where I will then use custom see as rules to adjust the styling.

01:02.170 --> 01:04.960
Now you can of course create that component manually.

01:05.050 --> 01:12.100
All use ionic generate component here and I want to generate that component in my places folder then

01:12.160 --> 01:21.020
under offers and then offer a dash item course you can name two component whoever you want I'll grab

01:21.020 --> 01:23.630
that thumbnail and that I label content.

01:23.630 --> 01:30.580
So basically what I had in my eye an item here were actually let's grab the entire item and in the offer

01:30.670 --> 01:33.690
item I'll place that in here.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.800
Now of course we'll need to get that offer as I input to this component.

01:37.900 --> 01:45.170
So let's quickly add at input here offer which for now is off type place actually.

01:45.180 --> 01:48.950
And therefore you should import your place small up there as well.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.050
Now we can access things like the image you are El again.

01:52.050 --> 01:53.990
So this should now work.

01:54.060 --> 02:01.800
And I want to focus on the styling now for this I will have my age one tag here inside of that label

02:01.800 --> 02:02.700
let's say.

02:02.700 --> 02:08.970
But below that I'll add a death and in the div I want to have a from to date.

02:08.970 --> 02:15.270
So basically for which timespan am I offering this place for that I'll add I and I can here with a name

02:15.270 --> 02:22.470
of calendar R next to that all use I in text gift us a color primary.

02:22.470 --> 02:28.080
So actually not my own custom C is s style here but does I add text element which is great if we just

02:28.080 --> 02:30.040
want to give some texture color.

02:30.060 --> 02:35.650
And here I'll put I did Amick value and for now we don't have any dates for our places or offers.

02:35.790 --> 02:43.320
So you know just call a function get dummy date which will replace later and I'll use to date pipe angular

02:43.410 --> 02:49.170
it gives some by default which trance forms this to look nice and get dummy data is simply a functional

02:49.170 --> 02:58.730
add here where a return new date so which is simply the current timestamp So with that I got this and

02:58.910 --> 03:11.400
I will also then add a span with the word two and then repeat that half that calendar I can again and

03:11.400 --> 03:17.190
get a no dummy date which will technically be the same as the first one because it's still today but

03:17.190 --> 03:19.950
again we'll replace this with better data later.

03:19.950 --> 03:30.580
Now let's say used as offer item here so in my eye an item a sliding commode of your all add app offer

03:30.580 --> 03:36.280
item and I'll pass in my offer which here is the offer and looping fruit.

03:36.280 --> 03:41.500
So this offer here on the right side of the equal sign refers to does offer a variable offer here in

03:41.500 --> 03:48.130
the square brackets refers to my offer property in there and of course also make sure that your offer

03:48.160 --> 03:56.700
item component is declared here next to the offers page in my case so with that if we save this let's

03:56.700 --> 04:03.680
have a look at our application log in and go to the offers.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.080
And this is how it looks like now.

04:05.090 --> 04:08.670
It's not the finished style obviously but it's getting there.

04:08.760 --> 04:15.950
Now there are things I want to fix and that is where a custom CSX code will come into play.

04:15.980 --> 04:21.710
First of all I have that div where I have all that information about the starting date and ending date

04:22.090 --> 04:28.360
the gift is a class of offer details and of course you can use any name you want.

04:28.400 --> 04:35.060
Now all select offer details here with a class selector and set this to use the Flex box specification

04:35.120 --> 04:40.790
by using display flex the devil dentist and the items are laid out in a row.

04:40.790 --> 04:47.600
And I want to align items vertically and centered and there which you can do with a line items center

04:48.810 --> 04:54.330
and I'll quickly go to the off service to set is authenticated to true again.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.650
So did Wendy page reloads.

04:55.650 --> 05:01.630
We actually go back to the offer page immediately and we don't have to wait for that log in animation.

05:01.710 --> 05:05.390
So let's now have a look at what this gives us.

05:05.400 --> 05:12.360
Asked is reloads I need to log in one more time but thereafter we should be done and now it this at

05:12.360 --> 05:13.840
least vertically centered.

05:13.890 --> 05:20.040
Now obviously there is no spacing between the different items and to achieve spacing we could of course

05:20.040 --> 05:27.590
use justified content space between here but a larger displaced this will probably not look that good.

05:27.600 --> 05:33.030
So instead this is all something which I can achieve here in my 80 mile code if we want to have some

05:33.030 --> 05:41.010
spacing around the items we can add some padding Haras sawn tall because I want to have spacing to the

05:41.010 --> 05:49.260
left or right or margin horizontal here to iron text also 2 to

05:52.090 --> 05:54.360
introduce iron texture.

05:54.400 --> 06:01.510
Let's see what that gives us here I'm using these CEOs as utility attributes and that looks better but

06:01.510 --> 06:03.490
it's of course way too much.

06:03.550 --> 06:05.790
So this is not really what I want.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.720
So let's reverse this.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.930
And again it's something we're accustomed see as s stalls can save us.

06:12.070 --> 06:19.870
I simply want to style all my items here and offer details instead I could add a space left class lecture

06:19.870 --> 06:26.350
here and give that a margin to left off let's say five pixels.

06:26.350 --> 06:31.780
Now space left as a class we can now assign in here for example to design and text here.

06:32.060 --> 06:35.510
Space left and to all the other items there as well.

06:35.530 --> 06:41.770
So to here to the calendar I can here and to this text and obviously there would be other ways of achieving

06:41.770 --> 06:47.820
the same look but I want to show how to write custom C as s code and this looks now nicer.

06:47.890 --> 06:51.570
Now I also want to color the icon here and for that we can.

06:51.580 --> 06:58.120
Again we could use custom CEOs as the rules but I can't again I'll just use the color attribute which

06:58.260 --> 07:07.110
I and I can does support and there for example set this to secondary so let's do that for both icons

07:07.350 --> 07:12.080
here and now if we save that we'll have a nice day.

07:12.220 --> 07:15.820
We'll have a nicely colored icon using our secondary color.

07:16.270 --> 07:22.810
And I think the tertiary color is a bit better here by the way but that of course depends on which colors

07:22.810 --> 07:24.010
you chose for your theme.

07:25.730 --> 07:31.370
Last but not least I want to style that H1 tag here and I think we can actually make this look better

07:31.760 --> 07:39.690
if we use primary here whoops primary here on the icon and on eye and text here where I previously used

07:39.690 --> 07:44.180
primary I use tertiary which in my case here is that darker purple.

07:44.190 --> 07:48.970
Obviously it depends on the color as you chose which style you want to implement here.

07:49.000 --> 07:49.230
Yeah.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.120
So I'm happy with that style.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.120
Obviously you can't play around with that choose a different style.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.210
Now what about that H1 tag though.

07:56.250 --> 08:02.120
Here again I want to write a custom CSX rule so it might see us as or my SAS file here I'll select the

08:02.120 --> 08:07.440
age one element and by the way angular scopes these styles to this component.

08:07.500 --> 08:13.680
So this age one's elector will only select age 1 elements in this component here and nowhere else and

08:13.740 --> 08:22.020
will they ever select this age one element and I'll reduce the font size here to let's say 18 pixels

08:23.050 --> 08:29.740
and gift as a border of one pixel solid and then all consumer global sea is as variable which is a way

08:29.740 --> 08:36.260
lable here because in variables we did define them in the route selector which means they're defined

08:36.260 --> 08:41.870
on the topmost element which is the H Tim l element and thanks to see as inheritance we can then use

08:41.870 --> 08:46.610
them anywhere even in this component and in this age one tag somewhere in our component.

08:46.700 --> 08:57.320
So here I will use my ion color primary variable again and I'll add some pattern here of let's say eight

08:57.620 --> 08:59.030
pixels.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.700
Now I'll save this and see what this gives me

09:06.830 --> 09:08.970
and that is going in the right direction.

09:09.210 --> 09:17.640
All now all add a border radius of five pixels and set a text color which also is using that primary

09:17.640 --> 09:18.740
CSA as variables.

09:18.750 --> 09:27.820
I'll just copy that code from up here and with that we should have a nicely styled offer item here Yep.

09:27.870 --> 09:33.400
Doesn't look too bad now obviously adjusts to your requirements or to your preferences.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.690
I'm happy with this.

09:34.760 --> 09:40.890
And the most important thing is this shows how you can set your own C as a stars and how they fit in

09:40.890 --> 09:46.320
the big picture how you can use global C as as variables in there and how you can also combine them

09:46.560 --> 09:52.650
with things like the color attributes to then still use some default behaviors of building components

09:53.010 --> 09:54.810
and obviously you can still swipe them and so on.

09:54.810 --> 09:58.980
So this is not touched by the fact that we're using our own C as s styles here.
