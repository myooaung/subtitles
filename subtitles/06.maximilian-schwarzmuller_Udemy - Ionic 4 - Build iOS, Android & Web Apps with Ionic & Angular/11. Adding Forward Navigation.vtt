00:02.650 --> 00:07.570
Seeing the places is nice but we only added them so that we could dive deeper into navigation and have

00:07.570 --> 00:14.710
a way of going to the details of such a place and eventually opening that booking modal and to achieve

00:14.740 --> 00:21.190
this, we need to make sure we can tab these places or we add some kind of book this place button. It's up

00:21.190 --> 00:22.890
to you what you want to do,

00:22.990 --> 00:30.540
I want to make these items here tappable, these ion items and here for my favorite place, for my featured

00:30.550 --> 00:37.150
place, I want to add a button that actually allows us to go to the details.

00:37.690 --> 00:41.830
Let's start with the button on the featured place, here

00:41.860 --> 00:50.080
after ion card content but still in the ion card, so before the closing tag of ion card, I'll add

00:50.080 --> 00:51.570
a new div,

00:51.790 --> 00:56.160
simple normal div with text right

00:56.160 --> 01:01.820
so that all the text is moved all the way to the right and with some padding and then in here, I'll add

01:01.820 --> 01:07.620
an ion button and that ion button will get a fill mode of clear which means it has no background and

01:07.620 --> 01:09.180
no border.

01:09.180 --> 01:18.170
I'll give it a color of primary and I want to add a router link here to go to a certain page.

01:18.210 --> 01:24.270
Now that router link will be bound dynamically because I will need to pass the ID of that place.

01:24.270 --> 01:31.620
So here, we pass multiple route segments between square brackets and here, I'll construct this in a very

01:31.620 --> 01:34.760
long way to make it really clear what our individual segments are,

01:34.770 --> 01:39.950
you could merge them all into one string here actually if you wanted to but I'll start with a slash

01:39.960 --> 01:45.540
to have an absolute navigation because relative navigation is a bit buggy at the moment still,

01:45.540 --> 01:50.990
then places, then tabs and I'm simply moving through all my route config, right?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.640
So I have, in the app routing module, we have places,

01:54.720 --> 02:00.510
that's our first segment and therefore here we start with an absolute, with a slash for an absolute

02:00.510 --> 02:01.240
navigation,

02:01.260 --> 02:04.460
then we go into places, that will take us if

02:04.560 --> 02:11.580
we have a look, to the places page module, so the places module loads the places-routing file and there

02:11.580 --> 02:13.700
we have that tabs route we want to go into

02:13.980 --> 02:16.000
and then we want to go into discover

02:16.140 --> 02:23.760
and then here into place ID and that is of course a dynamic segment then. So back in the discover page,

02:24.060 --> 02:34.260
we go to places, tabs, then discover and then that dynamic segment is my place here, my loaded places,

02:34.350 --> 02:41.980
the first element and then the ID. Well let's close that button tag and restructure this across multiple

02:41.980 --> 02:48.680
lines to make it easier to read and inside of this button, I'll simply have a text of more

02:48.730 --> 02:50.950
and of course you can have any text you want.

02:52.400 --> 02:57.900
Now if you save that, we should have a nice button here,

02:57.950 --> 02:58.830
there it is

02:58.880 --> 03:03.620
and if we tab it, we are indeed taken to the place detail page with no back button right now

03:03.620 --> 03:06.020
but of course we can use the browser back button. Here

03:06.020 --> 03:13.660
however we don't get that nice transition, that's important to note because we leverage a browser feature

03:13.660 --> 03:17.910
here which is not captured by Javascript or handled in any way.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.960
So that's nice and that works

03:24.760 --> 03:28.060
and actually I think we could even do without the padding on that

03:28.070 --> 03:30.740
div here around the button, might look nicer,

03:33.210 --> 03:39.830
it definitely does in my opinion but you can style this however you want or we'll actually center this and therefore

03:39.890 --> 03:45.190
since we already center all the text in the card, I just remove text right now to think about this

03:46.110 --> 03:49.330
but that are minor things and you can adjust this to your liking.

03:49.360 --> 03:54.730
One thing you can set when you set router link which I haven't showed you before is you can also set

03:54.730 --> 03:55.990
router direction.

03:55.990 --> 03:59.880
Now that is Ionic specific, not Angular, not an Angular feature

04:00.190 --> 04:06.610
and this will give Ionic a hint whether this navigation here will be a forward navigation and therefore

04:06.610 --> 04:12.580
it should play an animation that actually adds a page to the stack and looks like you're going forward

04:13.150 --> 04:20.560
or if it should play a backward animation. So you can set this here to forward or to backward or you

04:20.560 --> 04:25.450
just give it away and Ionic will detect it automatically which typically works quite nice

04:25.600 --> 04:31.240
but setting this router direction can be helpful when this is a page that might be loaded as the first

04:31.240 --> 04:35.800
page of your application where this should actually go back instead of forward

04:35.860 --> 04:42.670
and then by setting this to backward manually, would apply the right animation and not play the default

04:42.670 --> 04:49.540
of forward which Ionic probably which detect if the page is loaded for the first time. We don't need

04:49.540 --> 04:55.360
it here though, that's our button. Now for the list down there,

04:55.360 --> 05:01.420
I want to navigate when we tab one of the list items, that is actually super simple to implement, on ion

05:01.430 --> 05:02.170
item,

05:02.170 --> 05:08.410
you can simply add router link and of course, you could always also add a click listener and execute

05:08.410 --> 05:13.240
a method in which you then route programmatically with the injected Angular router

05:13.240 --> 05:15.760
but here, I'll use router link. Again

05:15.800 --> 05:19.090
this also needs to be bound to a dynamic value

05:19.090 --> 05:30.140
and this will be an array where we go to //places tabs discover and then also the dynamic

05:30.140 --> 05:36.380
segment here is place because we're going through all the places and we store each place in a place variable

05:36.920 --> 05:39.370
and then it's just place ID

05:39.890 --> 05:42.790
and now we have that router link on the ion item.

05:43.010 --> 05:50.890
If we now let this reload, we can tab these items and the navigation works but it's not super clear that

05:50.890 --> 05:57.280
we can tab them and therefore Ionic gives us a little convenience feature. On an ion item, you can add a special

05:57.280 --> 06:03.070
detail attribute, you don't need to pass in any value, you just add it like this and this will render a

06:03.070 --> 06:09.010
little icon, a little arrow icon that indicates that this moves you forward, here

06:09.040 --> 06:13.990
this little arrow on the right and this makes it clearer that we can press this.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.920
So that is the basic forward backward navigation implemented,

06:17.950 --> 06:18.490
let's move on.
