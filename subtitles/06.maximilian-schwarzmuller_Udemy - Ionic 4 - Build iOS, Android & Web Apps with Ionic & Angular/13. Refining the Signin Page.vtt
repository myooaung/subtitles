00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.290
Too refined a sign in page a bit more and basically going to do the same.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.350
As for the sign up page here I'm injecting my loading controller here because this is what I'll need

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.620
to display does this loader make sure to imported from ionic angular.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.740
And I'm also going to inject the alert controller to present any potential errors in an alert.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.510
Make sure to also at this import at the top also from ionic angular we'll end with this emplace.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.780
I could copy the code from the on Sign-Up method but to practice practices again let's simply create

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.410
a new loading controller or a new loading view here I should say Rudel loading controller with to create

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.440
Meffert.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.650
Let's set our content off.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.240
Now in this case signing you in because that's what we do here right signing you in.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.790
And let's then pre-sent does loading view now in the success case here.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.850
I simply want to dismiss this.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.050
Again we'll work on this later to then also navigate user to a different page.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.390
And then the Eric case I of course also want to dismiss it but I also want to show an alert.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.250
So let's quickly initialises alert here to this alert controller create and again by passing a javascript

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.080
object setting a tidal sign in failed would be a fitting tile in my opinion and then setting a message

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.910
which we can retrieve from this aero object returned by firebase.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.660
Last but not least ongoing to add this OK button.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.350
And then of course we have to present the controller.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.930
Now let's see this in action.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.100
It shouldn't hold any big surprises though.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.650
It should really work.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.430
Kind of the same as on the sign up page but just to make sure that we didn't introduce some bug let's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:11.290
add the correct data first like this so seems to work we don't get a console message anymore since they

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.590
removed us but we also don't get an error.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.990
Let's now enter wrong data.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.100
Now we get the silent failed error.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.840
So with this we get our sign up and sign in components set up.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.870
We get those pages working.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.830
Now the next step is to somehow manage our authentication stage to kind of determine if we are authentic

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.120
hated or not.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.040
And then of course we also need to split up our app into separate pieces
