00:02.160 --> 00:04.270
So enough of the theory,

00:04.470 --> 00:12.540
let's go back to our course project and there we created a simple project in module one where I used

00:13.170 --> 00:17.280
Angular with Ionic to create this project.

00:17.280 --> 00:25.770
What I'll do now is I will actually delete all the content here, we'll later recreate such a project and

00:25.770 --> 00:28.680
I will start without Angular,

00:28.680 --> 00:35.490
I'll just add an index.html file and here in VS Code which is the editor I'm using, I can create

00:35.880 --> 00:43.050
a new HTML5 skeleton by typing HTML and then simply hitting control space and then selecting

00:43.080 --> 00:51.550
HTML5 and we get this skeleton here. Now as a first simple dummy app here, I want to build a budget

00:51.550 --> 00:58.060
planner, basically a list that allows us to add expenses and calculate our total expenses,

00:58.060 --> 01:04.690
so a very simple app which will still allow us to already use quite a bit of these Ionic components.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.810
Now why am I using this without Angular?

01:07.810 --> 01:14.040
Because whilst we will use Angular for the rest of the course, one of the biggest strengths of these

01:14.040 --> 01:19.180
Ionic web components is that they work without any framework as well

01:19.180 --> 01:24.160
and I want you to understand this and I want to focus solely on Ionic here

01:24.220 --> 01:30.130
so that you don't even have a chance of thinking that this could be Angular's thing or that Angular could

01:30.130 --> 01:33.750
be doing something here because we're not using Angular in this simple app

01:33.850 --> 01:37.340
but no worries, for the rest of the course we will use it.

01:37.360 --> 01:42.370
So here I want to use just Ionic and we can do that. For this,

01:42.370 --> 01:48.210
you should visit ionicframework.com and there, developer's UI components,

01:48.430 --> 01:53.760
click on guide here and then simply choose packages and CDN. 

01:54.280 --> 02:01.060
Now here you learned how you can add Ionic to an Angular app but you'll also find this CDN link

02:01.060 --> 02:09.880
here which you can add into any HTML file to include the Ionic package to it and with the Ionic

02:09.880 --> 02:10.330
package,

02:10.330 --> 02:17.680
I mean this package of pre-built Ionic web components. You should add it here at the end of your head

02:17.800 --> 02:20.890
section and you can leave it just like this

02:20.890 --> 02:25.240
and actually what's not mentioned here, at least not when I'm recording this,

02:25.240 --> 02:27.130
you don't just need the Javascript package,

02:27.130 --> 02:33.880
you also want some default styles. For this, you can simply duplicate this import but change it to a link

02:34.570 --> 02:42.580
which has a rel attribute of stylesheet and where you then set the ref attribute and you

02:42.580 --> 02:51.040
should point at the same link but then replace this here with CSS and instead of ionic.js, you

02:51.040 --> 02:57.580
need to have ionic.bundle.css. Now we have both the styles and Javascript code and we're

02:57.580 --> 03:02.680
now ready to go and ready to start using Ionic's components.
