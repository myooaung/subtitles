To control general things like margin around elements or padding inside of elements or positioning

00:08.750 --> 00:11.410
inside of a container, of a box,

00:11.720 --> 00:17.900
you can use a utility feature provided by Ionic or some utility features to be precise,

00:17.900 --> 00:23.990
a couple of utility CSS classes or attributes you can add to elements to have some default

00:23.990 --> 00:25.310
CSS kick in.

00:25.550 --> 00:31.850
You'll find it in the official guide, there under layout by clicking on CSS utilities.

00:32.120 --> 00:38.840
Now here you find a bunch of examples and these are all attributes you just add onto an element to automatically

00:38.840 --> 00:41.410
apply some CSS styling to it,

00:41.510 --> 00:45.190
that's a feature made available by Ionic out of the box and

00:45.230 --> 00:49.130
this allows us to for example add a simple div,

00:49.220 --> 00:52.230
yes we can use normal HTML elements there too,

00:52.220 --> 00:59.330
you're not restricted to using Ionic elements only. So I add a normal div here around my buttons and

00:59.420 --> 01:05.900
what we can do there is we can add a margin to add a margin in all directions or just margin vertical

01:06.240 --> 01:14.050
and you can find all of that in this utilities documentation here. So margin vertical to add a margin

01:14.050 --> 01:21.310
to top and bottom and then to position the buttons on the right, you can add text right here for example.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.660
With that simple trick,

01:23.680 --> 01:30.340
still no line of CSS written from our side, we can add such a default look and this looks quite nice

01:30.340 --> 01:31.440
in my opinion.

01:31.570 --> 01:38.950
Now please note that this also has the advantage of always adding the same default margin.

01:38.950 --> 01:45.100
So this means that you don't have to worry about assigning a margin that is too slim and therefore doesn't

01:45.100 --> 01:49.090
fit into the general look of the rest of the page or anything like this,

01:49.150 --> 01:55.960
you can of course overwrite the default margin Ionic assumes and sets but thereafter, whenever you throw

01:56.200 --> 02:01.180
margin vertical or margin or anything like this onto an element, you will use this default

02:01.180 --> 02:09.010
look, this default margin and that helps you keep a general look, a standardized look in your application.
