WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:05.970
We also have a couple of other core elements which you use a lot

00:06.010 --> 00:12.100
and for this, I'm back on the discover page where we already got a couple of them. In our ion-list

00:12.110 --> 00:17.720
specifically, we have an ion-item and I mentioned that this is the structure you should have. In a

00:17.720 --> 00:18.340
list,

00:18.380 --> 00:24.150
you should basically only have ion-items as direct children, inside of the ion-items,

00:24.170 --> 00:26.660
you can then have any content you want.

00:26.660 --> 00:32.120
Now here I also have that use case where the ion-list is inside of an ion-column which of course is

00:32.120 --> 00:37.840
part of an ion-grid simply because that allows me to control the width of this list here.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.470
This is actually still quite wide on bigger screens as you can tell and

00:41.510 --> 00:47.480
we could shrink this down more but it still does not take 100% of the page width which it would

00:47.480 --> 00:49.390
do otherwise.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.620
Now inside of the ion-item, we then got an ion-thumbnail and I'll come back to images and different

00:54.620 --> 00:57.900
ways of loading images in Ionic later in this module,

00:57.920 --> 01:04.070
for now I want to focus on the ion-label and ion-label is actually a component you'll also use quite

01:04.070 --> 01:13.640
a bit in Ionic. You use it typically inside of ion-items to wrap any text related content, not only just

01:13.640 --> 01:14.330
text,

01:14.330 --> 01:20.150
so if I would type something like this here but also text wrapped into other elements and there it's

01:20.150 --> 01:27.530
just a good practice to use an ion-label and it will also optimize some stylings. The ion-label will

01:27.650 --> 01:34.790
also become very important later once we add an input and once we add form elements and I already want

01:34.790 --> 01:39.200
to show you what I mean on the auth page here, there

01:39.230 --> 01:47.900
if I add an ion-item and that is also worth pointing out, whilst you typically use the ion-item inside of a list

01:47.900 --> 01:55.070
and that is indeed also recommended or where you will mostly see it, you can actually also use an ion-item

01:55.160 --> 01:56.260
outside of a list.

01:56.300 --> 02:03.620
So inside of an ion-list, you should have ion-items as direct children and ion-item could be also placed outside

02:03.620 --> 02:04.360
of a list though,

02:04.370 --> 02:11.090
so this way around it works. Now in inside of the ion-item, a pattern you'll see a lot later is that you

02:11.090 --> 02:17.780
add an ion-label where you can add a position attribute which you can set to floating.

02:17.780 --> 02:25.370
There also are other values and I'll dive into those once we go into the input section, the form input section,

02:25.550 --> 02:31.610
you can of course also dive into the Ionic docs to learn all configurations for the position attribute.

02:31.730 --> 02:38.300
Now what I actually want to show is that if you now add an ion-input or one of the other form control

02:38.360 --> 02:46.940
Ionic components, you actually get a nice label, let's say for the email that will float up as soon as

02:46.940 --> 02:48.190
you click on the input.

02:48.860 --> 02:54.880
So let's wait for the app to reload and let's logout to go to the auth screen and here's our email item,

02:55.010 --> 02:58.190
way too big of course, way too wide but still

02:58.340 --> 03:00.580
and it floats up when I click in there.

03:00.620 --> 03:05.460
Now this style is added also because of ion-item.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.000
If I comment out ion-item here,

03:08.000 --> 03:15.790
so I just have ion-label and ion-input and the rest is the same though, as this page reloads here,

03:16.030 --> 03:17.530
you see this looks different,

03:17.530 --> 03:24.580
we can't really see that there is an input because it has no bottom line and the email is also not

03:24.580 --> 03:25.660
floating up.

03:25.950 --> 03:31.720
So the ion-item also plays an important role, in conjunction with the ion-label and the ion-input

03:32.230 --> 03:35.100
as a wrapper for ion-label and ion-input.

03:35.170 --> 03:41.150
So ion-item used inside of an ion-list but can be used outside of it there too

03:41.170 --> 03:47.230
and then you mostly see it being used with ion-label and ion-input, though by the way, that's also worth

03:47.230 --> 03:47.950
mentioning,

03:48.130 --> 03:51.490
if we would have an ion-list around this, it would also work.

03:51.490 --> 03:56.710
So just because you're holding an input in a label does not mean that the ion-item must not be in a

03:56.710 --> 03:57.450
list,

03:57.490 --> 03:58.900
it absolutely can

03:58.900 --> 04:03.780
and if you're building a longer form, it would be recommended to wrap a list around this,

04:03.880 --> 04:06.140
so you don't really see a difference here though.

04:06.340 --> 04:12.690
But the label is special in the sense of that with that position and inside of an ion-item and an ion-input,

04:12.700 --> 04:19.630
it all of a sudden behaves very specialized and has this extra feature combined with the input

04:19.870 --> 04:27.790
but you can also use it without an input here to just wrap different text and the ion-item on the other

04:27.790 --> 04:35.590
hand can be a nice container inside of an ion-list for any content you want but in conjunction with

04:35.670 --> 04:43.150
form inputs and ion-label, it also has this special behavior of giving you this nice input look with the

04:43.150 --> 04:47.340
underline here and of that floating label if you wanted.

04:47.590 --> 04:55.500
So ion-item and ion-label are very special and very versatile in these scenarios I showed you here

04:55.510 --> 04:56.710
though,

04:56.860 --> 05:02.980
these are really the main use cases for ion-item and how you configure it and how you use it in conjunction

05:02.980 --> 05:09.580
with ion-label and ion-input or in conjunction with ion-list and for the ion-label, it's basically

05:09.580 --> 05:10.360
the same.

05:10.360 --> 05:17.350
It has this special behavior when combined with ion-input or similar form controls and ion-item,

05:17.410 --> 05:22.540
if you don't have that conjunction, so if you have no related input and you're not setting the position

05:22.540 --> 05:28.870
prop, then it just act as a wrapper around text or text elements. And I'm just really emphasizing this

05:29.080 --> 05:36.430
because to me, it initially has been confusing when I use an ion-item, when I use a label and why these

05:36.430 --> 05:43.330
components exist but they're basically all about getting good styling and nice effects in different

05:43.330 --> 05:44.800
contexts.

05:44.800 --> 05:51.430
So to summarize, an ion-item is typically used instead of an ion-list but it can be combined with ion-label

05:51.490 --> 05:57.870
and ion-input or other similar form controls outside of ion-list or inside of ion-list,

05:57.880 --> 05:59.430
that really does not matter,

05:59.440 --> 06:04.270
the important thing here is the combination with label and input to get that nice floating effect or

06:04.450 --> 06:10.480
there also are other effects but to basically have these two components, label and input work together

06:10.480 --> 06:11.650
fine

06:11.650 --> 06:16.690
and other than that, it's a wrapper component that provides certain styling based on the wrapped content

06:16.690 --> 06:22.070
you could say and it also just works nicely together with the ion-list.

06:22.150 --> 06:28.390
It also does have these slots which are especially useful when it is placed inside of a list for having

06:28.390 --> 06:32.860
items at the start or the end or the middle of the ion-item.

06:32.860 --> 06:38.820
Now for the label, it contains texts or multiple text containing elements like h1's, paragraphs and

06:38.820 --> 06:39.820
so on,

06:39.820 --> 06:45.100
it's typically used inside of an ion-item, no matter if you're using it to combine it with an input

06:45.190 --> 06:51.130
or just to output text because if you're using other text, if you have a normal paragraph somewhere on

06:51.130 --> 06:58.600
your page or let's say inside of an ion-column, of an ion-grid, then you don't need to use an ion-label

06:58.690 --> 07:04.660
just to output text, so ion-label really has that kind of loose connection to ion-item.

07:04.660 --> 07:10.030
But in general, you could use it anywhere where you need to wrap text, ion-label will never do any

07:10.030 --> 07:10.920
harm there,

07:10.990 --> 07:18.220
you just might not see any effect because its special effects are related to ion-item. Other than that,

07:18.250 --> 07:20.660
it just gives you some basic styling,

07:20.680 --> 07:25.420
there also is a dedicated ion-text component which gives you more control,

07:25.450 --> 07:26.840
so let's have a look at that now.
