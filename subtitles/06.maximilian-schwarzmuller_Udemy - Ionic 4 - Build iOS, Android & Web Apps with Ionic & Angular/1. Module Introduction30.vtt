Now that we're able to switch between the different pages in our application,

00:06.590 --> 00:12.710
the next skill obviously is to fill these pages with some life and no matter which application you'll

00:12.710 --> 00:19.870
be building, for that you'll need the many widgets and components the Ionic framework gives you.

00:20.300 --> 00:25.520
And therefore in this module, we'll dive a bit deeper into that and I'll walk you through some of the

00:25.520 --> 00:31.370
most important Ionic components, how to use them, how to use them together and how to use them in our

00:31.370 --> 00:33.880
application here. To be precise,

00:33.890 --> 00:42.620
we'll have a look at how we can use attributes and slots of components, since pretty much all Ionic components

00:42.680 --> 00:48.620
offer you different attributes or properties to configure them and a lot of them also give you these

00:48.710 --> 00:52.730
slots and we'll dive into what these slots really are.

00:52.760 --> 00:59.570
We'll then have a closer look at this grid layout which we already used, the ion-grid but I'll then walk

00:59.570 --> 01:05.840
you through it in detail and explain how you can configure it for all kinds of different layouts you

01:05.840 --> 01:12.830
might want to have. We'll thereafter dive into some crucial components like ion-list, ion-item, ion-label,

01:12.830 --> 01:19.600
and also things like virtual scrolling and advanced features like that.

01:20.030 --> 01:26.390
We'll then dive in general into more components we'll need in our application and that might be interesting

01:26.390 --> 01:27.800
to you as well

01:27.860 --> 01:33.860
and last but not least, we'll dive from to some other controller components which are essentially the

01:33.860 --> 01:42.050
components you don't add by adding them in your templates but by injecting their service or their controller

01:42.050 --> 01:46.520
class as we did it for the modal controller for example.

01:46.580 --> 01:48.780
So lots of ground to cover,

01:48.800 --> 01:50.150
let's get started.
