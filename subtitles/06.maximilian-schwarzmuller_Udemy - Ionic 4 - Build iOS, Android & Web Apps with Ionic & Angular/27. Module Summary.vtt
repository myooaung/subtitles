In this course module we added native device features like the camera to our projects and you learned

00:09.070 --> 00:09.930
how to do that.

You also learn how to access the storage both the file system as well data storage for your non file

Very important features features.

00:19.720 --> 00:25.810
You will probably need in your next project and after this section you should feel confident using them.

00:25.810 --> 00:31.150
You should have a solid understanding on where to learn more about all a way that will native device

00:31.150 --> 00:35.440
features how to add them to your project and how then in the end to use them.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.690
The same is true for storage.

00:37.690 --> 00:43.080
With that you really have a solid understanding of how to build AI on two applications.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.360
You built a lot of different iconic two applications.

00:46.360 --> 00:52.630
