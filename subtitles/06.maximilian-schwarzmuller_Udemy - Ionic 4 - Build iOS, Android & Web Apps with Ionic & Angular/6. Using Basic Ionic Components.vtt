00:02.260 --> 00:08.920
In that budget planner here, I want to build a mobile-like looking application and I basically want

00:08.920 --> 00:13.940
to have a header, some toolbar at the top which displays the title of the app,

00:13.960 --> 00:15.850
something like budget planner

00:15.850 --> 00:22.780
and then I want to have the main content below that toolbar where I essentially want to have an input

00:22.780 --> 00:29.690
field where I can enter some titles, some names, some description of an expense and then also the value,

00:29.690 --> 00:31.840
the amount of the expense,

00:31.840 --> 00:37.960
have a button which I can press and then a list below of that where I basically output all my expenses

00:38.070 --> 00:44.650
and at the very bottom of that and maybe a little sum where I see the total sum of the expenses.

00:44.650 --> 00:52.150
Now for this if we have a look at the official docs, this ion-app and ion-content here is important,

00:52.320 --> 00:55.570
ion-app should always wrap your entire Ionic app

00:55.600 --> 01:01.690
and this basically just ensures that some general stylings and behaviors are set, so we can already do

01:01.690 --> 01:02.210
that.

01:02.290 --> 01:10.240
We can add ion-app in here and we only use this once per HTML file you could say or later if

01:10.240 --> 01:17.410
you use Angular which all runs on one and the same single page, one HTML file, you only use it as a global

01:17.410 --> 01:23.070
wrapper in your root component, you never use this anywhere else. In there,

01:23.230 --> 01:30.310
we can have our ion-content and this is a wrapper to our main application content.

01:30.310 --> 01:31.590
Now why would we add this?

01:31.630 --> 01:37.270
Because for example this controls the scrolling and makes sure that our content generally just works

01:37.270 --> 01:39.300
and is displayed correctly,

01:39.370 --> 01:43.660
so let's add ion-content but I also wanted it to have a header.

01:43.870 --> 01:49.930
So if you go back to the official docs and you scroll to the very bottom here on the left, you should find

01:49.930 --> 01:54.970
that toolbar area and in the end, it is such a toolbar which I want to add.

01:55.390 --> 02:00.580
Now as you can learn here, if a toolbar is placed in an ion-header, it will appear fixed at the top

02:00.580 --> 02:03.740
of the content and that is exactly what I want.

02:03.760 --> 02:10.090
So inside my ion-app above the ion-content, I'll add ion-header and in the ion-header, I'll add my

02:10.090 --> 02:11.700
ion-toolbar.

02:11.860 --> 02:17.890
Now in that toolbar, I want to have a title and indeed here, we see that ion-title and that is a component

02:17.890 --> 02:23.740
that sets the title of a toolbar and we see a usage example here and I'm basically just rebuilding this

02:23.740 --> 02:25.070
example now.

02:25.120 --> 02:34.370
So inside of ion-toolbar, we can add ion-title and name this budget planner. If I now save this, let

02:34.370 --> 02:42.870
me double-click that index.html file to just open it in the browser and we should see something

02:42.870 --> 02:43.610
like this,

02:43.620 --> 02:46.950
we have this nice header at the top with budget planner in here

02:47.100 --> 02:52.860
and if we open the dev tools and we go to that mobile preview here by clicking this icon in the Chrome

02:52.860 --> 02:57.660
dev tools, we see that this also looks good on mobile devices

02:57.660 --> 03:04.680
if we simulate them. Now also interesting if we inspect an element here, we see that here for example

03:04.680 --> 03:06.350
we have the ion-toolbar,

03:06.360 --> 03:10.620
this is really rendered into the DOM, web components are a browser feature,

03:10.630 --> 03:16.830
they're not emulated like Angular which in the end just gives us a syntax that spits out normal

03:16.830 --> 03:17.940
HTML code,

03:17.940 --> 03:22.640
this is normal HTML code now because the browser natively supports it

03:22.920 --> 03:28.710
but here we also see what's inside of this toolbar for example, that under the hood a div gets rendered

03:28.740 --> 03:30.870
and another div and so on.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.720
So you can dive into this here as well,

03:33.780 --> 03:39.200
that shadow root here simply is related to that shadow DOM concept I touched on earlier.

03:39.270 --> 03:44.900
Again if you want to learn all about that, don't hesitate to dive into my full Web Component and Stencil

03:44.940 --> 03:47.970
course but this is a good start.

03:47.960 --> 03:52.890
Now we can of course not just add these elements, we can configure them as well

03:53.130 --> 03:58.350
and therefore let's go back to the toolbar and I'm just showing you this because I want you to get into

03:58.350 --> 04:01.490
the habit of using these docs because it's so important,

04:01.560 --> 04:03.440
I of course know what we could configure there

04:03.540 --> 04:05.580
but I want you to understand it as well.

04:06.120 --> 04:11.180
So let's go to the docs and there to the toolbar and there we learn how we could add buttons,

04:11.250 --> 04:16.710
something we'll also do later in the course to for example have a button that allows us to add a new

04:16.710 --> 04:20.650
item and we see some general usage examples,

04:20.680 --> 04:24.420
also with a back button which we'll later need, not right now

04:24.420 --> 04:27.480
and if we scroll further down, we see the properties we can set

04:27.570 --> 04:33.920
and I'm interested in that color property which we can set to primary, secondary and so on, to these base

04:34.020 --> 04:38.570
colors which we can also overwrite and set our own colors of course

04:38.640 --> 04:41.010
and that is also something we'll do later.

04:41.070 --> 04:48.650
So let's go to the toolbar and add a color of primary maybe and if we do that, we save that and we go

04:48.650 --> 04:50.790
back to our application and we reload,

04:50.840 --> 04:53.420
we now simply have this blue background

04:53.420 --> 04:59.720
but please also note that the title of color also adjusted, it's now white and the title of course is

04:59.720 --> 05:01.030
a separate component.

05:01.130 --> 05:05.720
So these components even work together here which is of course pretty cool.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.730
So that is our header,

05:07.730 --> 05:09.200
now what about the content?
