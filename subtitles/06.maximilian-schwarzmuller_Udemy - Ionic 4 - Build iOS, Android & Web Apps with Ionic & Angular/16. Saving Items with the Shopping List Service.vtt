00:01.930 --> 00:07.870
In the last lecture we trade our shopping lists service let's now make sure that we actually add this

00:07.870 --> 00:09.180
created item.

00:09.280 --> 00:15.550
When you submit the form to the service now you have all the knowledge you need to do this on your own.

00:15.550 --> 00:22.750
So an average challenge for you go to your shopping list page component here and make sure that in on

00:22.750 --> 00:29.200
an item you some will get access to your shopping list service and that you add an item to this array

00:29.410 --> 00:32.330
of ingredients stored in the service.

00:32.560 --> 00:38.440
You will kind of need to inject this service for debt and all think about on which level you're going

00:38.440 --> 00:40.300
to provide to service.

00:40.550 --> 00:41.990
Now's the time to pause the video.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.270
Let's do this together in a couple of seconds.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.110
So were you successful.

00:48.370 --> 00:55.270
Let's start by providing the service we do it is in the app module here in the provider's array.

00:55.510 --> 01:00.460
You could provide it on component level but we're actually going to access the shopping list service

01:00.730 --> 01:02.810
from another place in the app too.

01:02.860 --> 01:08.140
So I will provide it on an application level to make sure that the same instance of this service is

01:08.140 --> 01:13.760
used for the whole app because of course it's important that these array of ingredients stored in the

01:13.760 --> 01:16.090
service only exists once.

01:16.460 --> 01:24.480
So here I will simply inject or not inject provide a shopping list service and therefore also add the

01:24.490 --> 01:29.450
import here at the top pointing to the shopping lists service file in the services folder.

01:30.010 --> 01:37.870
And with this added to a module I can now go to the shopping list typescript file here on an item and

01:37.870 --> 01:41.050
you don't want to access to service so I will need to inject that.

01:41.050 --> 01:46.000
Why the constructor a pointer to a property named s.l service.

01:46.030 --> 01:52.090
Of course you choose any other name and I'll name it shopping list to them and I'll use the type shopping

01:52.090 --> 01:58.000
list service which of course also needs to be imported from the shopping list file and the services

01:58.000 --> 01:59.410
folder.

01:59.410 --> 02:04.530
Now with this I make the service available in this component and an on an item.

02:04.570 --> 02:08.280
I can therefore then call a shopping list service add item.

02:08.290 --> 02:10.660
We add this method on the last lecture.

02:10.800 --> 02:19.940
And here I simply want to use the form I get submitted a year access the value of this form and I know

02:20.420 --> 02:26.400
that the name of this Ingredion will be stored in a controlled named ingredient name right.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.040
So I will use this name.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.900
This property will exist on this value object.

02:31.070 --> 02:32.870
And the same is true for the amount.

02:32.870 --> 02:38.600
These are the two controls I registered as I'm passing the values from my form to the service and then

02:38.600 --> 02:42.890
the service I will trade a new ingredient and added to the array of ingredients.

02:43.220 --> 02:51.470
Well and with this I then want to reset the form so I can call form reset like this to empty the input

02:51.470 --> 02:55.880
fields and reset the validation state of the form.

02:55.940 --> 03:01.110
Does this now all I need to do to create a new item on the form.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.440
We will be able to do this.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.770
However we won't be able to see this.

03:06.050 --> 03:12.080
Let's at least add a console lock to the shopping list here in the add item Smethurst indeed item effort

03:12.110 --> 03:18.520
excuse me where I console LARC this ingredient so that we can see if it worked.

03:18.550 --> 03:24.890
And with that if we save it let's go back to our running application and let's add a new item.

03:24.890 --> 03:28.000
For example brat 10 items at.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.090
And you see indeed a new ingredient was added.

03:31.340 --> 03:35.180
Let's add another one to check if this also works.

03:35.180 --> 03:36.670
Now we get two ingredients.

03:36.770 --> 03:39.740
So our array is get getting populated correctly.

03:39.740 --> 03:40.960
That looks great.

03:40.970 --> 03:46.500
The next step is to actually display those items below the input here.

03:46.550 --> 03:52.410
So on the shopping list page here we'll start working on this in the next lecture.
