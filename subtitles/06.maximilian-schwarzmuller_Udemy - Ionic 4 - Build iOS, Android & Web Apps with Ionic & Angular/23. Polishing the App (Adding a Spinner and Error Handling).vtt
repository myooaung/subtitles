00:02.050 --> 00:06.680
Were able to store and load data though the loading still has a little glitch at the end when we don't

00:06.740 --> 00:09.860
update the page though that will be solved soon.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.620
Let's now start working on polishing this.

00:12.620 --> 00:18.620
And one way to polish this would be to show a loader while we're loading We don't have any visual indication

00:18.620 --> 00:21.860
that something's happening and that's not a great user experience.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.790
So let's actually add sucha user experience.

00:24.860 --> 00:26.690
Let's start with a loader.

00:26.750 --> 00:33.950
There's little Spener we used before all add a new controller here a loading controller inject it into

00:33.950 --> 00:36.420
our component here into our page.

00:36.440 --> 00:40.250
Make sure to import loading controller from ionic angular.

00:40.430 --> 00:46.880
And with that inject that in on show options I want to present this little loader so I'll initialize

00:46.880 --> 00:54.040
it here loading this loading controller create and pass some options to configure it.

00:54.170 --> 00:58.270
Well the only option I do need is to content where else simply say please wait.

00:58.280 --> 01:03.710
Of course you may choose a number of text and then as soon as we dismiss the pop over and were loading

01:03.710 --> 01:10.600
data I will present this loading motile here does loading the U.

01:10.730 --> 01:16.010
It's not a modalist loading us should say I'll do the same in the IF case.

01:16.070 --> 01:21.620
However the issue is if we just dismiss the pop over without clicking a button we would always see that

01:21.620 --> 01:23.880
loader and we wouldn't get rid of it.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.770
So actually change this too.

01:25.780 --> 01:33.580
ELSE IF and then check if data action equals store and of course you could also use a switch statement.

01:33.770 --> 01:38.240
And again I'm keeping this code very explicit to make it easier to understand here.

01:38.540 --> 01:43.060
So only if we clicked one of the buttons will we see the loader now.

01:43.250 --> 01:49.400
And with this someplace else you want to dismiss the loader of course and I do this in the success case

01:49.400 --> 01:57.010
here whenever we basically are done here and I all do it in the error case.

01:57.140 --> 02:00.320
So therefore you're in this first call bag.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.650
I will use my loader or x' it and dismiss it too.

02:04.710 --> 02:08.240
Don't not show it any more to say in your 40 error case.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.940
And of course the same should happen if we load our data.

02:13.090 --> 02:22.100
I therefore need to replace this code with loading dismiss instead and do the same for the error and

02:22.160 --> 02:28.070
this is not really the best error handling and logging it to the console and I'm removing this now I'm

02:28.250 --> 02:31.440
only dismissing the loader if we do get an error.

02:31.550 --> 02:38.870
I actually want to show an alert and for this I'll add a new method here handle error or where I get

02:38.930 --> 02:46.070
the error object or let's say the error message is enough so a string that you get this error message

02:46.070 --> 02:48.850
here and I want to show alert in such a case.

02:48.920 --> 02:56.750
So I will inject the alert controller alert controller like this alert controller.

02:56.750 --> 03:02.070
Also make sure to import this from my onic angular and Dan and the handle error method.

03:02.090 --> 03:08.540
What I want to do is I want to construct a new alert with this alert controller with the create method

03:08.540 --> 03:10.360
you saw this many times before.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.250
Here also the title where else say an error occurred.

03:16.220 --> 03:20.560
Then I want to have a message which will be my error message here.

03:20.570 --> 03:25.540
I'm getting in this method and I simply want to show an OK button.

03:25.730 --> 03:29.020
And of course I want to present this alert thereafter.

03:29.480 --> 03:37.250
This is how I want to handle my errors now in error or callbacks here I will simply call this handle

03:37.280 --> 03:40.870
error and pass in the error message.

03:40.880 --> 03:47.920
Of course adjuster's error handler to your data to the data you're returning in an error case.

03:48.050 --> 03:54.950
So doing the same here for the load method and with the error handling in place we get a loader in place

03:54.950 --> 04:00.880
to make this look a bit nicer if we now go back to our application letted reload and click on load.

04:00.980 --> 04:03.790
We see the lower loader now too dangerous there.

04:03.810 --> 04:08.990
Now it automatically updates because change detection is triggered since we dismissed the Lowder's so

04:08.990 --> 04:10.210
it would render the page.

04:10.220 --> 04:16.910
Anyways that is how this problem was solved along the way and if we save this this also works.

04:16.910 --> 04:20.300
Now let's see the error case that something goes wrong.

04:20.300 --> 04:25.160
For this I'll go to the shopping list and I'm going to change something here.

04:25.160 --> 04:31.040
I'll remove the token so we will not be authenticated and it is only a temporary change to see our error

04:31.070 --> 04:31.950
handler.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.070
Now we should not be able to fetch data.

04:35.210 --> 04:42.440
So after saving this and after this recompile back in the app if I now click on load liest you see an

04:42.470 --> 04:43.390
error occurred.

04:43.400 --> 04:48.580
We actually don't have a detailed error message here because firebase didn't give us one but we see

04:48.650 --> 04:53.790
something went wrong here and it is nice to have in place.

04:54.140 --> 04:59.760
With that we finished our shopping list page were able to store our shopping list on a server and retrieve

04:59.760 --> 05:00.730
it.

05:00.740 --> 05:04.420
I challenge you to now do the same for our recipes.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.340
It works pretty much exactly the same way.

05:07.450 --> 05:10.540
So you definitely should be able to do this on your own.

05:10.550 --> 05:12.340
It would be a nice practice.

05:12.410 --> 05:16.500
I'm going to start implementing this together with you in the next lecture.
