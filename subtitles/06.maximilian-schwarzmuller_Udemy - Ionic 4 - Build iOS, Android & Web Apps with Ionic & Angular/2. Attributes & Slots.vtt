WEBVTT

00:02.280 --> 00:11.620
And I want to get started with attributes and slots. If we have a look at our discover page, then there

00:11.620 --> 00:18.370
we do have our ion-card with our featured place and below that, we have our ion-list with an

00:18.370 --> 00:19.600
ion-item

00:19.600 --> 00:21.890
and there we got two interesting things.

00:21.910 --> 00:28.360
First of all, we have added a so-called attribute to the ion-item, that is this detail thing here

00:28.360 --> 00:30.910
and we also are using a slot.

00:30.910 --> 00:37.840
Now what's up with attributes and slots? Attributes are a feature you should know because they're not

00:37.840 --> 00:46.510
exclusive to Ionic or to Ionic Angular apps, instead attributes allow us to place information on HTML

00:46.540 --> 00:53.770
elements or on web components here that are then consumed by these components and that do something

00:53.830 --> 00:54.930
in these components and

00:54.970 --> 00:59.070
that's the same for vanilla HTML elements of course.

00:59.200 --> 01:06.850
Now the detail here for example is simply a property for which Ionic looks out for and when you add

01:06.850 --> 01:15.220
it, it knows that it needs to add this tiny icon, this arrow icon on the item here. Another thing that

01:15.220 --> 01:19.660
can be confusing is the difference between attributes and properties,

01:19.660 --> 01:25.260
I use these terms interchangeably but actually, they're not entirely the same.

01:25.330 --> 01:33.160
This here is an attribute, whatever you place on your element selector, on this tag is an attribute. An

01:33.190 --> 01:40.390
attribute then internally by that component is typically bound to a property of that component and

01:40.390 --> 01:44.250
a property is simply like a variable inside of a class,

01:44.260 --> 01:47.770
so place here for example would be a property of the place

01:47.770 --> 01:54.610
detail page class. Web components and native HTML elements also are based on such classes in the end

01:54.700 --> 02:01.480
you could say, they are based on Javascript objects and these objects do have properties and the attributes

02:01.720 --> 02:08.890
are just the HTML way of assigning values to these properties. You can also assign values to them

02:09.130 --> 02:15.820
by directly selecting the element though and then assigning a property in Javascript or in Typescript

02:15.820 --> 02:16.370
here.

02:16.390 --> 02:21.820
So that's just something which is not super important for us here because it doesn't really make a difference

02:21.820 --> 02:27.970
for us here but it is worth noting that in theory, an attribute is what you assign here and a property

02:27.970 --> 02:33.490
would be whatever you use in your Typescript code, like here when I assign something to this place, then

02:33.490 --> 02:39.220
I'm assigning this to the place property not to a place attribute and this place detail component here

02:39.220 --> 02:44.680
by the way wouldn't even work with a place attribute because we haven't made place bindable with

02:44.740 --> 02:46.330
@input here.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.070
So that is one thing,

02:48.070 --> 02:51.640
the other important thing is the slot.

02:51.850 --> 02:58.120
If we have a look at the discover page, we see that the thumbnail here has a slot of start. Now slots

02:58.120 --> 03:03.920
are not an Ionic feature, they are also a feature you don't see in Angular apps though,

03:03.940 --> 03:13.060
so where are slots coming from? Slots are a web component feature and web components is a term of specifications

03:13.060 --> 03:21.250
that are built into the browser, so native web features. A slot allows you to define a place in your web

03:21.250 --> 03:25.010
component where external content can be rendered in.

03:25.120 --> 03:31.720
So this slot here for example refers to the ion-item which basically reserves a place inside of its

03:31.810 --> 03:39.730
internal DOM where this part here with the slot start on should be rendered in. That becomes even clearer

03:39.850 --> 03:48.460
if you dive into the official source code, if you visit the Github repository of these Ionic components which

03:48.460 --> 03:50.930
you'll find on the Ionic repository,

03:51.010 --> 04:01.270
then under core source components and there, you look for the item component, here. If you dive into

04:01.270 --> 04:10.700
that item.tsx file, you will in the end see if you scroll down what actually gets rendered here in

04:10.700 --> 04:11.890
this render method.

04:11.880 --> 04:18.490
Now this is just how Stencil, the compiler used by Ionic to build these web components works but in

04:18.490 --> 04:25.780
the end, this is some HTML code you could say, it's actual JSX but doesn't matter, it's like HTML

04:25.960 --> 04:31.930
which gets rendered. Now as you see, this essentially defines which kind of tag it should render, that

04:31.990 --> 04:38.410
either is a button or an anchor tag or a div depending on some attributes that you may have set or

04:38.410 --> 04:39.290
not set

04:39.490 --> 04:45.910
and then inside of this wrapping tag which is again a button, an anchor tag or a div, you see this slot thing.

04:46.360 --> 04:53.560
And that in the end defines OK any element inside of your ion-item that does have a slot of start will

04:53.560 --> 04:55.050
be rendered here,

04:55.150 --> 05:00.700
anything that does not have a specific slot set takes that default slot here which is in the middle

05:00.850 --> 05:05.890
of these two wrapping divs which basically will assign some styling

05:05.890 --> 05:11.410
and then you also have that slot with the name end. Now you also don't have to dive into the official

05:11.410 --> 05:17.920
source code to find out which slots you can set, in the Ionic component documentation if you go to the

05:17.920 --> 05:25.090
item, there you also find information about the settable slots. But slots are basically your way of telling

05:25.090 --> 05:32.830
Ionic where in this item to put a certain content and this ensures that the thumbnail content, this

05:32.890 --> 05:39.010
image here gets placed all the way on the left of this item or at the start of this item to be precise,

05:40.180 --> 05:46.510
where it is depends on your region settings and so on and that this part which does not have an explicit

05:46.600 --> 05:52.070
slot assignment gets rendered in that default slot in the middle.

05:52.240 --> 05:59.080
This is how slots works and what you have to know about attributes, we'll use both heavily in this course

05:59.110 --> 06:04.990
since Ionic uses them heavily and therefore it is important to understand what you're doing when you're

06:04.990 --> 06:06.940
assigning attributes or slots.
