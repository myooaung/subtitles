00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.730
The menu has been created in theory.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.260
Let's now add the menu item the menu item should be displayed on the favorites page.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.700
The library page and of course also the settings page.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.480
Let's start with the favorites page with the template of the favorites page.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.350
We want to display this button for the menu in the nav bar of this page.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.080
So here I'm going to add a button and this button gets the button directive and I'll add.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.090
I can actually I will only have all I can no text at all.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.370
And the name of the icons menu.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.820
Now let's save this and see how this looks like.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.870
Well we have a button we can click it.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.790
It won't open them open the menu yet.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.460
We'll work on this a second.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.560
But it's not super pretty.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.580
Would be nice of a different kind of button here.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:04.760
Well we can change this by wrapping the button into another component which is called Iron buttons and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.950
buttons is used in the nav bar to group your buttons in the neph bar.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.760
Obviously there is limited space in the nav bar so you shouldn't place 100 buttons in there but to align

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.060
them nicely you're typically placed in iron patterns and then you can add a directive to it.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.510
For example start to tell I on to where you want to place them but be the opposite.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.740
And if I do this wrap the button and I'm patens some place and on it you see now it looks nicer and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.930
it's on the right.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.450
If I change just to start it will switch to the left.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.820
And of course if I have multiple iron buttons here let me simply duplicate this to demonstrate it where

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.920
I have one with start and one with and you see now I have both buttons nicely aligned.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.270
So when working with buttons in your nav bar you should wrap them in iron buttons to control where they

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.880
sit and to have them look nice.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.680
There's just something to memorize when using buttons in the nav bar.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.560
Use iron buttons to group them to place them and position them with that to get the menu button but

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.740
still not opening our menu.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.150
We can achieve this by adding a click listener.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:29.940
You say on open menu for example and now any type of class I'm adding this on open menu and we control

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.330
the Menu Foods menu controller as you learned earlier.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.560
So let me quickly add this here private menu controller menu controller like this.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.590
Make sure to imported from ionic angler.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.390
There's just the correct import.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.440
And then in there in on open menu can say this menu controller open and this will open the menu you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.870
configured in your root component so that quickly reloaders appier you now click on this.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.070
It opens the menu and you can see we can go to the settings page just already work so replacing the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.080
root page and closing the menu works correctly.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.300
However.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.940
It's kind of annoying that we have to implement this on our menu inject the menu controller import the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.290
tear and repeat all of that on every page where we want to be able to open the menu.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.430
Thankfully there is a shortcut.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.390
I'm going to remove all of that.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.130
Remove the import removed injection remove the method and then the template I'm going to remove the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.070
click.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.110
Because I don't talk to you.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.230
Thankfully offering us a helpful directive.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.570
It's called menue toggle and it does what the name applies.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.660
It allows us to toggle our menu to open and close it.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.490
So if we implement this save it and let it recompile let it reload.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.900
You see now I can easily toggle the menu here without having to implement all the code on my own.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.590
The menu of course still works as before.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.950
Now with that we can implement this.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.040
I unbuttons group here at the bottom with the menu tag class on it.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.790
Every girl we want to implemented that would all be the library file.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.440
And of course the settings page.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.570
The first time we touched the settings page let me get rid of this.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.080
Implement the button will work on the rest of this template later.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.950
Let me save this and now you should see that we have a button here and here.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.270
Not if we select a category because then we have the back button and I don't want to have a menu button

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.770
here.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.150
You could add it on the right of course with the ion buttons and then and bulliest on it.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.080
And of course we also have it here on the settings page allowing us to go back to the taps page.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.640
Awesome.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.730
With that we implemented the side menu.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.470
You saw that this also splits up our navigation stack.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.980
You learned how to add a button to toggle it.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.230
You learn how to replace the root page.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.570
The missing piece now is to implement the settings page to manage our settings and to display an alternative

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.400
background.
