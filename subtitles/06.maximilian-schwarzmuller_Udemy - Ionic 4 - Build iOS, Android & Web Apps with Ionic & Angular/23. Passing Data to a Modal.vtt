00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.450
Now that we're able to dismiss the modal let's enable ourselves to pass some data to the mold which

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.910
we can display here back in the editor in the favorites page where we view the mole we can pass data

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.230
to the model as a second argument and the create method here on the modal controller here.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.960
We can pass any data just like with push on the nav controller.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.000
So the data we can pass here or we want to pass your of course to quote We're getting as an argument

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.250
here.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.550
The quote We clicked on that quote quote this past us de-selected code to the mole.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.280
Now in the mole We of course somehow want to access this data.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.460
How do we do it.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.810
The cool thing is just like we ex-state when we get data why the push method wya neth parents.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.430
This doesn't change.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.640
So even though it's not loaded enough controller we still get the data from Neph parents make for sure

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.530
to add to import from ionic angler.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.500
And then with that we can retrieve the data.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.790
Now of course the question again is when should you retrieve the data.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.450
Now let's try out iron view debt load.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.000
So when the page was created let's try to extract the data here.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.410
I will store the quote data you're in let's say in two properties just to mix it up to have a separate

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.920
offer property and a text property or name a person to be in line with the codes object.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:51.550
And then here I could say this person equals this naff parents and then get person remember the data

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.130
we get here simply is the quote and the quote has a person and a text property and I.D. but we don't

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.510
need that here.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.240
So we get the person here and for text.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.120
Well we get the text with data and go to our aged team file and let's output the person in the title

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.640
and the text here in the content.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.470
Let me save this and see if it works as intended.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.760
In the running application.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.080
So let's again add a quote to our favorites.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.390
Click on the quote and here we are.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.800
So the important takeaway here is that if you all I interviewed did load to your quote page.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.050
It is called.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.560
Now you could think that it gets not that it doesn't get cold because it's not added through the nav

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:54.330
controller with push to the stack of pages but the mobile overlay is the top most page view.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.000
Therefore by Ironic too it's kind of treated like a page loaded fruity nav controller even though technically

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.660
and this is important it's not loaded with.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.460
We have obviously loaded for the modal control but it is created in a similar way because I want it

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.130
to correctly decides well in the end.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.190
It is the page you're viewing no matter if it's the top most page on my stack of pages or an overlay

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.800
to that topmost page.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.640
This is why I you did load gets executed.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.490
And let's also check if it correctly displays a number quote.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.450
So now that I have two quotes here we see Theodore Roosevelt.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.400
Now let's also check the quote.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.510
Looks good.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.950
So the modal object here is not cached.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.460
It is re-iterated.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.930
And if there was not the case we would not see a changed person in text because I included load is only

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.130
executed if we're not getting this page from the cache.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.290
So this works as intended.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.420
Now the next thing to hook up or to make work of course is this.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.330
And favorite but here we should for one all too close to more.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.680
But then as a second step also well remove this quote from our favorite quotes.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.850
Let's do this next
