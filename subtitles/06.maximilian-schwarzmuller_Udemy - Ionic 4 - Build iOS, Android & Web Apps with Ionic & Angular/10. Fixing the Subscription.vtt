Now one important thing which I've forgotten the last lecture here when we subscribed to user I.D. Of

00:07.350 --> 00:09.610
course we only want to take one year.

00:09.660 --> 00:15.420
We don't want to set up an ongoing subscription to whenever it is changes anywhere in the app but only

00:15.420 --> 00:16.920
when that filter is clicked.

00:16.920 --> 00:23.280
When we click that segment that button then we want to get to curtly signed into user I.D. and therefore

00:23.370 --> 00:24.600
all add pipe.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.730
Take one year and that of course means stats to take.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.580
Operator here needs to be imported from our exchange as operators in that discover page.

00:35.610 --> 00:38.140
Yes file not forgot doesn't The Last Lecture.

00:38.190 --> 00:41.240
So definitely make sure to add this year by the way.

00:41.310 --> 00:46.920
If you seem to forget this later in this module no worries I will definitely fix that just as I did

00:46.920 --> 00:47.220
here.
