WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:03.920
We got some other places in the application.

00:03.920 --> 00:04.770
We want to work on.

00:04.790 --> 00:10.490
For example if I tap a place here to view dead detail page forward offer.

00:10.760 --> 00:18.380
Not only is it a bit of a boring page as I recognize here but that could be okay here but we also get

00:18.380 --> 00:19.500
an error here.

00:19.610 --> 00:23.370
If I tap that page cannot read property ideas off on the find.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.710
So we want to fix that.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.900
It does the same on the Discover here on the Discover area.

00:27.920 --> 00:34.580
If I click a place here I get that same error or not that same but a similar error related to that.

00:34.670 --> 00:40.930
So we certainly want to make sure that we fix these places and let's do that right now.

00:40.970 --> 00:45.560
So the first place here is to offer bookings page.

00:46.370 --> 00:54.090
However I do read need that pager will simply get rid of that and then the place routing module of course

00:54.100 --> 00:58.220
make sure that we get rid of it here as well.

00:59.150 --> 01:05.850
We simply don't support this anymore in the offers page each time I'll file a deal from one to make

01:05.850 --> 01:09.440
sure when we click and all for item here we're not going anywhere.

01:09.450 --> 01:14.520
So I still display my offers we can still slide them but we just can click them anymore cause that is

01:14.520 --> 01:16.320
not the fix I want to use.

01:16.320 --> 01:22.860
On the Discover area where we have a place detail page that makes more sense here under a place detail

01:23.460 --> 01:26.560
we're getting errors because no place detail types could file.

01:26.670 --> 01:32.990
I call get place and there I initialize the place which I then use in my template but just as before

01:33.060 --> 01:37.980
get placed now reaches out to a server and they offer this takes a bit longer to complete and hence

01:37.980 --> 01:39.470
place is not is set.

01:39.470 --> 01:42.580
Initially of course the solution is simple.

01:42.810 --> 01:50.010
Again we can add a is loading property and set it to false here and whenever we start fetching our place

01:50.100 --> 01:59.320
we set is loading whips is loading to true and once we're done fetching it here we said this is loading

01:59.670 --> 02:05.530
two false and now with that we can add a spinner in the template again.

02:05.530 --> 02:14.560
So here I got my grid which displays all the place data and I only want to show that if we're not loading

02:15.040 --> 02:21.910
if we are loading then I will add a diff here with text center and then that div I will add that I end

02:21.910 --> 02:26.890
spinner with a color of primary and justice before here.

02:26.890 --> 02:32.590
I will add energy if is loading I'll not check for whether we did fetch a place or not.

02:32.590 --> 02:35.610
Instead I Robert add error handling that frozen error.

02:35.710 --> 02:42.490
If we found no place because you could argue that for the Discover list page here it makes sense to

02:42.490 --> 02:48.050
show a message like no bankable places found if there are no places for a single place you could of

02:48.050 --> 02:49.990
course also show on screen message.

02:49.990 --> 02:55.840
But if you are on that page that has no other purpose well then you can also just throw in a error or

02:55.840 --> 02:58.180
show an alert if no data was found.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.040
That is my logic here.

03:00.070 --> 03:01.720
Nonetheless a spinner should be shown.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.150
So is loading certainly makes sense.

03:04.210 --> 03:09.080
We should be aware that we also use some place data and a title here though and that they are.

03:09.100 --> 03:15.790
I want to check WEBER Where is loading we're loading and if we are loading then I'll say loading here

03:15.790 --> 03:19.680
as a text and only for not loading I'll try to output the place.

03:19.870 --> 03:25.650
So now every saved is and this page reloads here it does so without an error.

03:26.220 --> 03:30.710
And if I go there from this page we got the same behavior.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.810
We also saw the spinner here for a short time.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.370
So this is now a better user experience.

03:36.370 --> 03:39.110
Let's now at the error handling I was talking about.

03:39.220 --> 03:44.530
And for that we add this second method here where we get the error.

03:44.530 --> 03:50.860
The second function here to subscribe where we get this error object which would hold data like error

03:50.860 --> 03:52.460
message sent by the server.

03:52.480 --> 03:58.150
So this can also be useful depending on your app and your server you're interacting with.

03:58.150 --> 04:04.970
Here I will again use the same approach as before I will inject the alert controller here.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.900
Lot of controllers getting injected in this page.

04:07.900 --> 04:17.020
So inject the alert controller from at ionic angular and then simply created here with a header of an

04:17.110 --> 04:28.730
error or occurred and then a message where I say could not load lays or any message that you want to

04:28.730 --> 04:32.540
show could be based on the error message encoded in the error object.

04:32.690 --> 04:38.750
If your back end is throwing helpful messages there and then I'll add my buttons where I have my button

04:38.750 --> 04:47.630
object with a text of OK and a handler function which is this anonymous Erol function here and then

04:47.630 --> 04:49.120
this function.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.280
I want to use my router which I need to inject.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.390
We don't have that yet.

04:53.900 --> 05:02.250
So the angular router which needs to be imported from at Anglo router does is inject that here and now

05:02.250 --> 05:13.400
I can use my router to navigate back to slash places taps discover.

05:13.460 --> 05:18.980
So basically to this route here.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.800
So now we just need to call then here where we get the alert element and then we can call alert l present

05:26.800 --> 05:28.090
here to show it.

05:28.090 --> 05:34.510
And now if we save all of that we go back to that page here and we added It's such that we try to fetch

05:34.510 --> 05:40.210
a place but that doesn't exist by editing the U.R.L. we get that alert compress.

05:40.210 --> 05:42.050
Okay and here we are.

05:42.070 --> 05:48.880
So this now all that works and now we should have the most important pieces off the zap in a state that

05:49.000 --> 05:53.170
works and that ensures that we can interact with it.

05:53.230 --> 05:59.080
Now let's of course focus on the bookings that when we make a booking we save that on the server too.

05:59.140 --> 06:04.300
And that we can also see our list of bookings here and definitely try implementing this on your own

06:04.300 --> 06:05.070
first.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.910
You will basically use the same building blocks you'll learn about for all at this module.

06:08.920 --> 06:14.740
So this is a great challenge and a great exercise and you can then compare your solution to mine over

06:14.740 --> 06:15.670
the next lectures.
