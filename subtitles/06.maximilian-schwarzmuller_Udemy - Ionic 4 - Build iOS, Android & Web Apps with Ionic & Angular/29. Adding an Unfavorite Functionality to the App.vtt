00:02.320 --> 00:07.230
If we have a look at the application we book thus far it's already looking pretty nice.

00:07.250 --> 00:14.180
We get the core functionality or most finished we are able to do your quotes here to favorite them in

00:14.180 --> 00:18.250
the first place to unfavorite them and to favorite them again.

00:18.410 --> 00:24.140
But one thing we're not doing is we're not preventing ourselves from favorites in the same quote multiple

00:24.140 --> 00:26.300
times like this.

00:26.300 --> 00:33.440
So it would be good to actually be able to switch just favorite button for a unfavored button on this

00:33.440 --> 00:38.950
card here too so that we're not able to favorite the same quote multiple times.

00:39.050 --> 00:40.700
Let's work on this next.

00:41.090 --> 00:46.250
In order to be able to unfavored a quote I need to go to the quotes page.

00:46.250 --> 00:49.240
This is where we are able to favorite a quote right.

00:49.340 --> 00:55.550
So there we should also implement a button which allows us to unfavored a quote to do so I will simply

00:55.550 --> 01:02.060
copy this back near the favorite button and paste it in right below the other one here.

01:02.090 --> 01:10.190
I also want to add color danger to make it red and of course name ID unfavorite And of course I don't

01:10.190 --> 01:12.670
want to execute on at two favorite.

01:12.860 --> 01:24.000
I want to execute on remove from favorites maybe also rename this to on add two favorites to be in line.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.110
All has to quote here though.

01:26.570 --> 01:31.630
Also rename on adds two favorites on ADD to favorites since I just change this.

01:32.030 --> 01:37.120
And of course I also need a new method on remove from favorites here.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.940
And I noted I will get the quote to be removed here as an argument.

01:42.180 --> 01:45.630
Now right now it would display both buttons all the time.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.680
And this certainly is not what I want.

01:47.840 --> 01:53.040
I only want to display the favorite button if the cloud does not currently a favorite of myself and

01:53.120 --> 01:57.290
display the unfair rebuttal if it is now to do this.

01:57.290 --> 02:03.830
I'll implement a helper method in my code start to use file in the typescript file and I'll simply name

02:03.830 --> 02:08.740
it is favorite because it should check if this actually is a favorite or not.

02:08.810 --> 02:14.510
It of course receives the quote for which you should check this and then I can check if this is a favorite

02:14.510 --> 02:18.290
quote by going to my quote service and adding a new helper method.

02:18.300 --> 02:25.160
There are also named this is quote favorite so here.

02:25.160 --> 02:33.860
I also expect to get a quote which of course of type quote and I will simply return the result of a

02:33.860 --> 02:35.330
simple check.

02:35.510 --> 02:42.230
I will see all of my favorite quotes here in this array when using the find method which also takes

02:42.230 --> 02:47.980
a method as the argument and this method will be executed for each quote in theory.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.320
So I'll check the individual quote elements in this array.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.000
Which of course also are of type quote.

02:53.000 --> 03:07.680
Therefore if this returns true for the ID check so Id return quote element ID equals what ID so what

03:07.680 --> 03:09.020
am I doing here.

03:09.180 --> 03:16.470
I'm saying simply executing defined method on my favorite quotes array you find method takes an argument.

03:16.470 --> 03:24.060
This argument is a function which gets executed on each element in this array and this function I passed

03:24.090 --> 03:30.360
we find method needs to return true or false for each element indicating if it is the ultimate.

03:30.360 --> 03:35.550
I was looking for or not as a side note if you return true for multiple elements it will still only

03:35.550 --> 03:42.320
take the first element you return true for a year and returning true the idea of the element.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.760
I'm currently looking at in this array matches the idea of the element I was passing to this method

03:47.760 --> 03:48.450
here.

03:48.840 --> 03:56.720
So if this helper function in place here I can go back to my quotes typescript file and Indy is favorite

03:56.730 --> 04:06.720
Meffert I can simply return this quote service is quote favorite and past a quote.

04:06.800 --> 04:13.700
So if this I'm checking if this is a favorite quote and if it is well then I'd certainly want to display

04:13.700 --> 04:18.680
the unfavorite button so I can use the as favorite method here in my template.

04:18.890 --> 04:25.960
Together with NGF like this and I only want to show the is favorite button.

04:25.990 --> 04:33.760
If it's not a favorite so the inverse is favorite is there for faults on the other hand I want to display

04:33.760 --> 04:35.880
the unfavorite button.

04:36.040 --> 04:44.470
If this is true so remove the exclamation mark with this in place let me save this and see if that works

04:44.530 --> 04:45.650
as intended.

04:46.390 --> 04:50.830
If I click on a quote click on favorite now UCSC unfavorite.

04:50.920 --> 04:57.340
Of course I haven't implemented the logic to unfavorite that though so let's do this next in order to

04:57.340 --> 04:57.960
unfavorite.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.370
I'll go back to the typescript file of this page here.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.860
I already got the method to do that right on remove from favorites.

05:06.100 --> 05:12.790
This is the method I'm calling here in my template and in there I simply want to reach out to a quote

05:12.790 --> 05:19.040
service and call the remove quote from favorite's method past to quote as an argument.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.470
Save this.

05:20.470 --> 05:23.220
We already implemented this method in the servers.

05:23.350 --> 05:26.490
A few Electra's ago and were saved.

05:26.770 --> 05:31.930
Let's reload the app and let's see if this works for click on favorites year.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.970
It seems to be our favorite.

05:33.970 --> 05:36.190
We can see this on the favorite's page.

05:36.430 --> 05:44.190
If I go back and click unfavorite easy it switches back and it's all removed from the favorite's page.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.190
So this works great.

05:45.190 --> 05:50.440
Our state management works and now we're able to check if this already is our favorite And therefore

05:50.440 --> 05:54.530
we prevent that we add the same object multiple times.

05:54.550 --> 06:01.060
We can still add our quote of course though this was never a major step.

06:01.060 --> 06:07.840
Now I want to do a little bit fine tuning on my favorites page here before we Denne implement a side

06:07.840 --> 06:13.750
menu with the settings before we then changed the theming before we Denn are done with our first app

06:14.110 --> 06:15.420
loads of new information.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.270
But I hope you're still enjoying it.
