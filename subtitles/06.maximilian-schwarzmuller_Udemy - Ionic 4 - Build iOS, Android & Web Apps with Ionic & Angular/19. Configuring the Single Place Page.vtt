00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.060
We're displaying our image here on the card on the home page.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.480
Now I mentioned that I want to center the text here so let's simply add text center to ion card content

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.040
to centered this title and description so that this looks nice.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.900
And then I want to hook up this on open place method to open this single place page.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.980
So on open place will receive the place as an argument.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.830
This will be of type place.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.480
We're already importing this model so we don't need to add the import and endless method.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.810
I now want to open this single place page as a model.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.220
Therefore I don't need the nav controller here but I will need the modal controllers.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's quickly inject this year to modem a controller like this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.350
Make sure you imported from my onic angler.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.770
We can remove nav control now and then in an open place.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.190
I want to use this Modal controller to create a modal and of course I will treat this Modal on my single

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.750
place abse place page like this.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.510
Make sure to import this page at the top too.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.030
Of course this should be stored in Xyrem constant and then I can simply pre-sent the modal to open this

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.520
detail page in the modal.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.010
Though of course I also want to pass some data to the mole as a second argument and to create Meffert

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.800
here and the data is the place we loaded.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.720
Now any single place page I'll get rid of this comment here at the top.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.410
I don't need the nav control.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.380
I do need to have parents to extract the data.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.140
Nice challenge for you to practice this again.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.560
And removed the control import.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.020
So now try to extract replace data we're passing to that model.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.960
Shouldn't be too difficult.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.650
I'll remove this here in the meantime.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.610
So where is successful.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.850
You of course need to add a place property here like this and imported from your models folder and then

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.080
in the constructor.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.130
We can extract the data with denay parents year by getting the place property because again remember

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.560
place of rosted name which shows here in the home fall.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.730
This property name year where we assign our place of value to.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.370
So if that I'm extracting the place and I'm storing it in this place property here now in the template

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.160
office place motile I'll get rid of this comment as a title.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.030
I want to output the place title or place.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.230
Does of course have a title and then in the content you are free to create any content you want all

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.210
use to good old grid for days with a column here in the first row where I want to output the image.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.630
I'm just going to center this image.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.470
It is treated like a text to inline element in S S S right.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.320
So let's add the image here.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.930
Let's also bind this image to our image.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.210
You are all and below this.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.030
I'll add another row with the number of Cullinan side of course.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.040
Here I want to output my description in a paragraph just like this.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.710
So of putting all the data I have and below that I actually want to display this map excerpt so here

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.320
in this column I'm again going to use the Google Map component from this third party plug in.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.390
And I'm going to set the latitude of the expert on one to display which will be my place and their location

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.270
and their due let property and then the same forward you long and of course again place location in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:43.950
the LNG also set the soome to have a nice zoom factor back to the good old 16 I used all the time.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.900
And I also want to display a marker in this map so SBM Google Map Margarets now added.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:03.480
And on this marker as before I'm also going to set the latitude place location latitude and then also

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.910
the long it would and of course I can display a marker here because this will always be the place the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.870
user chose.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.680
We do have a place available.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.580
So if that I'm setting this and important don't forget India is as fall we need to set the bounds of

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.600
our Google map here or the height at least.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.660
So I'll set this to be 250 pixels used.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.570
And with that back and template we're having is maps snippet included.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.920
Now below it I'll add another row of some buttons in the first column I'll add another color and soon

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.700
I want to have a button which allows me to simply dismiss this modal.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.810
So this will be a normal ion button which should be block button color could be what let's stick to

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.830
the normal color.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.710
So then I'll simply add a click listener where I'll say on leave executing on leave Meffert and then

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.300
I'll add another column next to just cover that column where I'll have a number button also at the end

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.120
button directive of course but this button will now also be a block button but also received the danger

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.300
colored to be read.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.770
Because here I want to delete this place so I'll call on delete.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.230
Also give this Pat button some captions leave and delete.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.510
And with that the template has prepared the template of the detail page we should be able to see our

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.210
page.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.000
Our students are a detail place with that.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.100
Now already want to hook up those buttons at least to dismiss them all with them.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.310
So I'm going to be on leave button here and we need the View Controller to dismiss them all right.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.730
So let's quickly inject the view controller here like this.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.760
Make sure to imported from ionic angular

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.650
and with it and check that in on leave I can call this the controller dismissed to just dismiss the

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.310
modal and an on the lead.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:07.330
Well here I actually also want to call this on leave abse on leave to the this Mr. motile But before

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.070
doing so I want to reach out to my service and delete the place though.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.640
This is something I'll do in the next lecture.
