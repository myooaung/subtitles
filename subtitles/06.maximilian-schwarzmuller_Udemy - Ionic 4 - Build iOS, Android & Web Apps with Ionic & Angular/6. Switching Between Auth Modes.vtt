WEBVTT

00:02.230 --> 00:04.650
To toggle between logging in and sign up.

00:04.660 --> 00:10.810
We have to bind this button and also manage the state in which we are inside of our component.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.020
So are we in log in or are we in sign up mode.

00:14.020 --> 00:16.310
That is something we'll have to manage.

00:16.330 --> 00:26.100
First of all on that button here I will add a new click listener which will call or which will execute

00:26.490 --> 00:31.110
on switch off mode or whatever you want to name this.

00:31.140 --> 00:36.590
So we'll basically execute a method which we of course now have to add to the off page typescript file.

00:36.630 --> 00:42.630
Now on switch off mode should do just that it should switch our off indication mode and therefore I

00:42.630 --> 00:48.860
will add a new property here at the top which I will name is log in and you can name whatever you want.

00:48.910 --> 00:50.330
The devil let's say is true.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.800
So that we start in log in mode.

00:52.800 --> 01:02.100
And the idea then is that in the on switch off mode method here we said this is log in equal to what

01:02.100 --> 01:03.210
it's currently not.

01:03.210 --> 01:10.380
So we invert its value so it's not this log in and this will simply make sure that if it's currently

01:10.380 --> 01:14.770
it's true we set this to false if it currently is false we set it to true.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.710
That is all I'm doing here.

01:16.710 --> 01:22.500
Now back in the off page this is not able to execute on switch off mode.

01:22.500 --> 01:27.960
But of course I now want to reflect the current state and also use it when we submit the form.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.240
So first of all that's reflected here.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.580
Instead of saying switch to log in we want to output a dynamic value here and I will check the value

01:35.580 --> 01:42.490
of is log in and if that is true then we are in log in mode so we can switch to sign up mode.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.830
So I'll say switch to sign up then.

01:44.950 --> 01:48.870
Otherwise if law is logging is false then we are inside up mode.

01:48.870 --> 01:50.300
We can switch to log in mode.

01:50.340 --> 01:56.240
So here I'll say log in all the 1 output is in the eye and title up there.

01:56.370 --> 02:03.180
So instead of saying just authenticate I'll check if is log in is true and if it is I'll say log in

02:03.180 --> 02:10.960
here are our wise sign up to show in which mode we currently are.

02:10.970 --> 02:17.720
Now let's save that and let's see if it works as this application reloads.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.720
Here we see log in and we see a switch to sign up and if I press the button we see it switch to log

02:22.720 --> 02:22.960
in.

02:22.990 --> 02:24.670
And up there we see sign up.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.550
So that's the authentication for now.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.040
Let's now proceed to the new offer page here.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.310
And let's make sure that we can add a new offer.
