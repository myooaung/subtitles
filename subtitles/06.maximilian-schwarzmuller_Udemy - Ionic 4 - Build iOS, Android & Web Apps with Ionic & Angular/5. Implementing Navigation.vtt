00:02.510 --> 00:08.570
Let's start by being able to navigate to the ad blace page we're going to start on the home page of

00:08.570 --> 00:10.600
course and we can see those.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.910
And so I have I own serve already running.

00:13.070 --> 00:18.650
If we go to the running up this is our blank home page and I want to add a plus button in the top right

00:18.680 --> 00:23.870
corner which will navigate to this new place page through this app place page here to do this.

00:23.870 --> 00:28.700
I'll go to the template of the whole file of the home page and first of all I'm going to give this a

00:28.910 --> 00:30.480
different title but name it.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.470
Places to because this is what we're showing here.

00:33.470 --> 00:39.140
Now if that place I'm going to add my iron buttons block here to you where to put the should be placed

00:39.140 --> 00:44.960
in the neph bar gift is the position and to place it at the end of the nav bar and in there I'm going

00:44.960 --> 00:45.980
to add a new button.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.720
You'll learn this before with the button directive.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.510
And then with.

00:49.550 --> 00:56.960
I can only since only older I can and the NAF push directive to mix things up because i will all I want

00:56.960 --> 01:00.610
to do here is load this new page horridest at place page.

01:00.680 --> 01:07.450
So you or I will simply say at Les's page and does a property I will have to create before doing so

01:07.460 --> 01:12.390
I will add the button though I and I can with the name of ADD.

01:12.410 --> 01:14.030
This will be the place.

01:14.030 --> 01:20.430
Now if this lets at this place page property to our home dot TS file to our home component here and

01:20.430 --> 01:27.670
this should simply reference the at least page which Remember we already added year to the app module.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.020
Now we are importing it here in the home file.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.760
You can see home tortillas Faltu.

01:32.930 --> 01:38.210
So did were able to assign it to this property which you then again use year on this Neph push directive

01:38.210 --> 01:39.620
to go to that page.

01:39.830 --> 01:45.560
Well it doesn't place if we saved as we should already see that this works that this navigation works.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.740
But going back to the app letted reload here is a plus.

01:48.740 --> 01:51.420
Let's click on it and we're on the place page.

01:51.440 --> 01:58.520
So this works the next step is to work on this at least page to add a for there which will allow us

01:58.520 --> 02:04.220
to step by step create a page there before we then come to the most interesting part and implement those

02:04.220 --> 02:05.720
native device features.
