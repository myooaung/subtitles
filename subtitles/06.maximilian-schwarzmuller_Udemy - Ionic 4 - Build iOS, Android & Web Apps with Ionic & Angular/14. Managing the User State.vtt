00:02.170 --> 00:08.530
In the last lectures we successfully edit or a sign up and Silden pages and we get this to work as intended.

00:08.530 --> 00:15.230
Now I want to take this to the next level and I want to change the page with uing depending on the level

00:15.250 --> 00:17.980
we are locked in or logged out.

00:17.980 --> 00:23.980
Now changing the page we're viewing this sounds like a chop for Yapp component because this is where

00:23.980 --> 00:29.360
we set our route page right where we also have this menu which is able to change our route page.

00:29.650 --> 00:37.600
So in order to change our route pitch you're going to add a new code to the constructor here and this

00:37.600 --> 00:41.960
code will actually be firebase off again.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.010
But then we have to work on all staed.

00:45.100 --> 00:50.830
All states changed Meffert and this allows us to pass in a method which will be triggered when ever

00:50.890 --> 00:54.240
our offense occasion state changes in this app.

00:54.250 --> 01:00.870
This will then automatically give us the user Optik ever being NULL or undefined if we're not authenticated

01:00.880 --> 01:05.330
if it changed to an off indicated or the actual authenticated user.

01:05.380 --> 01:10.950
If we switched from FINUCAN to authenticated from an authentic at a to of indicated.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.060
So in this method I'm passing here as an argument to on Ofsted changed.

01:16.120 --> 01:22.480
We can write any code we want we execute whenever our of indication status does change here on want

01:22.480 --> 01:24.150
to check if user is set.

01:24.310 --> 01:27.000
And this will only be the case if we are of indicators.

01:27.070 --> 01:32.500
So I'm checking if I'm authenticated here in this case that we're authenticated.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.080
I want to do two things.

01:35.080 --> 01:42.670
One thing is I'll add a new method here which I'll name is authenticated which is false by default which

01:42.680 --> 01:45.880
I said true are used as property in a second.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.420
So here is authenticated is set to true.

01:49.420 --> 01:53.430
The second thing I want to do is I want to switch the root page.

01:53.560 --> 02:01.630
So here I'll use Neph and then set the route to navigate to a different page if we're authenticated

02:02.110 --> 02:06.340
I want to navigate to detax page here.

02:06.520 --> 02:11.420
So this taps page to this value stored in this property here.

02:11.950 --> 02:17.210
If we're not a Fendi to this nobody else case that the user object is undefined which means.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.180
Which means we switched to the end of an educated state.

02:20.410 --> 02:27.340
In this case I want to set is offene credit to false and I want to set my route page to another page

02:27.520 --> 02:31.900
let's say to design in page so navigate to the sign in page.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.490
In this case.

02:33.490 --> 02:38.410
So with that I have a listener in place listening for my authentication status which will hopefully

02:38.410 --> 02:40.090
show me the correct page.

02:40.090 --> 02:46.120
Now what do I need as of is authentic had a property for I'll use it in my template of the app component

02:46.510 --> 02:51.520
in the menu because I want to change where I want to conditionally show and hide those buttons.

02:51.520 --> 02:58.060
I should say so for example the recipe book button on place and she is on it because it only want you

02:58.060 --> 03:00.240
showed this button if we are vindicated.

03:00.430 --> 03:05.620
So NGF is authentic and it is the condition I want here because I don't want to show that but if we're

03:05.620 --> 03:11.080
not offending catered for the sign in button it's the opposite.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.090
I only want to show the button if we're not offending catered.

03:14.140 --> 03:20.880
So add an exclamation mark in front of is offended that the same is true for the sign up button.

03:21.220 --> 03:21.540
Whoops.

03:21.550 --> 03:22.480
Not here though.

03:23.180 --> 03:29.570
Here I only want to show this but never not have indicated the log out button though should be shown

03:29.600 --> 03:35.510
if we are offended and not if we're not if indicated So let's save this and let's see if this works

03:35.570 --> 03:37.310
as expected.

03:37.310 --> 03:40.050
Now keep in mind we already are.

03:40.100 --> 03:45.070
Vindicated because I did of indicate when I tested design in component to sign in page.

03:45.180 --> 03:51.470
Therefore I correct lasy recipe and log out here and I start on the Tapps page.

03:51.480 --> 03:56.270
Now we can switch to vindicate it because the log pattern is not working.

03:56.270 --> 04:02.540
So let's implement the log out button so that we can actually see a change between unauthenticated and

04:02.540 --> 04:03.580
of indicated state
