00:02.190 --> 00:03.660
This is it for this module.

00:03.660 --> 00:09.550
We covered a lot of different aspects of using forums and handling user input in ionic apps.

00:09.570 --> 00:15.870
You'll learn that both the template driven approach like here in the off page as well as the reactive

00:16.110 --> 00:23.340
approach as in the new offer page work and that you can use all the forum features and validation directives

00:23.370 --> 00:26.280
and techniques you already know from angular.

00:26.430 --> 00:35.100
You'll also learn about the special or some special new inputs it gives you like for example that nice

00:35.160 --> 00:37.750
ion daytime component here.

00:37.770 --> 00:44.160
You saw a bit how you can configure it and how you may validated which can be very useful and unnecessary

00:44.160 --> 00:44.660
to mention.

00:44.670 --> 00:51.930
But as always the docs are your friend for deep dives into all these components and also into our form

00:51.930 --> 00:57.600
control related components like checkboxes or toggles which we didn't cover here.

00:57.690 --> 01:03.660
With that we got a nice app and we're finally able to gather some data from our users data from the

01:03.660 --> 01:10.290
next module will now have a look at using that data to make sure we can actually create new play says

01:10.540 --> 01:16.740
edit them and so on before we then later also add functionality to enriched is with a custom picture

01:16.920 --> 01:20.660
with getting a location or picking a location on a map.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.820
And of course with sending all that data to a server.
