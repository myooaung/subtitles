00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.740
We already learn about those lifecycle books for pages.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.940
And those were methods we could implement on the page itself.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.760
And I wanted to would execute them whenever that page is presented whenever it is pages loaded.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.490
Now the new books are kind of different.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.940
These are not methods we're implementing on a page.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.280
Instead as shown before these are methods we can execute on a view control.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.430
For example on a modal which is loaded what.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.610
And then they are executed on certain points of time.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.120
For example we have you will enter hook.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.240
This is an observable observable you should be aware of what this is anglo to use them a lot and it

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.940
fires an event whenever this and whenever it is due.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.290
I should say it's about to become active.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.750
We also have did enter and it's obviously fired once it has become active.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.640
We have will leave and did leave.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.010
And it should be pretty clear that there was a fire just before and after the view was removed and we

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.500
all to have on will unload which is which is fired whenever it is destroyed.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.830
We also have on will dismiss an audit dismiss.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.600
And these are not observables.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.500
Instead these are functions which take a callback function as an argument which they execute well.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.160
Just before we were about to dismiss it or right after we did dismiss it
