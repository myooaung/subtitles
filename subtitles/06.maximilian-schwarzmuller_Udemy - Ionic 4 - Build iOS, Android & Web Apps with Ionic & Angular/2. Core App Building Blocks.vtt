Before we dive into the components which I've mentioned would be the heart of your Ionic application,

00:09.230 --> 00:14.990
let me go through the core building blocks of a typical Ionic app though and with that, I really mean

00:14.990 --> 00:22.380
an app that could run both on the web or on a native device wrapped into a native mobile app distributed

00:22.380 --> 00:24.080
through the app stores.

00:24.080 --> 00:31.850
And here again these UI components, these Ionic components are one of the most important or actually

00:31.850 --> 00:36.920
the most important building block you need in any Ionic app.

00:36.920 --> 00:43.190
Later in this course though, we'll also learn about things like theming and styling which basically is

00:43.220 --> 00:50.270
all about adjusting the look of these components because whilst they look beautiful out of the box, in

00:50.270 --> 00:57.740
your specific application, you will have your own style, your own corporate identity you want to show

00:57.740 --> 01:03.830
and you want to use and Ionic doesn't stop you from doing so, just because these components look good

01:04.010 --> 01:10.370
out of the box does not mean that you can't style them and we'll touch on this later in the course in a

01:10.370 --> 01:15.020
separate theming and styling module because it's so important.

01:15.020 --> 01:22.210
Now when we're building anything by the very trivial Ionic app, we'll also need to dive into navigation

01:22.560 --> 01:28.670
and that basically means that we want to switch between different pages of our app. Now a page here doesn't

01:28.700 --> 01:32.120
technically mean a new document fetched from a server,

01:32.120 --> 01:38.780
instead you typically build a so-called single page application where frameworks like Angular or Vue

01:38.900 --> 01:46.610
or libraries like React together with React Router drive the change of pages and the rendering of different

01:46.610 --> 01:50.860
parts of your app onto the screen and in mobile apps as well,

01:50.890 --> 01:57.170
there we also know that concept of tapping something, seeing a new page and then tapping the back button

01:57.170 --> 01:58.280
to go back.

01:58.280 --> 02:04.490
So this navigation process, both in the web and in a native app, that is also something we'll dive deeply

02:04.490 --> 02:06.290
into in this course.

02:06.350 --> 02:11.990
Now when we're building a bigger application, there will also be the point of time where we need to take

02:11.990 --> 02:17.780
care about state management and actually state management plays an important role even in tiny apps

02:17.810 --> 02:19.410
but there, it's very simple

02:19.490 --> 02:22.330
but the more complex your app gets, the harder

02:22.340 --> 02:25.400
state management becomes and state management,

02:25.400 --> 02:31.280
just in case you're not sure what this means, really refers to the management of data and information

02:31.580 --> 02:38.180
in your running app, something like is the user currently sending a request and should I show a spinner,

02:38.270 --> 02:44.360
that would be state or something like a list of loaded products, that would be another form of state.

02:44.360 --> 02:50.720
And this is also something where not Ionic directly but frameworks like Angular can help us and therefore

02:50.720 --> 02:54.580
we'll also dive into this later in the course.

02:54.650 --> 03:02.810
Now when we leave the web app world and we plan on publishing our Ionic app as a real native app through the

03:02.810 --> 03:09.740
apps stores, then we'll have it wrapped in this web view, in this real native app shell and we'll have

03:09.740 --> 03:15.710
this bridge to tap into native device features like a camera and that is another important building

03:15.710 --> 03:17.410
block of Ionic apps.

03:17.420 --> 03:23.240
Now admittedly, not so much of web apps, though you can tap into some native device features there as

03:23.240 --> 03:29.960
well as you will also learn in this course but mostly in native apps where you can actually access

03:29.990 --> 03:35.530
the entire bandwidth of native device features, something like face ID,

03:35.540 --> 03:42.590
touch ID or the location of the user and so on, all of that is possible and is made possible not by the

03:42.590 --> 03:49.760
Ionic component suite but by capacitor which is also developed by the Ionic team or alternatively, Cordova

03:49.790 --> 03:56.360
which is not developed by them but which is supported by Ionic. And last but not least, the CLI and

03:56.360 --> 03:57.260
that holds a port

03:57.260 --> 04:03.740
you'll also get for the build workflow and for the publishing workflow of your app, that also is part of

04:03.740 --> 04:07.670
the Ionic world and that is also what we'll have a look at later in this course.

04:07.670 --> 04:13.220
But for now in this module, we'll dive into these UI components because as I mentioned, no matter which

04:13.220 --> 04:19.010
app you're building and no matter how it looks or how complex it is and if it's just a web app or both

04:19.010 --> 04:23.140
a web app and a mobile app, you will use these components.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.590
So let's now dive into them.
