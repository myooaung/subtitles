00:02.270 --> 00:04.960
We worked quite a bit on the log in capabilities.

00:04.970 --> 00:08.060
It's now time to all the work on log out.

00:08.060 --> 00:13.750
Well we do have a log out method which if we click it actually all works takes us back there.

00:14.030 --> 00:16.730
But I want to do more than just take me back there.

00:16.730 --> 00:21.230
For example one thing that's not done right now is I'm not cleaning up my storage.

00:21.260 --> 00:28.310
I certainly should delete all the data in storage though otherwise if I reload this page I start in

00:28.310 --> 00:29.150
locked in mode.

00:29.690 --> 00:33.670
So we certainly want to do more when logging out and when to clear my data.

00:33.770 --> 00:37.700
So that's the first thing I'll add here.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.970
I have a store of data ends on methods.

00:40.370 --> 00:48.110
So here in logout I'll reach out to my plugins to the storage plugin and there we can use clear to clear

00:48.200 --> 00:52.240
all our storage but maybe we are storing our things which we don't want to lose.

00:52.370 --> 00:59.000
So we can use remove in that case pass on an object with the key we want to remove and that key of course

00:59.000 --> 01:01.580
here is off data in my case.

01:01.580 --> 01:09.210
So on that key field in that object that path to remove I ad off data warps as a string though.

01:09.260 --> 01:10.660
So now I should clear that.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.020
That's good.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.980
Now when everything I want to do is the way I log out is not really I want to do this anymore.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.900
My app component here in all logout I do navigate.

01:22.190 --> 01:28.260
This does work but maybe we'll log out due to our reasons and we soon will.

01:28.490 --> 01:36.830
Then I basically want to log out whenever my user changes and conveniently in the off service we are

01:36.830 --> 01:41.160
managing the user as a behavior subject so we can subscribe to that.

01:41.240 --> 01:50.320
And whenever the user becomes no well whenever data is the case I want to redirect therefore in the

01:50.320 --> 01:57.340
app component where I have my off service I will now implement the on an interface which is imported

01:57.340 --> 01:59.090
from at Angola core.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.640
So did I'm forced to add energy on it here and an NGO on it.

02:04.660 --> 02:13.800
I'll reach out to the office service and there to the user is authenticate it key or field where I can

02:13.800 --> 02:20.740
subscribe and I want to have a subscription here where I get that is off information and whenever that

02:20.740 --> 02:21.820
is false.

02:21.970 --> 02:26.710
And please be aware that in your if service user is authenticate it is built up on that user object

02:26.950 --> 02:27.930
so it will be false.

02:27.940 --> 02:37.240
Whenever we have no user whenever Data's false I want to navigate not down there but when ever the user

02:37.240 --> 02:42.760
authentication status changes for whichever reason that may be because there will be other ways of logging

02:42.760 --> 02:48.490
out than clicking that log out key at least soon there will be no doubt subscription should be cleaned

02:48.490 --> 02:48.760
up.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.770
Q Have a good code here.

02:50.860 --> 02:59.200
So let's add a private property off sub which is of type sub scripture in and subscription is imported

02:59.200 --> 03:00.190
from our ex.

03:00.190 --> 03:07.240
J.S. and then with that added here in enjoin in it all store my subscription.

03:07.270 --> 03:15.310
So off sub is equal to that subscription now to clean it up I'll import the on destroy interface which

03:15.310 --> 03:24.100
is imported from at Anglia core and that added here forces me to add the energy on the string method.

03:24.100 --> 03:35.960
So in there I check if we have our off sub and if we do that I'll call off sub unsubscribe and now we're

03:35.960 --> 03:37.870
redirecting whenever we log out.

03:37.910 --> 03:40.150
So the old logic certainly should work.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.910
Let's wait for it at

03:46.090 --> 03:50.350
log in here and log out.

03:50.350 --> 03:56.830
Here we are now one thing you might have noticed is of course that I started in the on offline ticketed

03:56.830 --> 03:58.820
mode even though it was authenticated.

03:59.010 --> 04:06.790
That is because I'm not having a check here where a check if is off is false in which case I want to

04:07.030 --> 04:08.320
navigate here.

04:08.350 --> 04:10.480
Now if I save that and this reloads

04:13.440 --> 04:20.370
and I do log in here and now reload this page.

04:20.370 --> 04:21.390
I still start here.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.570
Now why is that.

04:22.800 --> 04:28.160
No reason for that simply is that at the moment this kicks in.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.730
Before our off guard and you oughta log in logic there had a chance to complete this is simply faster

04:35.090 --> 04:41.800
and therefore it navigates me to off before my off guard could overrule that to work around that.

04:41.810 --> 04:44.000
Which options do we have.

04:44.000 --> 04:54.950
Well we could add a new property private properties of Pfizer's previous off state that is maybe false.

04:54.980 --> 04:55.580
Initially

04:58.490 --> 05:08.620
and then here a check if we're not authenticated and the previous off state is not equal to does curd

05:08.640 --> 05:09.220
off state.

05:09.220 --> 05:15.580
So to say so we have a new off state then I want to redirect so if we're not authenticated and previously

05:15.580 --> 05:16.780
we were authenticated.

05:16.780 --> 05:20.250
Basically else I'll not do anything.

05:20.250 --> 05:28.440
Now of course this also requires me to update the previous off state whenever I did authenticate so

05:28.440 --> 05:32.940
I'll set this to is off then after checking this.

05:32.970 --> 05:35.570
So now does reloads.

05:35.670 --> 05:40.350
And now if I log in again I'm forwarded.

05:40.380 --> 05:43.470
And if I reload this page now I do start here.

05:43.600 --> 05:51.560
And also if I reload again and again however we have a bug if I go to a detailed page here and then

05:51.560 --> 05:52.250
I log out.

05:52.310 --> 05:58.670
Then I get this error could not load place and click Okay I go back to that page even so that is not

05:58.670 --> 05:59.670
what I want.

06:00.500 --> 06:05.210
Problem here simply is that I get my user I.D. but I set up an ongoing subscription.

06:05.210 --> 06:09.130
And of course the user I.D. changes whenever I log out.

06:09.140 --> 06:14.810
So that was the back year I should take one as it did in other places too and for that of course you

06:14.810 --> 06:23.000
need to import take from our ex as operators and let me actually quickly search for user I.D. pipe here

06:23.000 --> 06:26.960
across my project to rule out that I have this issue anywhere else.

06:26.990 --> 06:30.170
Yeah here I would have a 2 and fetch bookings.

06:30.170 --> 06:34.940
Again this should only take the latest user I.D. and not set up an ongoing subscription.

06:34.970 --> 06:41.060
Otherwise you introduce blocks like this where you change something in the app and then it reloads and

06:41.060 --> 06:47.120
then all of a sudden the ongoing subscription which only should have fetched data once causes problems.

06:47.120 --> 06:53.030
Now if I go to the detail page here and I do log out this works properly of course.

06:53.030 --> 06:59.000
Maybe we want to reset that form here though so that is one other thing I'll do real quick in the off

06:59.000 --> 07:02.890
page and on submit.

07:02.890 --> 07:10.030
Once I'm done calling this authenticate I can reach out to my forum and call reset on that forum.

07:10.030 --> 07:17.490
That's just a minor thing of course but it ensures that now as it is reloads if I do log in here

07:20.580 --> 07:21.820
I do reset this.

07:21.960 --> 07:27.780
When I go back you can also see by the way that under application now the data really is cleared here

07:28.110 --> 07:29.650
but it is also set.

07:29.670 --> 07:35.040
If I do log in and they for now you'll see that data and hence now have a reload on the all first page

07:35.040 --> 07:35.690
for example.

07:35.700 --> 07:40.130
I start there again until I well log out again.

07:40.470 --> 07:45.070
So this not all seems to work but this is always when we manually log ourselves out.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.270
But what if the token actually expires.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.770
Because remember it's only valid for when our.
