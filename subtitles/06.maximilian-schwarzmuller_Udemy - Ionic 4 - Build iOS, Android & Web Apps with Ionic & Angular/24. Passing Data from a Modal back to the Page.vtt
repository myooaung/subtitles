00:02.050 --> 00:03.830
The app already looks pretty good.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.550
With the Smolan and so on.

00:05.660 --> 00:11.150
But now I want to be able to click on favorites here to remove this quote from my favorites.

00:11.260 --> 00:19.000
Now in order to do this we somehow need to pass some data back from the mall to to view beneath it.

00:19.040 --> 00:25.970
So to that favorite quote view this is the view very or the page where we opened the motile here through

00:26.420 --> 00:31.310
pre-sent and this will be the page we do wants to mold gets closed.

00:31.610 --> 00:37.910
So this also is the page where we need to kind of handle any data the model gives us back.

00:38.060 --> 00:43.280
But the first question is how do we pass some data back from the model.

00:43.280 --> 00:47.780
The answer is in the quote file on the dismiss method.

00:48.020 --> 00:54.570
Here we can pass an argument and this is any data we want to pass to the next few.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.570
Beneath that view so beneath the modal The View we were overlain.

00:59.900 --> 01:06.220
So here I want to pass some data in case we like the unfavorite button.

01:06.380 --> 01:13.100
Now in the template we can add a click listener to the unfavorite button and it could create a new method

01:13.310 --> 01:15.600
on unfavorite or something like this.

01:15.920 --> 01:23.420
But I can also use on close and let's say a pass through here to indicate that I also want to unfavorite

01:23.420 --> 01:24.220
this.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.450
So in the keyboard Dotty's file unclose currently takes no argument.

01:29.570 --> 01:33.370
But here you could say remove equals false.

01:33.470 --> 01:39.730
So I also provide the default value if no argument is passed as is the case with the normal close button.

01:39.770 --> 01:42.550
Here I don't pass an argument in such a case.

01:42.570 --> 01:49.250
I assume that you don't want to remove globe modal X using that quote that you don't want to remove

01:49.250 --> 01:50.060
that quote.

01:50.270 --> 01:54.720
Therefore I said removed falls but you are able to override it as we do here.

01:54.740 --> 02:02.090
If you pass an argument which is true in this case and then I simply pass on remove to the dismiss method.

02:02.150 --> 02:06.080
So now I ever pass false as a default or true.

02:06.110 --> 02:12.080
If you tell me to do that as you do with the unfavorite button and now in the favorite's Yes file I

02:12.080 --> 02:18.320
can handle that data and I know that if I get back to I want to unfavored the quote and if I get back

02:18.320 --> 02:19.120
false.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.400
Well I'm fine I don't want to unfavorite it.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.160
The question now is how do I listen to that data.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.750
How do I get this data.

02:27.950 --> 02:30.230
The answer is here in on view.

02:30.230 --> 02:37.900
Quote I present my model here and modal actually is just a view.

02:38.270 --> 02:44.430
Therefore I can execute all the methods I can execute on a view controller.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.470
I could dismiss the model from here but that of course would make no sense.

02:48.470 --> 02:53.710
I would Precentor and instantly dismiss it but I could for example create a time out which dismissed

02:53.730 --> 02:55.550
it after a couple of seconds.

02:55.910 --> 03:00.270
But I can also access one of the many lifecycle hooks kind of.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.370
Or I should better say events.

03:02.450 --> 03:08.740
Such a view controller can you omit for example on did dismiss on.

03:08.780 --> 03:18.710
Dismiss takes a function as an argument which is executed whenever this view is indeed dismissed.

03:18.710 --> 03:22.580
So here I know that this will also give me back some data.

03:22.580 --> 03:30.080
The remove argument I am passing here so I know that I will get this remove argument which is either

03:30.080 --> 03:31.870
true or false.

03:31.880 --> 03:37.420
I noted I get remove your and I know that will be a boolean of type Boolean.

03:37.730 --> 03:43.640
So I pass this as an argument or I only two will in the end pass it for me to dis callback function

03:43.850 --> 03:48.040
which gets executed whenever this Modal was dismissed.

03:48.050 --> 03:50.730
This is what on did dismissed does.

03:51.010 --> 03:59.330
Now before falling this to of some life let's dive deeper into those hooks we can listen for on view

03:59.330 --> 04:01.130
controls on views
