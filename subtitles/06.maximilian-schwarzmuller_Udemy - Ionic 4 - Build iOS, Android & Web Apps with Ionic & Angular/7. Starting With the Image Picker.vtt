00:02.310 --> 00:09.480
So we added the geo location the possibility for users to auto locates themselves and it's working quite

00:09.480 --> 00:15.990
nice and we also saw that it works on mobile devices which is of course the core idea behind as we tap

00:15.990 --> 00:18.260
into real native API features.

00:18.420 --> 00:22.800
And that's something I really want to highlight because it is important to understand and get right

00:23.490 --> 00:26.810
here when we're locating ourselves in the browser.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.280
We use a browser API.

00:28.290 --> 00:33.890
The geo location API is provided in the browser to when we're doing this on the native devices here

00:33.960 --> 00:36.930
we really tap into native device features.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.770
So under the hood we use that capacitor bridge.

00:39.780 --> 00:43.230
I was referring to earlier in this module on the slides.

00:43.230 --> 00:47.690
So this is now not using a browser feature here but really a native device feature.

00:47.910 --> 00:53.880
And this will become even clearer once we add the camera where once we try to access to camera.

00:53.880 --> 01:00.240
So for that let's dive into a new core plug in and that would be the camera plug in capacitor offers

01:00.240 --> 01:02.800
us now afforded.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.950
Camera plug in to use it.

01:04.990 --> 01:10.200
We first of all have to make sure that we again have all these permissions set up so let's dive into

01:10.200 --> 01:13.450
the Android folder and there in the Android manifest.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.680
And as we can see we should have these free permissions set.

01:17.770 --> 01:21.650
Now if we have a look here we have these external storage permissions.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.730
And regarding the camera we have that permission down there.

01:24.820 --> 01:27.730
So nothing needs to be changed on Android on it.

01:27.740 --> 01:34.510
ISIS if we go into the app app folder and then the info people list there we should set that end as

01:34.510 --> 01:42.530
camera usage description key and if we have a look at the info list file we have it here.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.850
So you can customize that message again.

01:44.860 --> 01:47.870
But other than that nothing needs to be changed here.

01:48.100 --> 01:54.490
Now in our app we need to change a lot though because right now we have no component that would allow

01:54.490 --> 01:56.160
us to pick an image.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.440
So it's time to create a new one.

01:58.540 --> 02:05.740
Let's say I use the iconic C alive or dead and run ionic generate components and then when I create

02:05.740 --> 02:11.610
that in my shared folder just as I created that location picker I'll created and shared pictures.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.900
And now that will be my image picker.

02:13.900 --> 02:19.020
So sitting next to that location picture component will be that image picker component.

02:19.460 --> 02:25.390
And therefore now if we reload this here we see that image picker file.

02:25.390 --> 02:29.440
Now how should that image picture work and look like.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.270
Well it's pretty similar to our location picker.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.980
I want to have a wrapping div.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.800
I eventually want to show a review.

02:37.810 --> 02:42.450
I want to have a button so I'll copy the code from there and move it in here.

02:42.490 --> 02:48.010
And yes of course therefore you could think about refactoring this into a shared component if you wanted

02:48.010 --> 02:48.610
to.

02:48.730 --> 02:53.000
Now I should not really need a spinner here so let's get rid of that.

02:53.580 --> 02:58.490
The image is definitely something I need though because I want to show a preview image.

02:58.800 --> 03:07.440
I will not check for any loading state though but I will check and it will use a selected image which

03:07.440 --> 03:10.630
eventually will be set as soon as we did choose an image.

03:10.860 --> 03:15.680
And here of course I will trigger not on pick location but on pick image.

03:15.690 --> 03:21.630
And of course the selected image property and the on pic image method here have to be added to this

03:21.630 --> 03:22.610
component.

03:22.710 --> 03:29.370
The class here will also just be image makes more sense to location image and other than that we're

03:29.370 --> 03:30.970
almost fine for that.

03:30.980 --> 03:36.660
I can on the button however I will use the camera I can instead of the map icon which should look nicer

03:36.900 --> 03:41.580
and for the text of course I'll use take picture.

03:41.610 --> 03:41.960
OK.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.300
So these are the first steps.

03:44.340 --> 03:53.520
Now let's move on to the typescript file and let's add that selected image property which should be

03:53.520 --> 03:57.920
a string here which we're referring to in our template.

03:58.020 --> 04:01.290
And of course let's add the on pic image method.

04:01.290 --> 04:09.510
So here I'll add on pic image now on pic image should open the device camera and should utilize the

04:09.520 --> 04:10.520
device camera.

04:10.520 --> 04:17.600
But I also want to provide a fallback for cases where we don't have a camera let's say a browser or

04:17.600 --> 04:20.180
a P.C. without a webcam or anything like that.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.900
There you don't have a camera and therefore you want to provide some fallback.
