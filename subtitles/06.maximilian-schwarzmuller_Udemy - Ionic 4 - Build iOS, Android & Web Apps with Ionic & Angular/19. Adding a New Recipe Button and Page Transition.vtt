00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.570
In the last lectures we worked a lot on a shopping list page here and that's looking pretty good.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.590
Now when I work on this recipe's page the first thing I want to do is I want to add a button to the

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.380
nav bar here which allows me to create a new recipe a blast button.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.140
So let's do this together now.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.110
In my application going to close the shopping list folder here in the pages folder and I'll go to the

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.500
recipes folder and there to the template I'm going to remove this unnecessary comment and give us a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.110
different type of title of recipes with a capital R at the beginning and then as mentioned a one to

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.170
add a button here which allows me to click it to open this new recipe page.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.700
This EDID recipe page here to be precise.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.590
We learned how to add buttons to the neph bar.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.940
Here's a refresher.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.240
You use iron buttons to organize them in the nav bar and then you can tell ionic to where to position

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.380
those buttons.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.150
I want to position them to the end.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.600
So on the end of this nav bar which will be all the way to the right in the end but this component I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.540
will then add the buttons a normal button element with the button directive placed on top of it and

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.290
this button will only hold and I can so give a d.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.710
I can only directive to make this I can look good and I'll add a click listener which will be on new

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.920
recipe which will fire this method inside of the button.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.640
I'll add I an icon element to just as I can.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.650
And as I can will be an icon which is simply a plus.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.340
That's all.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.950
This will give me those plus button Indy nav bar positioned at the end of the neph bar.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.360
Now of course I need to implement you on new recipe method now to be able to go to this page to this

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.910
new recipe page.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.360
So in the component body of the recipes page you're all get rid of all the unnecessary boilerplate.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.420
I prefer adding it myself if I need it and in on new recipe.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.250
We want to navigate to the added recipe page right now in order to do this.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.260
I need to re-aired the constructor here and inject the control or.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.770
Well there has been some times since we work with that right.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.560
But nav controller here like this and we have the neph controller added I can now access it and push

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.820
a new page on the stack of pages and keep in mind that the stack of pages for this tab for the recipes

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.520
tab.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.200
It will not match the average tab the shopping list tab.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.350
This is what you learn in the first app.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.380
There's two stack principle or multiple stack concept here where you can use taps to create multiple

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.650
sub stacks for navigation.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.730
So the page I want to push here is the added recipe page.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.750
Make sure to import it here.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.170
And yes you could of course all have used D-Nev. push directive but I like to mix it up and also bring

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.750
this nav controller back to the wind.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.660
So if this I am pushing a new page on the stack the editor recipe page I will also pass an argument

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.370
to your past some data.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.620
Now you could pass this in different ways.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.640
I will pass a javascript object where I said of one property demoed property and also I will set this

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.450
to new.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.040
I would set this to new because I'm going to use the same page that recipe page for both editing and

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.640
creating recipes.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.170
And since I do this I somehow need to determine if I loaded this page to create a new one or to edit

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.580
an existing recipe and I will do this by passing an object where I set the mode to well new.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.110
In this case or added in the editing case.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.420
Well with this we are able to go to this page.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.480
Let's see this an action by reloading the application in the browser and on the recipes tab you now

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.120
see the plus button which indeed takes us to the edit recipe page.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.810
Time to start working on this.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.660
And on the form they're using the reactive approach in the next lecture.
