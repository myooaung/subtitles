00:01.810 --> 00:04.660
The last try at a recipe service.

00:04.660 --> 00:06.520
Now I want to use it.

00:06.520 --> 00:11.800
So the added recipe types could file where I add new recipes in on submit.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.170
I want to add such a new recipe.

00:14.170 --> 00:19.630
Therefore here I need access to my service and that's why I need to inject it here in the constructor

00:20.140 --> 00:27.640
or store it in a property named recipe's service of course of type recipes service which needs to be

00:27.640 --> 00:30.050
imported at the top here.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.460
So make sure to add this import pointing to your service and where it doesn't check that and on submit.

00:36.520 --> 00:44.800
I can now access my recipes service and call add recipe to add a new recipe obviously and there I simply

00:44.800 --> 00:47.050
want to pass my foreign values.

00:47.260 --> 00:53.760
So to make this a bit easier I will store my value of form in you constant where I extract recipe for

00:53.830 --> 00:57.060
values of I don't have to type this all over again.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.070
And then I can simply extract value.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.410
Title well.

01:00.550 --> 01:01.290
Whoops.

01:02.160 --> 01:10.300
Value description value Diffee cultivate and value ingredients.

01:10.350 --> 01:16.950
These are the names I define for my control's title description difficulty and ingredients check to

01:16.950 --> 01:21.320
initialize for Mefford to confirm that this is the same for you.

01:21.480 --> 01:25.020
So here all those names are set up there.

01:25.020 --> 01:30.840
For now we can extract the values here and pass them to the recipe service.

01:30.850 --> 01:34.090
However this would not do the trick.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.150
What's wrong with this approach.

01:38.340 --> 01:44.280
It's really hard to spot but if you have a look at our template you'll see these are all the names we're

01:44.280 --> 01:45.420
using That's all fine.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.410
The form is synchronized and should work.

01:48.780 --> 01:55.680
But here for the array where we have the ingredients we leave for simplicity reasons only stored the

01:55.700 --> 01:57.830
name so we don't have an amount.

01:57.930 --> 02:03.480
However as we define an ingredient to have a name and abound with someone need to make sure that we

02:03.480 --> 02:05.500
also have such amount here.

02:05.880 --> 02:12.390
Therefore what we need to do is passing value ingredients like this won't work.

02:12.660 --> 02:16.080
Instead each year I will add a new.

02:16.080 --> 02:25.140
Or create a new helper constant ingredients which is an empty array initially and then I will check

02:25.200 --> 02:30.120
if my ingredients array does have any ingredients.

02:30.120 --> 02:34.470
So if that is greater than zero because if we have a recipe with out ingredients well then it's super

02:34.470 --> 02:38.320
simple than passing an empty array as ingredients is enough.

02:38.340 --> 02:45.540
However if we do have ingredients so if this is greater than zero then I will say ingredients and therefore

02:45.540 --> 02:48.790
it should not be a constant but a variable ingredients.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.660
Then it's my ingredients array.

02:52.800 --> 03:00.150
But here I will transform each element I do do as with the map Meffert javascript Meffert and the map

03:00.150 --> 03:06.140
method takes an argument which is a function which will be executed on each single item in this array.

03:06.420 --> 03:13.100
So in each name because this array will just hold an array of strings of names for the ingredients right.

03:13.350 --> 03:21.180
So it will run on each name here and I want to return an object which still has that name stored in

03:21.180 --> 03:26.220
the name property but which also has an amount property which is set to one by default.

03:26.640 --> 03:33.300
So this will simply transform the array of strings into an array of objects where each object has a

03:33.300 --> 03:40.200
name property where I store the original name and an amount property which is set to 1 and you can adjust

03:40.200 --> 03:41.390
it to your needs.

03:41.490 --> 03:48.720
But with this I'm making sure that I actually do have valid ingredients here so this ingredients array

03:48.720 --> 03:51.500
is now what I actually pass here.

03:51.510 --> 03:59.190
Again remember it's ever empty if we don't have any ingredient controls or this map array.

03:59.190 --> 04:03.670
And with this and now adding a recipe with the right values.

04:03.690 --> 04:11.470
Lastly I want to reset the form so recipe for reset as what I call here to empty all the fields.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.370
However does this kind of optional.

04:13.380 --> 04:19.890
Because it will destroy this view anyway because I want to go back to the root view and for this I will

04:19.890 --> 04:26.760
need D-Nev. controller selects and check the nav controller nav controller like this.

04:28.030 --> 04:34.240
And then I can call this naff commercial or pop to route to go back to the root page.

04:34.240 --> 04:40.420
So again calling reset is kind of optional because we will discard this view anyways.

04:40.840 --> 04:46.420
So with that we're going back to the root page we're adding this to our recipes service.

04:46.420 --> 04:53.200
We won't be able to see this but I can at least log my recipes when ever I add a new recipe to see if

04:53.200 --> 04:54.120
this works.

04:54.280 --> 05:00.670
So let's now save this and see if we are able to add new recipes and if they look the way they should

05:00.670 --> 05:01.350
look like.

05:01.570 --> 05:09.100
So if I click on the plaisir new recipes disabled let's add a schnitzel which is very tasty as we learned.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.080
And I can submit now because this is valid.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.640
We don't need to have ingredients that let's the difficulty.

05:14.760 --> 05:22.180
But I also want to add ingredient so let's add French fries here like this and.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.450
Another click on new recipe.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.450
We do see we do have a new item on this array.

05:27.930 --> 05:30.150
And this looks pretty good to me.

05:30.150 --> 05:33.890
We get our ingredient your description difficulty and the title.

05:34.050 --> 05:38.620
Of course we're not seeing it here in the list of recipes but this will change soon.

05:38.650 --> 05:45.720
Now it's all the addy's spaghetti again which are super tasty actually and are.

05:45.780 --> 05:50.890
Let's let's leave that to medium and I will add this without any ingredients so let's check to see you.

05:50.910 --> 05:55.260
Now we get two recipes here are spaghetti ingredients is an empty array.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.480
So this works as intended.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.370
Now let's all to work on this.

05:59.370 --> 06:05.530
Recipes page that we actually output what we see here on the right and the console on the page.
