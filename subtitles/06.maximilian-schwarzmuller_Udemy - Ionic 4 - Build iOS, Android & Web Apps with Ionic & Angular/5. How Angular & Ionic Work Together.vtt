00:02.210 --> 00:09.650
The @ionic/angular package in the end is a wrapper package around the Ionic components suite. So you can

00:09.650 --> 00:16.970
think of it as a package that takes all these Ionic components, these web components which can

00:16.970 --> 00:24.680
be used anywhere and wraps them into a separate Angular specific package or module, into this Angular

00:24.680 --> 00:28.150
module also which can only be used in the Angular app

00:28.400 --> 00:34.410
but this is done because it makes the usage of these components in Angular easier and actually also

00:34.430 --> 00:40.460
more efficient, especially when we later talk about things like the alert controller, modal controller,

00:40.610 --> 00:43.560
so these controller-like components we already had a look at.

00:44.150 --> 00:50.300
So in an Angular app, we use this @ionic/angular package which gives us the Ionic component suite but which

00:50.360 --> 00:57.630
acts as a so-called binding as it makes the usage of these components easier and kind of gives us a

00:57.650 --> 01:04.610
bridge to conveniently use them in a way we would use Angular components as well you could say. And the

01:04.610 --> 01:07.070
Ionic module here does just that,

01:07.100 --> 01:14.480
it basically includes all these web components and gives us that extra magic on top of it which will

01:14.480 --> 01:21.400
help us with for example these controllers. As always purely optional but still interesting, if you visit

01:21.410 --> 01:24.410
the official Ionic Github repository,

01:24.410 --> 01:27.500
I did show you the core folder in the last module,

01:27.500 --> 01:33.800
there you can find all these core web components. If you dive into the Angular folder here, you actually

01:33.800 --> 01:37.070
can see how that @ionic/angular package is setup

01:37.130 --> 01:44.360
and there, you will see that what it does here in this Ionic module for example is it takes all these

01:44.810 --> 01:49.850
core Ionic web components and simply declares them.

01:49.910 --> 01:57.230
So this is all added to declarations and it does so because this simply wraps the web components into

01:57.320 --> 02:04.190
Angular components, so that a) Angular doesn't complain about unknown elements being used in its templates

02:04.250 --> 02:11.600
because by default it only accepts Angular components and normal HTML elements and b) we get additional

02:12.080 --> 02:15.220
features as you will see throughout this course.

02:15.290 --> 02:21.470
So that's the idea behind the Ionic module and this is how the Angular project and Ionic are connected.

02:21.470 --> 02:28.250
It's a totally normal Angular project and we just add Ionic with this module, with a little bit of extra

02:28.250 --> 02:34.160
configuration in angular.json and therefore we can now start using the Ionic components and features

02:34.340 --> 02:36.810
in our normal Angular app.

02:36.980 --> 02:44.090
Now since it is a normal Angular app, if you open a terminal which you can do with view terminal or with

02:44.090 --> 02:50.810
the shortcut you see there, you can of course run ng serve to bring up the development server where you

02:50.810 --> 02:53.180
can preview this app and this would work.

02:53.180 --> 03:02.090
However I recommend Ionic serve but this behind the scenes will only use ng serve, it runs a special

03:02.090 --> 03:07.670
script but in the end that just does the same as ng serve you could say but it automatically also

03:07.670 --> 03:11.260
opens this in a new window, uses a specific port and so on.

03:11.360 --> 03:17.020
So I will use Ionic serve here but it will use ng serve behind the scenes basically.

03:17.330 --> 03:24.680
Here is the running project and as before, I'll open my developer tools here and preview this in the mobile

03:24.710 --> 03:32.090
view, so to see how it would look like roughly on a mobile device and I'll go with the Pixel 2 for now.

03:32.210 --> 03:39.920
So this is how we use Angular and Ionic or how we create an app and how the two frameworks or libraries

03:40.040 --> 03:41.100
work together,

03:41.210 --> 03:46.220
time to now get our hands dirty and build a simple dummy app here so that we can also see how we use

03:46.220 --> 03:50.660
the Ionic components and how we use these special controller components.
