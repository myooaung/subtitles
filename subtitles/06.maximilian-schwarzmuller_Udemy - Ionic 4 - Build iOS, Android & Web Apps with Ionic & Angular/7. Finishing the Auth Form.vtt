00:02.310 --> 00:08.580
For that in the off page component we're of course looking at on submit and they're first of all I'll

00:08.580 --> 00:15.050
check if form valid is false if this is false then I'll just return.

00:15.060 --> 00:16.580
I'm not sure how you made it here.

00:16.590 --> 00:21.870
Maybe you manually enabled the button through the developer tools but you certainly shouldn't get here

00:22.020 --> 00:25.500
so you can proceed on the form as invalid.

00:25.500 --> 00:32.640
If we make it past as if check then we know the form is valid and then we can extract the email by simply

00:32.640 --> 00:40.080
accessing forum value and then there will be an email property available because we named our form control

00:40.200 --> 00:42.590
email here with this name attribute.

00:42.590 --> 00:45.880
The same for a password because we named this password down there.

00:45.960 --> 00:53.700
We'll have a password property available to extract the password form value password here.

00:53.730 --> 01:02.220
Now I want to check if this is log in because if we are in log in mode then we later want to send a

01:02.220 --> 01:13.140
request to log in servers with our email and password and else we want to send a request to sign up

01:13.470 --> 01:16.260
servers for the moment of course.

01:16.260 --> 01:24.030
We do need her off that I will just console locked email and password we entered like that will add

01:24.300 --> 01:28.130
real authentication logic in the authentication module of this course though.

01:28.170 --> 01:35.610
No worries so back here let me open a console to see what I get US output and I'll add a e-mail address

01:35.610 --> 01:43.530
here and I'll add a password here and actually I see that the min length here is not really taken into

01:43.530 --> 01:44.040
account.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.220
That is not working as it should.

01:46.470 --> 01:52.890
And the reason for that is that I named the directive incorrectly here should be Min length with a lowercase

01:52.890 --> 01:54.550
L not with an opera case.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.510
My bad.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.970
So let's wait for that to reload and let's try that again.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.280
Email of course still works.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.870
And now you're a you see that's also still invalid.

02:05.040 --> 02:11.130
Until I entered all these six characters so five characters here six characters here.

02:11.190 --> 02:13.030
So that looks good.

02:13.030 --> 02:17.760
If I log in we see the output here and then we proceed.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.270
Perfect.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.500
So that's the off indication form for now.

02:20.550 --> 02:25.800
Let's proceed with the form that allows us to book an event.
