00:02.000 --> 00:05.980
As mentioned at the end of the last lecture a lot of things are still missing.

00:06.020 --> 00:13.450
But before for example working on the option or on the feature of being able to add ingredients I want

00:13.450 --> 00:15.780
to hook up this basic form here.

00:15.980 --> 00:22.700
And for this we need to create such a form with the reactive approach before doing so will quickly add

00:22.700 --> 00:27.000
a button to this form you're below the bar iron list here.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.420
And the button which allows me to submit this form it will of course all be of type I and button or

00:32.570 --> 00:34.330
get this directive I should say.

00:34.550 --> 00:42.650
And here I simply want to say mode recipe so that this also says new recipe or EDID recipe depending

00:42.650 --> 00:46.620
on which mode we loaded for this page here.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.910
I will also make this part of type block to have it span over the entire width.

00:50.930 --> 00:52.110
That's all for now.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.010
And with this that's now start working on the actual form.

00:56.090 --> 01:02.750
As mentioned before using the re-active approach therefore we need to create that programmatically here

01:02.750 --> 01:04.930
in our typescript file.

01:04.940 --> 01:10.100
Now it works exactly the same as in a normal Angra two application.

01:10.100 --> 01:15.950
Therefore if you feel confident doing this here's your challenge try creating this basic form on your

01:15.950 --> 01:16.410
own.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.210
You'll see which types of inputs we have here.

01:19.340 --> 01:25.730
So you try to create a forum on your own and hook it up to the age Jamail starting in a few seconds.

01:25.730 --> 01:27.050
We'll do this together.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.360
Were you successful.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.030
Let's do it together.

01:32.330 --> 01:38.480
I will create a new method here a private method which name initialize for him which is responsible

01:38.480 --> 01:41.710
for initializing the form looks like this.

01:41.940 --> 01:45.260
No Inish lies like this.

01:45.290 --> 01:46.160
Does looks better.

01:46.220 --> 01:54.530
Initialize a form and this method should use tools Englyshe gives us to create a basic form which we

01:54.530 --> 01:58.640
then can hook up to our template synchronize with our template.

01:58.640 --> 02:05.840
Now I want to store this form in a property of this class here of this component and named this property

02:05.900 --> 02:13.240
recipe form and will be of type form group as any form you create with the re-active approach is.

02:13.370 --> 02:18.010
Make sure to import form group from an angular foreigns.

02:18.550 --> 02:23.750
And of course it's uninitialized at the beginning because we're going to initialize it now together

02:24.020 --> 02:25.920
in this initialize for method.

02:26.870 --> 02:27.800
In here.

02:28.280 --> 02:34.210
I will assign something cutis recipe form and this something will be a new form group.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.620
We already edit this import.

02:36.620 --> 02:40.880
This will create a new form group but it's not valid like this.

02:40.940 --> 02:47.720
We need to pass an object as an argument angler to expect this and this object now really initializes

02:47.720 --> 02:48.690
our form.

02:48.980 --> 02:52.460
Now in this basic form we get three controls.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.160
We get a title control.

02:54.170 --> 02:56.380
I'm initializing this as a string here.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.440
But you could of course also limit the quotation marks.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.520
So we get a title control.

03:01.550 --> 03:04.250
So this is a new form control there for of course.

03:04.250 --> 03:10.220
Make sure to import foreign control from that angle of forms and I will go into the details of the form

03:10.220 --> 03:12.080
control in a second.

03:12.110 --> 03:17.420
We also have a description control description of this recipe.

03:17.510 --> 03:23.000
So let's add this form control to this object initializing our form group.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.740
And for now the last control we have we will add one later.

03:26.750 --> 03:32.390
Is the difficulty like this also a new form control.

03:32.390 --> 03:33.500
Pretty straightforward.

03:33.500 --> 03:41.240
So if we get a very very very basic form initialized though I want to find this habit for example I

03:41.240 --> 03:44.860
want to add default values and validators.

03:44.900 --> 03:50.120
Now for now I don't need a default value so I will simply pass null here.

03:50.270 --> 03:53.860
But I will set up validators for example the title here.

03:53.870 --> 04:00.620
I will use the required validator and make sure to not execute this method but to only pass a reference.

04:00.620 --> 04:05.250
Also you need to import validators from an angle of forms.

04:05.360 --> 04:12.260
Now for the description I will also set the initial value to null and then also use the required validator

04:12.260 --> 04:16.070
because I want to have a description of should not be empty.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.050
And for the difficulty.

04:19.320 --> 04:29.240
Well here I want to have a default value of let's say medium for now so that this medium partir is selected

04:29.250 --> 04:34.320
and of course the default value here has to be one value of the array of options we're using for the

04:34.320 --> 04:35.670
stropped down.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.820
Also this is required.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.420
So make sure to add validator squired here too.

04:41.520 --> 04:48.060
That's my basic set of I want to use no default value you know the default value and then medium all

04:48.480 --> 04:54.770
form controls being required with this form is created in the typescript code.

04:55.050 --> 04:57.270
Now that alone is not enough.

04:57.280 --> 05:02.910
Though we of course also need to hook it up or synchronize it with th Jim'll code.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.920
Let's do this in the next lecture.
