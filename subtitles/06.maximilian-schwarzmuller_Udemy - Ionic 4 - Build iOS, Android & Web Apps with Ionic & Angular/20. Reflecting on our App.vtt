00:01.860 --> 00:07.370
In the last lecture we started working on this detailed view for a single place and we're almost done

00:07.370 --> 00:08.910
we're able to do it.

00:08.930 --> 00:15.020
Well we haven't haven't tested it but we implemented that template and added methods to dismiss the

00:15.020 --> 00:16.040
modal.

00:16.040 --> 00:23.930
Now I also want to reach out to the service to remove a place for has to work out start in a service

00:24.170 --> 00:26.890
and at the delete place method.

00:26.990 --> 00:30.540
And here I need a way of identifying the place I want to delete.

00:30.680 --> 00:37.480
So I expect to get the index of that place and then after that I can simply access my places called

00:37.490 --> 00:43.760
splice and remove this element at this index and only this element.

00:43.970 --> 00:52.100
So if this I'm simply removing a place now the thing is with this I need to index and right now I don't

00:52.100 --> 00:53.550
have that index.

00:53.720 --> 01:00.400
So let's adjust our code to use that and I'll start in the home page Steimle file here and ends before.

01:00.470 --> 01:07.330
I also want to get my index of this page out of this place when looping through all the places and then

01:07.360 --> 01:11.630
all the past in next to the on open place Meffert.

01:11.650 --> 01:17.120
It's just called I though so pasters this index there and then you open place method I know and now

01:17.120 --> 01:22.870
not only get the place but I also get the index of this place which is a number.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.570
So let's all the past is indexed to the modal here in the index property maybe like this.

01:28.820 --> 01:35.420
And now in the detail here where I extract data when opening this I will simply store this index here.

01:35.420 --> 01:36.330
It's a number.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.340
So let's retrieve it in the constructor.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.570
I know that I'll get it in the NAF perms because I'm passing it.

01:41.570 --> 01:44.420
When opening the model with that I do have an index.

01:44.510 --> 01:53.630
And now here I can inject as places service the places service year of typeless a service of course

01:53.720 --> 01:57.120
which you need to import from the services folder.

01:57.260 --> 02:04.960
And with that added in your unbelieve method we can now reach out to replace a service and call delete

02:04.970 --> 02:13.240
place and the index off this place which again we all received as a parameter when this mole was opened.

02:13.460 --> 02:19.640
So let's save this and now I want to run it on my device again to see if this works if I can open this

02:19.640 --> 02:24.860
detail Moel if I can close it and I can close it and delete the place.

02:24.860 --> 02:26.270
So let's see it run on the device.

02:26.270 --> 02:27.270
One more time.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.560
We're still at home here.

02:29.780 --> 02:33.070
And you can of course pre-fall those fields if you don't want to type this.

02:33.070 --> 02:41.630
Each time you were testing this but to confirm Let's open the camera to take a new picture here good

02:41.630 --> 02:46.510
old picture and picture and picture of Deadlands at this place.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.100
Let's go back see it here.

02:48.110 --> 02:49.940
Let's tab on it.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.660
We opened the motile with the card here it looks good.

02:53.810 --> 02:56.340
We can leave it and the place is still there.

02:56.630 --> 02:58.670
We can open this again.

02:59.120 --> 03:06.270
And now deleted and it's still there we have to go somewhere else and go back to see it again.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.430
So this is not working as intended it's not updating the view.

03:09.430 --> 03:11.320
Besides that it's working great.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.510
So let's work on this bike or on this behavior.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.070
Next
