00:01.950 --> 00:08.280
Let's dive into daemonic to basics by creating a new ionic to project horridus I navigate it into a

00:08.280 --> 00:14.430
folder where I want to create this project and then I again use the Seelye with the start command to

00:14.430 --> 00:15.510
create a new project.

00:15.540 --> 00:24.530
Then the name of this project and I will simply name it ironic to basics and thereafter I will use Lanc.

00:24.540 --> 00:28.960
Now we didn't use that for this extra argument here with blank.

00:28.990 --> 00:34.500
I'm defining that I wouldn't use a blank template if you admitted you get this default starter template

00:34.500 --> 00:39.320
you saw before you could also use tabs to get an average tap's template.

00:39.390 --> 00:42.920
But again I will use blank to not have an empty application.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.790
It will have the default structure.

00:44.790 --> 00:48.850
The app component and so on but it won't have multiple pages.

00:48.930 --> 00:52.440
It won't have tabs and that is exactly what I want to start with.

00:52.470 --> 00:58.140
Also don't forget to add dash dash to create an eye on it to app with that hit enter.

00:58.230 --> 01:01.290
And this application will get created and I'll be back.

01:01.290 --> 01:07.320
Once it's done the project was created and I opened it again in web store and with that I'll open up

01:07.320 --> 01:07.940
a terminal.

01:07.980 --> 01:13.890
And this is a normal terminal window just integrated into my ID and I can run Iyonix serve in there

01:14.020 --> 01:20.940
to well start this application and to serve it again to compile and watch for any changes and then show

01:20.940 --> 01:22.330
it in the browser.

01:22.560 --> 01:29.680
So after this is finished I'll open it up again in the browser is device testing mode here.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.230
And this is the blank template.

01:31.230 --> 01:35.050
We start with as you can see it's not empty but it doesn't have any tabs.

01:35.130 --> 01:39.470
It's much leaner than the average template the starter template we used before.

01:39.900 --> 01:45.790
So now in the next texture I want to quickly walk you through all those folders and files or Fruita

01:45.810 --> 01:47.490
most important ones at least.

01:47.490 --> 01:48.030
And they're off there.

01:48.030 --> 01:54.840
I want to explain on how would such iconic application starts how it is connected to a normal angler

01:54.840 --> 01:55.710
to application
