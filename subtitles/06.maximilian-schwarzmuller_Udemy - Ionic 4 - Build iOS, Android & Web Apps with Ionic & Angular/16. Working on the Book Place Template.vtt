00:02.590 --> 00:10.000
I want to add dates and they have her let's bring in another Iron Road and I'll have my dates sit next

00:10.000 --> 00:12.580
to each other so I'll add size as I am free.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.760
Your offset stays at free and all.

00:15.760 --> 00:23.340
Give us a label of from and instead of ion input I use iron date time.

00:23.390 --> 00:27.560
Now I already mentioned that I would want to do them figured this in more detail than I did before it.

00:28.220 --> 00:33.810
Because if you checked your visual ionic framework docs would show we've done a couple of times both

00:33.810 --> 00:35.860
of course because they're really useful.

00:36.050 --> 00:42.080
If you go to your components reference there and you have a look at the eye and daytime you can read

00:42.080 --> 00:46.700
a lot about it and it's definitely worth reading that to make sure that you're using this component

00:46.700 --> 00:48.850
in exactly the way you want to use it.

00:48.890 --> 00:53.750
Here you can learn all about the different data formats it supports and how you can configured it and

00:53.750 --> 00:57.470
it will use some of these features in our component here.

00:58.160 --> 01:05.330
So on this I in daytime here I want to set my own display format with the display dash format attribute

01:05.330 --> 01:11.880
here and I want to start with the written month which is encoded with free capital Ms.

01:12.020 --> 01:15.460
And you can learn all about that formatting here in these stocks.

01:15.530 --> 01:16.650
So free capital Ms.

01:16.660 --> 01:22.490
Start with the month that is written out or that is actually written as text but then shortened.

01:22.490 --> 01:28.760
That is what we start with that I want to have the day two digits and then the full year with four digits.

01:28.760 --> 01:34.700
That's display format the display format is what's displayed when we're not having the picture opened

01:35.360 --> 01:37.750
for the picture we can set a separate format.

01:37.820 --> 01:44.540
So for that spinner that opens when we tap the picker and there I want to have a different format where

01:44.540 --> 01:47.330
we have a shorter year and that comes first.

01:47.330 --> 01:52.760
Then we have the month and then we have days and this is also there to showcase to you how you can configure

01:52.760 --> 01:54.230
that.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.000
Now I also want to set a mint and a maximum date and of course that now depends on the place we picked

02:00.240 --> 02:04.950
the minimum date should be the minimum date the place gives us.

02:04.980 --> 02:12.150
So if a place is available from January 1st to May the 30 first well then I want to make sure that the

02:12.150 --> 02:19.080
minimum date for this from picker is our minimum date of the offered place and the maximum date is the

02:19.080 --> 02:27.270
maximum date of the offered place and I'm not setting a maximum of December thirty first in 2025 if

02:27.270 --> 02:29.260
the place isn't available there.

02:29.310 --> 02:35.480
So we'll have two blind men and Max dynamically here.

02:35.640 --> 02:45.220
I'll come back to what we bind them later I'll also add and you model here and energy model right now

02:45.310 --> 02:51.880
is added like this but I will later changed his because we'll actually add a mode where we pre select

02:52.060 --> 02:57.610
dates if you chose random dates and that actually sheet and therefore we might actually initialize this

02:57.700 --> 03:00.280
with a default value here.

03:00.310 --> 03:04.300
Now of course we all see that date and that could be date from but you can choose whatever you want

03:04.650 --> 03:06.260
and it should be required.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.460
And yep that looks good to me.

03:10.040 --> 03:16.910
Of course I don't just need one such date I will copy that instead because I need a second date picker

03:17.240 --> 03:25.250
for the Q date and here we need no offset because it will set next to the from date the display format

03:25.280 --> 03:27.140
and the picture format is the same.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.160
Min and max now however are different or minutes different.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.030
Max is the same.

03:32.030 --> 03:39.920
It's the maximum date of the place we picked but min of course has to be the date we picked here because

03:39.920 --> 03:47.540
if I start at January the 10th then I can't pick a ending date that is before that date.

03:47.540 --> 03:52.860
So here I want to get access to my control and therefore I can add a local reference to the first day

03:52.870 --> 03:58.400
time which I'll name start date control and you can name it whatever you want it has set as equal to

03:58.400 --> 04:05.240
energy model to get access to this object angular creates behind the scenes and now we can use to start

04:05.240 --> 04:12.650
date control here to dynamically bind the mandate and I'll bind it to start date control thought value

04:12.980 --> 04:19.510
because the value I pick the first picker as at the starting date is the minimum date here at.

04:19.520 --> 04:25.880
Yes that's technically allows for one day states without any night in between.

04:25.910 --> 04:27.400
But I will keep it like this.

04:27.410 --> 04:33.200
Obviously you could add extra complexity and add some code in your types could file to calculate a new

04:33.200 --> 04:38.500
date which is the date picked in the first day time plus one day.

04:38.720 --> 04:45.080
But that is not really about ionic it's just a vanilla typescript javascript angular logic and therefore

04:45.080 --> 04:46.720
not what I want to focus on here.

04:46.790 --> 04:53.810
Instead a robber show you different features of different parts of ionic so we have that mean value

04:53.810 --> 04:56.320
bound will bind Max later.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.120
The name here should be date 2.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.230
And of course this is also required.

05:00.440 --> 05:05.650
Now some buttons would be nice and actually I have my book button here already.

05:05.660 --> 05:15.630
I'll just expand this to be a block style button to take to full with and I will added it my grid here

05:15.690 --> 05:20.460
into a row where I will use the same sizing as I do on the other rows.

05:20.580 --> 05:24.420
So size s and 6 offset s and free.

05:24.570 --> 05:28.360
I'll add that down here and now it is I in column here.

05:28.410 --> 05:33.620
We can add this button however I'll not call on book place up when I click anymore.

05:33.690 --> 05:35.800
Instead this button should submit the form.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.670
Therefore I'll set the type of this button to submit

05:43.700 --> 05:44.450
looks good to me.

05:45.020 --> 05:51.170
Now if a button with the form but this will not work because we're not binding min and max on our dates

05:51.170 --> 05:51.510
yet.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.420
So let's do that next and let's make sure that we generally finish up this book a place page.
