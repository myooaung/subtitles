00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.310
Let's continue our work on the favorite's page here it's ok.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.560
We have that Molen looks nice but there are a couple of things I want to change.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.750
I think it would be nice if we could kind of slide this item is currently not possible to reveal a delete

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.340
button so that we don't have to open the motile to unfavorite unfavored so that we can just slide over

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.360
and unframed favorite add like this.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.020
I ionic to support this.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.200
And I'm going to show you how we can implement this logic.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.920
Back in the editor.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.640
Any favorites HMO files so in the template we can actually implement such a sliding Ayane items that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.570
such a sliding item with a separate component.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.200
It's called an item sliding like this.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.940
Now this element here this component is ionic to component needs to wrap our eye an item.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.170
So it's placed inside of there.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.190
This has another implication.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.700
We now have to remove DNG for love from our eye an item element and instead place it on the item sliding

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.240
element here like this.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.750
So now we're repeating this item sliding element which wraps are an item.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.470
So with this we're halfway there I'll leave to Clix this listener on the item though because the item

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.530
still is the thing we actually see.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.870
But I can add some extra element now with that being wrapped by item sliding.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.400
I'll add it below the item and it is of type iron item options.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.190
Now I an item sliding an I item options are kind of tied together.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.140
They work together.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.950
You use them together and you especially used them together in conjunction with an item though that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.730
could also be a button with an item directive on it.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:02.370
What this does is item options allow us or items sliding allows us to slide this element and reveal

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.840
those options.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.590
Does this just how you use that combination.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.150
Sliding options and the element itself.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.490
Now inside of an item options you simply add a button with Type II and button because you want to have

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.560
a click clickable element on the thing we're revealing.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.260
And I'll give a color of danger to make it red.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.190
And on this button I think would be nice to have this trash like this when I can.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.920
So and I and I can and you can look up what the trash can.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.350
What the trash I can name is but I can also spoil the fun too.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.710
It's trash.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.160
And then I'll also have a delete text here just like this on the button.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.350
This will show such a delete button on the options we're able to reveal by sliding and that is how you

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.210
set this up to get the desired effect.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.310
Let's have a look at this and see it in action.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.930
And as always feel free to play around and see how it looks like if you use a different element like

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.560
age to element and instead of a button for example.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.630
Now with that let's go back to the application.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.580
Let's add a quote to our favorites and now you can see I'm not tapping I'm sliding doors and I'm revealing

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.450
this delete button here.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.700
Pretty nice huh.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.220
So that's awesome.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.570
Now of course this button doesn't do anything.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.590
So let's hook it up let's add a click listener to this button here.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.310
Go to split this over multiple lines to again make it easier to read.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.180
Let's add a color or a color excuse me let's add a click listener here and stat and here are what I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:57.350
call on remove from favorites and passed a quote as an argument on remove from favorites.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.320
Now it is a new method I'll need to add to my favorites here or do this year and unnoted I will receive

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:12.650
a quote as an argument and here I simply can copy the code I had here in my motile on this missed check

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.300
or callback I should say inside of this if block here so I'll copy this.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.340
And if are copying code that always is a good indicator that you can refectory your code.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.220
So instead of having the same code twice I can simply go to my modal on did dismiss callback and remove

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.970
this code which I now have and yabber method here and simply call this on remove form favorites and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.900
pass to quote as an argument.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.610
This will preserve you all function and functionality but make this code reusable and I need to reuse

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.550
it because I'm using it here for this button which I can reveal by sliding.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.540
So let's save this and see this in action and see if this but no actually works.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.700
If I go to the library favorite this quote go to back back to our favorites here revealed the button

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.790
click delete.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.060
It's gone.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.640
This is how easy I can delete the element.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.430
With this sliding effect here and of course you can add more and just delete buttons you can add any

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.110
but you want the different colors.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:27.500
With or without icons just like you can always style your buttons here but nicely fit into this optional

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.300
menu provided by IGN items options and items sliding
