WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:03.500
We achieved a lot.

00:03.500 --> 00:10.030
Now it's time to work on that detail page are a little bit and make our place bankable for that.

00:10.060 --> 00:12.350
Let's have a look at the place detail page.

00:12.370 --> 00:14.620
It's a very simple page thus far.

00:14.620 --> 00:18.250
Now I will start by having as a big image at the top.

00:18.250 --> 00:22.930
And for this I'll remove the padding up here and then add the ion image here.

00:22.930 --> 00:32.640
And I want to bind my image here to the place which I loaded which is stored here in the place property.

00:32.650 --> 00:42.090
So you're I will simply render place image you are L and I'll put that into a grid with a row and I

00:42.090 --> 00:43.360
and column.

00:43.370 --> 00:45.260
And I want to make sure that the size is okay.

00:45.270 --> 00:52.800
So for let's say smaller or bigger devices I'll give it as a size of six columns and I'll Offset of

00:52.890 --> 00:58.950
free to have a centered smaller column and in there I'll have that image below there.

00:58.950 --> 01:03.400
There will be a number row where we could output the description.

01:03.410 --> 01:13.730
And for this let's reuse the sizes we set up there and output in a paragraph that place this grep chin

01:14.770 --> 01:16.780
and of course you can add more here.

01:16.840 --> 01:24.850
I will now simply add that button so same sizing and also the text center utility attribute.

01:24.850 --> 01:34.870
And then that same button we had there before with that if this reloads here here's my place.

01:34.870 --> 01:39.630
Now that extra spacing around the image stems from the grid.

01:39.880 --> 01:46.710
You have to add no padding on it to remove that padding which it adds by default otherwise.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.030
Now it does reloads and you watch that you see it shrank.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.260
There still is more padding and that is coming from that column here.

01:53.590 --> 01:56.920
So on this first column you should know all that no padding.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.090
And now it is will reload again and you should have no padding around the image.

02:01.140 --> 02:04.210
Now also let's center this text.

02:04.210 --> 02:09.610
So here I will add text center and here a will add some extra padding again so that there is some spacing

02:09.610 --> 02:12.460
around that text looks better.

02:12.460 --> 02:20.110
Now that is the one thing purely an optional visual thing of course that helps for getting a nice app.

02:20.230 --> 02:25.680
But now let's work on that book button and let's make sure that we can actually book something ordered

02:25.680 --> 02:32.610
that something happens when I click that book key here and for that I'll work on the bookings service

02:32.640 --> 02:40.440
because right now in there we basically start with dummy booking that refers to one of our dummy places.

02:40.440 --> 02:47.610
Now bookings should of course be managed independent from the places obviously they will use place data

02:47.850 --> 02:51.840
but I will not initialize any bookings based on my places.

02:51.840 --> 02:58.080
Instead we should be able to create new ones and I will also use a subject here so that we can update

02:58.110 --> 03:01.040
our entire application as smart reactive way.

03:01.740 --> 03:09.360
So we'll create a new behavior subject here behavior subject is imported from our exchanges and I will

03:09.360 --> 03:15.090
initialize this with an empty array and the generic type here will be booking a rate.

03:15.090 --> 03:18.720
So what we previously has had as a type here.

03:18.720 --> 03:24.630
That means that when we get our bookings here I will return this underscore bookings as observable and

03:24.630 --> 03:27.860
therefore we'll have to adjust our components as well.

03:28.080 --> 03:36.680
And I need to add booking and also a cancel booking method here to cancel booking method will get these

03:36.720 --> 03:40.220
booking I.D. as an argument I can already say that.

03:40.590 --> 03:44.680
But I want to focus on the ADD booking method here first.

03:44.700 --> 03:50.940
Now how is a booking added if we have a look at the form we add first and the last name the number of

03:50.940 --> 03:54.470
guests and of course the duration for which you want to stay.

03:54.510 --> 04:00.090
And I also want to save the idea of the place we booked the title of the place and the image of the

04:00.090 --> 04:08.040
place title and image so did when we output the bookings we could output that data as well hence here

04:08.160 --> 04:17.750
I expect to get the place I.D. which should be a string the place title let's say and the place image

04:17.780 --> 04:23.660
because we should have that data in the part of our application where we start to booking otherwise

04:23.690 --> 04:27.800
we could also try to fetch it by place idea here of course that would work as well.

04:28.220 --> 04:36.080
Then I get my first name as a string and my last name as a string whips string my guest number as a

04:36.080 --> 04:43.100
number and to date from which will be a date and the date to which will be a date.

04:43.100 --> 04:43.290
OK.

04:43.370 --> 04:53.680
So that is all the data I have here now and at booking we can create a new booking here by calling new

04:54.190 --> 04:56.740
booking and using our booking model.

04:56.740 --> 04:59.940
However that model needs some adjustment some tweaking.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.900
We do expect to place ideas in there.

05:01.900 --> 05:07.660
We do expect the user I.D. in here which I will have to get from the off service the place title.

05:07.660 --> 05:15.920
Now I also want to get my place image in here we have the guest number but now I also want to get my

05:16.220 --> 05:24.680
first name and I also want to get my last name in here which are both strings and I.D. for the booking

05:24.680 --> 05:37.600
itself of course and the dates so booked from should be a date and booked two should be a date as well.

05:40.290 --> 05:42.920
This is now the updated booking model.

05:43.140 --> 05:46.740
Back in the booking service we have to pass all that data here.

05:46.830 --> 05:50.280
Now 40 ideas that will later be generated on the server.

05:50.280 --> 05:59.730
For now I will again use moth random and converges to a string to have a pseudo unique idea here.

05:59.730 --> 06:06.000
The place ideas received as an argument the same is true for the place title and image but not for the

06:06.000 --> 06:06.940
user I.D..

06:07.170 --> 06:12.060
The user ideas managed and off service though so we can simply inject that service.

06:12.060 --> 06:18.420
So let's add a constructor and of service here as an argument automatically bound to the off service

06:18.420 --> 06:19.550
property.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.210
Of course make sure to add the right import up there.

06:22.380 --> 06:30.750
And then here I can simply pass this off service user I.D. and after the user I.D. will need to place

06:30.750 --> 06:32.970
title which I get as an argument here.

06:33.030 --> 06:39.260
Same is true for the place image and also for First Name Last Name.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.190
Guest number date from and then here.

06:43.190 --> 06:44.870
Date 2.

06:44.990 --> 06:48.470
So this is now the new booking that is created.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.170
Goal is now to update our list of bookings.

06:52.180 --> 06:57.740
Add to that and then publish it to the world which of course is the same pattern we used in the place

06:57.740 --> 07:02.810
service and therefore you can definitely pass the video and implemented on your own if you feel like

07:02.810 --> 07:04.090
practicing this a bit.

07:06.550 --> 07:07.950
Were you successful.

07:08.170 --> 07:13.650
Now let's do it together and it's really just the same approach in general we're generating our new

07:13.650 --> 07:14.330
booking here.

07:15.050 --> 07:22.320
And if we have a look at the place service for ad place I also initialized my new place and then I got

07:22.320 --> 07:24.610
access to my existing places.

07:24.660 --> 07:31.140
Now that will be the bookings and I basically concatenated that new booking or new place and now it

07:31.140 --> 07:32.970
will be the new booking.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.470
So here I will have this

07:36.930 --> 07:43.320
bookings and this is a subscriber whole observable or subject.

07:43.950 --> 07:53.280
I will pipe in there and take only the lost value the latest one and for that you need to import take

07:55.120 --> 08:01.870
from our X J S slash operators with Tag imported.

08:01.910 --> 08:11.410
We don't just want to take it we all don't want to tap in there and get our bookings here to then call

08:11.410 --> 08:17.920
this underscore bookings next and admit our old bookings.

08:17.920 --> 08:25.980
Plus with the help of cat plus our new booking that should be all and that is exactly the same pattern

08:25.980 --> 08:30.020
I used in the places service now important of course.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.890
Just as in the places service I will return.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.100
This whole process.

08:34.140 --> 08:40.080
So this observable chain here so did in other parts of the application I can subscribe to it and show

08:40.080 --> 08:42.440
a loading spinner until we're done.

08:42.480 --> 08:49.260
And again we can introduce a delay here with the delay operator of 1 second delay operator

08:53.230 --> 09:01.120
needs to be imported here from our X J.S. operators and now we can simply fake that this takes a bit

09:01.120 --> 09:04.090
longer now.

09:04.090 --> 09:08.720
Adjustments are required in our bookings page because there we load all the bookings.

09:08.740 --> 09:13.990
Now this does not work like this anymore just as it didn't work like this with the places anymore.

09:13.990 --> 09:23.060
Instead here we want to subscribe we get our bookings here and then it will set this loaded bookings

09:23.120 --> 09:28.350
equal to the bookings I get here in my subscription and ask before we want to clear the subscription.

09:28.460 --> 09:36.440
So my booking sub which is of type subscription and subscription is imported from our express that subscription

09:36.440 --> 09:38.430
should be destroyed an NGO and destroy.

09:38.430 --> 09:45.830
So let's add on destroy as an interface here from at Angola core and then here at the bottom we add

09:45.950 --> 09:56.290
energy on destroy and called this bookings up unsubscribe like that and let's wrap it by a check to

09:56.290 --> 10:03.220
see if this set actually so that we don't try to call unsubscribe in the unlikely case that booking

10:03.220 --> 10:05.670
up somehow it should be on the find.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.650
So now we're initializing our bookings correctly again.

10:08.650 --> 10:12.230
That should work for now.

10:12.270 --> 10:18.570
What about creating a booking though right now of course what you can see is if I go to bookings does

10:18.570 --> 10:21.270
works without an error but also without a booking.

10:21.270 --> 10:28.570
What if I did enter all my data here and I now want to confirm my booking by clicking that book button.

10:28.780 --> 10:34.720
Remember that we open that from inside the place detail the component and then here indeed we present

10:34.780 --> 10:38.150
our action sheet which allows us to open a modal.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.790
So we make it into this method.

10:39.870 --> 10:40.740
And in there.

10:40.750 --> 10:49.420
Here we go into this then block once we basically submit the form in the model year we'll get our booking

10:49.420 --> 10:56.350
data hence it's in here and that confirm if block where I want to add a new booking.

10:56.350 --> 11:03.810
So let's inject our booking service then because that is a service that has the add booking method booking

11:05.290 --> 11:13.210
service which is of type booking service and booking service of course needs to be imported

11:16.910 --> 11:22.950
from the booking service file and whether it import that and inject it down there and confirm.

11:22.950 --> 11:31.180
BLOCK I can call this booking service at booking and now we need to pass a bunch of data now first forward

11:31.180 --> 11:37.420
the place we're working on and this is also the word in our place property.

11:37.430 --> 11:41.940
So in this place property we have here in the entire place detail page component.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.300
This one here.

11:43.360 --> 11:49.910
So in this place property we have of course all the place data like deed I.D. but all like the title

11:50.240 --> 11:51.080
and the image.

11:51.080 --> 11:58.040
So passing this shouldn't be any problem not a first name can be retrieved from their assault data and

11:58.040 --> 12:04.070
they are from the data field because Dad will hold the data we essentially pass back from inside the

12:04.070 --> 12:10.490
motel and if we have a quick look at our create booking page component which is our model and you end

12:11.120 --> 12:16.160
in the data we'll have that booking data field which in the end holds first name last name guest number

12:16.250 --> 12:18.930
and our dates.

12:18.930 --> 12:21.210
Now let me quickly change some things here.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.800
Guest numbers should be a number.

12:22.800 --> 12:27.030
So let's add a plus here and the dates should be date objects.

12:27.030 --> 12:31.330
So let me wrap them into didn't you date constructor here.

12:31.350 --> 12:38.170
So did we pass back the data in the correct format but will now be able to access this here under assault

12:38.250 --> 12:44.910
data Dot's data dot booking data because I named this key your booking data if you named it differently

12:44.970 --> 12:55.450
you access it differently so here we can now extract our data to make this a bit easier and confirm

12:55.480 --> 13:02.390
let's get our data which of course is retrieved from the assault data thought data and there is the

13:03.470 --> 13:10.380
booking data as I mentioned so it's the data constant which now holds all my data and there I'll have

13:10.380 --> 13:12.870
my first name in data.

13:12.870 --> 13:19.080
I'll also have my last name Whip's last name in data.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.610
All they have my guest number.

13:21.650 --> 13:26.070
And you can always check your create booking component to see how you named these keys there.

13:26.270 --> 13:29.910
The dates are named start date and end date for example.

13:29.930 --> 13:40.610
So here where I expect my date from this will be data start date and then it's data and date like this.

13:40.610 --> 13:44.460
So now I'm passing all that data to add booking.

13:44.600 --> 13:50.780
The one thing is of course that I added this extra layer and hence I want to show a little loading indicator

13:50.960 --> 13:59.550
until we're really done and they are for you know the game we inject our loading controller loading

13:59.560 --> 14:06.850
controller type loading controller from at ionic angular from which we already inject a bunch of stuff

14:06.850 --> 14:15.770
into displaced detail the component and then down there we essentially create that loading controller

14:15.770 --> 14:16.400
here.

14:16.400 --> 14:26.700
So this loading controller creates with a message of booking place for example.

14:26.910 --> 14:32.530
Here we get to then block with the loading element returned eventually and it's now inside of this then

14:32.530 --> 14:44.190
block that I want to execute all this code and then we can call loading element her ascent here and

14:44.330 --> 14:48.190
in add booking that is an observable so we can subscribe to this.

14:48.300 --> 14:55.980
Once we're done in there we can call loading element dismiss and this makes sure that we then remove

14:56.010 --> 14:57.290
the loading indicator.

14:57.510 --> 14:59.820
By the way since we now have the then block instead of all.

14:59.840 --> 15:05.450
Then block we could all the restructured is to return this promise here and add a number then blocking

15:05.490 --> 15:06.510
our main chain.

15:06.510 --> 15:11.160
But I would think this is a bit easier to to read right now and to understand how things are working

15:11.160 --> 15:16.100
together so let's save that and let's see if that works as it should.

15:16.440 --> 15:22.930
Our place detailed components or reload and I can click book here with a random date let's say now my

15:22.930 --> 15:26.610
name is Max Schwartz to shorten a.

15:26.730 --> 15:34.090
I have three guests I'll take that random date and I click book we're booking the place and did it work.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.600
We have a look at our bookings.

15:35.710 --> 15:36.520
Indeed.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.530
Here it is.

15:37.540 --> 15:38.850
Here is our booking.

15:38.890 --> 15:46.390
We made obviously one issue is that I just booked the place which was created by me because there actually

15:46.390 --> 15:48.300
are no booking places.

15:48.370 --> 15:55.180
Now there's something we can take care about but the general flow of adding a booking is working now

15:55.210 --> 16:01.390
let's make sure we can cancel one before we then have a look at ensuring that we only can click book

16:01.420 --> 16:03.130
on places that are booking all.
