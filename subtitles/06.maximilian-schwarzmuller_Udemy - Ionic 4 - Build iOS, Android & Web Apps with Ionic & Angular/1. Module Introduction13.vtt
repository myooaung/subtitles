00:02.110 --> 00:07.540
In the last course section we learn about the basics of I want to and that is super important.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.850
These are super important fundamentals.

00:09.850 --> 00:16.030
Now we're going to take those fundamentals and use them in this core section where we built our first

00:16.120 --> 00:21.280
application in the next electrum go to show you how this application will look like.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.290
But before doing that I want to give you a brief overview over what we're going to cover in this section.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.860
We will have an extensive look at the components.

00:29.870 --> 00:36.690
I own two ships with like modals alerts leasts cards and a lot more.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.520
You will learn how to use them.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.580
Where to find out more about them and how they actually work.

00:42.580 --> 00:48.280
We will also dive into navigation and not just stick to the basic navigation but also have a look at

00:48.280 --> 00:55.640
how taps work how we can implement a side menu and how that differs to the normal navigation.

00:55.660 --> 01:01.330
We will also have a look at how we can manage data as to how we can use angler's services in an ironic

01:01.600 --> 01:07.900
application and how that will then work and we will have a look at modals and alerts I already mentioned

01:07.900 --> 01:14.590
this but it's important because these are some key features how we can not only show them but also how

01:14.590 --> 01:20.340
we can really use them by passing data to them and fetching data we get from there.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.230
So these are all the things we're going to use.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.910
And with that let's get started and see what we're actually going to build before we start building

01:27.910 --> 01:28.370
it.
