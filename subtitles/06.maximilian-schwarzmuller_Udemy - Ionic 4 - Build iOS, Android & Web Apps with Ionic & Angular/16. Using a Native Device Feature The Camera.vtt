00:01.860 --> 00:05.800
With geolocation and so on implemented Let's turn to words to camera.

00:06.090 --> 00:13.050
I'm back in the documentation and here in the native section I'll scroll to the camera here to see how

00:13.050 --> 00:14.390
we should at this.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.850
Again to find out more about this plug in all its features how it works and so on.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.730
Have a look at this link you find here.

00:20.730 --> 00:21.690
Just get a link.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.250
And of course you can also scroll through this documentation to learn how it works.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.550
So let's now fetch this command here again.

00:28.570 --> 00:32.140
You run the command to add this plug in to our project.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.000
So I onic plug in at coord about plug in camera.

00:35.070 --> 00:39.320
We need to run this to again added an AB lead and set the right permissions.

00:39.330 --> 00:46.230
We have this in place we can now start using that camera now in the template of the airplane page.

00:46.380 --> 00:52.380
We see that we do have these open camera button which will execute the on take photo method.

00:52.410 --> 00:59.120
So let's implement on take a photo method in our typescript File here in our class and there.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.870
I want to access the camera.

01:00.870 --> 01:02.260
Now we didn't able to plug in.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.570
So the next step is to go to our import from ionic native.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.470
And besides importing geolocation I also want to import the camera.

01:10.830 --> 01:16.220
So with this enabled I can simply access it on the camera Optik we just import it.

01:16.350 --> 01:20.140
And here we do have the get picture method we can execute.

01:20.370 --> 01:22.450
This will open up our camera.

01:22.590 --> 01:29.050
Now here we can pass some configuration and let's find out which configuration we can set here.

01:29.490 --> 01:33.590
We can find out on the official documentation if we scroll down a bit here.

01:33.590 --> 01:39.930
You also can see how that works with the options we can set and the options we can set can be found

01:39.930 --> 01:40.340
here.

01:40.370 --> 01:45.660
To camera options as you can see there are quite a lot of options you can set like the quality you want

01:45.660 --> 01:48.220
to get DiVall the 50 as you can see in here.

01:48.330 --> 01:53.310
The destination type and that's an interesting one because here you can decide how the image should

01:53.310 --> 01:54.380
be stored.

01:54.390 --> 02:00.480
The default is that it stores it in some temporary storage and gives you the you are the path to that

02:00.480 --> 02:05.220
storage where it's stored it so that you can then take that and may be copied to another location.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.420
We will do that later.

02:06.560 --> 02:12.090
You could also return the image as a base 64 encoded string here with the Eurail for example.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.500
Sort of definitely Arsen different options of getting this image.

02:15.510 --> 02:20.370
I'll go with the default of letting the camera store it and some temporary path and giving me the location

02:20.370 --> 02:21.890
though and so on.

02:21.890 --> 02:24.780
You can also set the target width and height of that photo.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.720
We also have coating type which allows us to be fine.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.190
We want to get a cheap or B and she did default is cheap.

02:31.410 --> 02:36.480
And we do have the correct orientation here which allows us to use your interation we used when taking

02:36.480 --> 02:37.230
the photos today.

02:37.260 --> 02:40.110
We take a landscape photo we save it as landscape.

02:40.560 --> 02:47.190
So with this in place I will now go back to the camera here camera get picture and I want to set the

02:47.190 --> 02:48.230
encoding type.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.240
And I will simply set it to show how this works.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.350
I will stick to JPEG.

02:52.440 --> 02:59.460
But just again to show how it works all scepters by adding encoding type property and then by accessing

02:59.460 --> 03:00.450
the camera.

03:00.690 --> 03:06.880
And here we do have an encoding type Inam you could say where I can choose.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.720
Jay.

03:07.990 --> 03:09.880
So this again is default.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.490
We wouldn't have to edit but just to show you how you can set some of those apps options.

03:14.680 --> 03:20.130
Let's also try setting the correct orientation option here to try to see what this does.

03:20.260 --> 03:24.250
And you can again play around with the options and fine tune it to your needs.

03:24.550 --> 03:29.560
So if this were telling it how to take our picture of course we need to handle the picture and ask the

03:29.580 --> 03:30.490
geolocation.

03:30.490 --> 03:36.540
This is a promise where we have a den where we can add and then Meffert to handle the success case and

03:36.540 --> 03:41.940
the catch case to handle any errors and you should handle errors because of course you can get errors.

03:41.950 --> 03:47.710
For example again if you don't have the permissions to take the photo or as we build scene soon if you

03:47.710 --> 03:52.160
try to take this in the browser and you don't have a way of accessing a camera there.

03:52.240 --> 04:01.230
So if this I'm going to handle the first year and hearable simply will lock this error to the console

04:01.230 --> 04:08.850
for now that's all the work with the success case here we will get some image data and we can now use

04:08.850 --> 04:14.580
this image data and image data depends on what we chose as a destination type here.

04:14.640 --> 04:14.970
Right.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.280
So if this is your all pointing to our image or if it is the whole image encoded as a base 64 string.

04:21.300 --> 04:25.840
So this is basically depending on your destination type.

04:25.890 --> 04:33.510
For me it will be your LHD image so I'm going to lock this year Q and a half dozen someplace.

04:33.660 --> 04:40.350
Let's save this and see if it works in the browser so that our app reload and then I'm going to go there

04:40.350 --> 04:48.150
and click an open camera and we see that this doesn't work because coord of us not a whale because we

04:48.150 --> 04:52.040
did need to run this on a native device.

04:52.410 --> 04:55.140
So let's try it on a latest native device.

04:55.140 --> 04:59.930
Then we saw how to do this in the run and on a native device section.

04:59.970 --> 05:05.940
I'm going to exit out of I on serve here and I'm going to build it for us.

05:06.090 --> 05:13.480
We're running this I now open this build project an X killed I connected my iPhone here.

05:13.930 --> 05:17.230
Let's now run it on this iPhone by hitting the play button here.

05:17.230 --> 05:21.270
This will now build it and X code again and then ship it to my iPhone.

05:21.730 --> 05:27.320
And now I can't mirror my screen and keep the connection to execute code but I want to show you this

05:27.380 --> 05:28.230
lock here.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.580
So I decided to not mirror the screen for now.

05:30.580 --> 05:37.780
I did open the app there and now I will navigate to the open camera thing and know I'm asked if I'm

05:37.780 --> 05:40.430
allowing easy access to my camera.

05:40.630 --> 05:44.550
And I think OK if you press no here we will actually see the arrow case.

05:44.590 --> 05:50.250
I'll go for the success case and then I will try to take a picture and you may watch the console here.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.450
Click on use photo.

05:54.660 --> 05:58.430
And now this is D-Conn. So log with the path to the photo.

05:58.430 --> 06:04.440
I just took so that back in the application this is what I'm logging here.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.560
This image data that is what you're seeing down here.

06:08.580 --> 06:12.250
So this is the path of the image in this temporary folder.

06:12.750 --> 06:17.340
And in the temporary fall of course this is no place that we should store it forever because this will

06:17.340 --> 06:19.180
be cleaned up by the operating system.

06:19.190 --> 06:24.870
If space is running out or something like this but you can see that it worked that the image was safe

06:24.930 --> 06:25.750
there.

06:25.800 --> 06:34.320
Now the next step is to improve the UI a little bit and that also to show it or to add to our project

06:34.440 --> 06:40.230
to show it on our own or some place before we then work on moving this image to a more permanent place

06:40.350 --> 06:43.540
where we can store it forever or for a longer time at least.
