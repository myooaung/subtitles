00:02.310 --> 00:09.960
So this module is entirely optional. In this module, we'll dive into Angular and you'll get a brief refresher

00:09.960 --> 00:10.690
on Angular

00:10.740 --> 00:16.560
but if you already know Angular, if you took my complete guide or any other Angular course, you can absolutely

00:16.560 --> 00:18.060
skip this module,

00:18.150 --> 00:23.200
otherwise I'll do my best to bring us all on the same page by the end of this module.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.010
So what exactly is Angular?

00:25.020 --> 00:26.040
How does it work?

00:26.040 --> 00:27.240
How do we use it?

00:27.270 --> 00:29.910
So how will we use it throughout this course then?
