In the last lecture we recognize that somehow if we add multiple places where overwriting our images

00:09.420 --> 00:15.570
and this can be tough to spot but do you see what's going wrong in our ad place file where we store

00:15.570 --> 00:17.690
where we move our image file

00:20.460 --> 00:27.450
the thing which goes wrong here is that I call clean up to clean up my temporary storage which is nice

00:28.170 --> 00:33.050
but I don't replace my file name for the new file.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.430
Now this is one important implication.

00:36.410 --> 00:42.830
Since I clean up my temporary storage it always will start naming the files and whatever to file them

00:42.830 --> 00:44.540
is 0 0 1 at the end.

00:44.570 --> 00:48.050
Then I clean it up and the next time I use the camera I create the same file.

00:48.050 --> 00:53.870
Then I moved this file to the new storage directory and I keep DL filename and therefore I overwrite

00:54.050 --> 00:55.460
the existing file.

00:55.460 --> 00:59.870
This is why I always continuously keep overwriting my files.

00:59.870 --> 01:01.610
The solution of course is simple.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.150
We need to set a new filename here to make sure that this is not happening.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.720
So in the place types of files.

01:08.990 --> 01:18.180
Let's quickly create a new file name constant here and now how do we generate a fitting file name which

01:18.180 --> 01:24.040
is unique so we make sure that we're not somehow using a file name we use before.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.250
Well it's something which is unique to date.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.430
So let's quickly create a new date.

01:28.440 --> 01:33.360
Your Now here I want to get to UTC milliseconds to get a unique number.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.000
Basically that's going to be a very large number and important.

01:37.020 --> 01:42.840
I also add dot shape at the end because we're fetching this is a cherry pick remember debts to default

01:43.170 --> 01:45.480
and you also stated that here again.

01:45.510 --> 01:47.150
So we're getting a cheap hegg.

01:47.580 --> 01:52.010
Then I can use my new file name here and with this in place.

01:52.030 --> 01:59.220
Let's now run it on the device again with my own run iOS or Android and then the device flag make sure

01:59.220 --> 02:01.100
to remove your old app.

02:01.140 --> 02:06.420
Before doing this though arised are going to have a mixture of old and new data and that's not going

02:06.420 --> 02:08.160
to work out very well.

02:08.250 --> 02:14.830
So let's run it there and let's see if this now works as expected and gives us the behavior we want.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.740
I'd skip forward to spare you seeing me fill out this whole form.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.720
I took a photo.

02:20.730 --> 02:21.360
Here we see it.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.010
Let's add it here it is.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.650
Let me add another place.

02:25.650 --> 02:28.240
Now I'm quickly going to skip forward again.

02:29.070 --> 02:31.380
So I finished setting up this place to lead.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.130
Saved.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.680
And now we see a list of 2 item.

02:34.680 --> 02:40.170
Now let me kill the app like this and reopen it and see if this now works.

02:41.150 --> 02:41.830
That looks good.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.570
We got both places with the right pictures.

02:44.570 --> 02:51.050
We can open them to view the details and then I can delete the place of course and that's the number

02:51.050 --> 02:56.600
one just to check if this works as it should.

02:57.950 --> 03:03.680
Again let's select something on the map here and take another picture.

03:03.680 --> 03:09.560
Maybe here a little bit on the left use that photo looks good to me.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.260
Your address.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.380
Let's add this place to.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.150
So we added displays.

03:15.180 --> 03:18.420
Not you it's that one here to just to check play place.

03:18.660 --> 03:22.800
Let's delete this again and let's open it one more time to see if we still have the data.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.090
We had a second ago that looks all right.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.330
Now let's delete all of the data.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.570
And also delete discard here.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.060
Like this now and a stare and let's load it.

03:37.070 --> 03:43.570
One final time again I guess but now we should see no places so this now works as intended.

03:43.600 --> 03:50.030
Are now storing data in this local storage to persistent but we're also deleting it there if we're deleting

03:50.030 --> 03:53.920
an item and we're also storing our files in a better place.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.920
With that we learned a lot about the native features we can use how to use them for pseudos coord of

03:58.920 --> 04:04.640
a plug ins which are wrapped by ironic how we can then configure them and how we can work around with

04:04.640 --> 04:04.990
that
