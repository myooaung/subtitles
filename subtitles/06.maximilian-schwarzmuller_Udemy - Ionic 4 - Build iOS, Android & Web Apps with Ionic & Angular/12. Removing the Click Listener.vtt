00:03.320 --> 00:06.050
Now one important note about our map.

00:06.060 --> 00:07.990
Now we're making good progress.

00:08.030 --> 00:13.310
Next maps will be to use our address for all the places where we output our places.

00:13.310 --> 00:16.550
But before we do that let's have a look at the map mode again.

00:17.210 --> 00:21.790
And there we have one issue right now I'm setting up that listener here.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.510
And actually we never cleared and listener for clicks on the map when we dismissed him a little.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.530
It's not a huge problem here but it could introduce a memory leak.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.780
So we want to make sure we do clean this up.

00:32.800 --> 00:42.340
Let me add on destroy here to be forced to add the NGO on destroy method like this.

00:43.120 --> 00:49.300
And now with NGO and destroy added When I add my listener here does actually returns me a handle to

00:49.300 --> 00:58.330
that listener which I can stored in a property click listener for example would be a name I can choose.

00:58.350 --> 01:06.990
So this click listener is equal to map add listener disparate turns me a reference to the listener and

01:07.030 --> 01:09.180
then all NGO and destroy.

01:09.270 --> 01:17.990
We can now remove that listener with the help of that Google Maps object here so therefore let's store

01:18.000 --> 01:20.130
this in a global variable as well.

01:20.130 --> 01:27.010
Google maps of type any and in here I will set this Google map.

01:27.010 --> 01:32.620
So does property equal to Google Maps I get as an argument here and now here we can use both we can

01:32.620 --> 01:37.900
use this Google Maps or just google maps whatever you prefer but down there and then John destroy we

01:37.900 --> 01:49.470
can now use this Google Maps dot event remove listener and then this click listener and that this should

01:49.470 --> 01:54.150
ensure that when we dismiss the model and therefore clear the map we actually get rid of that click

01:54.150 --> 01:54.910
listener.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.010
So did we don't introduce a memory leak Yeah.

01:59.170 --> 02:00.350
And this looks good.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.970
It still works as before as you can tell.

02:04.180 --> 02:08.380
But now behind the scenes does a in a bit of a more optimal state.
