00:02.210 --> 00:07.650
Now these coordinates we now have in his object can be used just as we use them when we pick them on

00:07.650 --> 00:08.240
the map.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.850
Remember that there.

00:09.860 --> 00:11.010
I do nothing else.

00:11.060 --> 00:14.750
I just create that picked location here its pick location object.

00:14.750 --> 00:20.780
But there I also start with just latitude and longitude and then we call get address with our coordinates

00:21.080 --> 00:24.340
and get map image with our coordinates.

00:24.380 --> 00:30.770
So we just want to restructure to code such that we can call get ad resident get map image from both

00:31.040 --> 00:34.910
the scenario here where we fetched the coordinates automatically.

00:35.090 --> 00:39.980
And down here where we actually picked a location on the map.

00:40.090 --> 00:43.260
This is relatively straightforward to do of course.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.520
We can't just grab this code here.

00:45.580 --> 00:53.890
What we started with this is loading grab all the code up to year and cut it and put that into a separate

00:53.890 --> 01:04.420
method essentially which we could name create place or whatever you want to name it pasted code in there

01:06.110 --> 01:10.950
and now it is all the code we need to basically create our place.

01:10.950 --> 01:15.720
The one thing that is missing of course is we want to create our picked location object down there and

01:15.720 --> 01:24.100
create place now and not up there when we opened that map modal so there's code here where we pick the

01:24.100 --> 01:25.090
location.

01:25.090 --> 01:33.220
I will copy that and move it into the create place method here create place.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.690
Now I should get the coordinates.

01:34.690 --> 01:41.830
So here we should get a latitude which is a number and also of course the long etude which is a number

01:43.990 --> 01:51.790
and then instead of modal data data lat and modal data that long we just use the latitude and longitude

01:52.060 --> 01:57.430
arguments we're getting here in all the places where we access modal data dot data

02:01.490 --> 02:02.810
now that's the first step.

02:02.810 --> 02:08.060
We're now initializing the picked location with our pig lad along at you down there and then we're getting

02:08.060 --> 02:10.660
the address and we're getting the static image.

02:10.670 --> 02:13.830
And at the end we're still emitting our pick location.

02:14.060 --> 02:19.160
But of course we also have to call create place in the different places where we get coordinates.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.100
Now we're here when we picked a place on a map.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.870
I also just want to create a coordinates pair off type coordinates.

02:26.900 --> 02:31.010
So an object with a latitude and longitude.

02:31.010 --> 02:38.040
The lads use here of course is my mobile data dot data and there it was left.

02:38.090 --> 02:46.370
And then here of course long etude is modal data dot data dot LNG now with Dad we can call this create

02:46.370 --> 02:49.570
place and pass our coordinates there.

02:49.580 --> 02:55.550
Now we don't expect an object there of course we could check this or we simply pass them like this.

02:55.700 --> 03:00.680
And it's essentially exactly the same method call I want to make up here where I've fetched my location

03:00.710 --> 03:03.650
with the help of the geo location plug in.

03:03.650 --> 03:11.000
So with all of that we hopefully got code that allows us to fetch our location and then still get the

03:11.000 --> 03:18.670
address and dead static Mac preview based on that so let's go back to our application and let's go to

03:18.670 --> 03:21.850
that new offer page and if I click that button.

03:21.850 --> 03:28.630
Now first of all we get that activity here which I can cancel of course but if I don't cancel we can

03:28.630 --> 03:28.970
pick.

03:28.970 --> 03:30.610
Allocation on the map.

03:30.790 --> 03:33.150
This were exact before which looks good.

03:33.220 --> 03:43.440
Now let's try auto location and does this work yeah it actually does work but it takes some time now.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.980
The thing of course is that this was not super clear.

03:47.140 --> 03:55.030
So we probably want to set is loading to true here as well and set it to false whatever we're done.

03:55.030 --> 04:01.990
So over here or after we got an error and now it is should be even better user experience because with

04:02.050 --> 04:03.370
is loading set.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.790
Now if we actually pick a location by auto locating.

04:07.060 --> 04:10.120
Well that was too fast but we would have seen a spinner.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.470
Now let's give this a try.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.840
On the mobile devices as well.

04:13.870 --> 04:21.370
And for Dad again I'll run I on a capacitor run Android and then ionic capacitor run IAW to test it

04:21.370 --> 04:22.510
there.

04:22.510 --> 04:24.880
So here is the app loaded on both devices.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.940
Now let's give this a try on Android and I press select location there.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.260
We get that action sheet.

04:31.270 --> 04:38.830
And if I press auto locate I get to ask whether I want to grant this permission.

04:38.830 --> 04:45.270
Now if I press deny here I actually get my alert could not fetch location and they should have added

04:45.270 --> 04:46.010
a button there.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.600
Let's do that in a second.

04:47.590 --> 04:52.890
Therefore now I have to pick this on a map which of course still works.

04:52.890 --> 04:58.170
Now since I denied this the first time we would have to change does in our settings on this device here

05:00.460 --> 05:06.380
so let's open these quickly to get a second chance basically.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.870
So let's go into the settings here.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.600
They're under wraps and notifications.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.420
Let's go to our app here and under permissions.

05:14.560 --> 05:19.710
Let's make sure we switched this back so that we haven't made a decision yet.

05:20.240 --> 05:28.410
And now if we go back to our application and we tried it again I could ask again and I fell out is now.

05:28.420 --> 05:33.360
It does indeed locate me now side though the location shows here is not really my location.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.860
You get default locations here on the emulators.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.790
Let's try the same one when I guess if I click that I'm ask whoever I want allowed us.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.190
Now here I do allow it.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.220
And therefore indeed we get this location here.

05:46.540 --> 05:50.860
And here we also get a default location provided by Apple on the emulator.

05:50.860 --> 05:55.480
If you're running does on a real device you should be getting your real location.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.050
Perfect.

05:56.050 --> 06:02.730
So we saw this now on different devices and we see that it works and that our error alert all the works.

06:02.770 --> 06:07.090
One thing they're justice I want to add a button of course.

06:07.180 --> 06:14.980
So here where we create that alert let's add a OK button makes the alert a bit nicer than an alert without

06:14.980 --> 06:15.760
buttons I guess.
