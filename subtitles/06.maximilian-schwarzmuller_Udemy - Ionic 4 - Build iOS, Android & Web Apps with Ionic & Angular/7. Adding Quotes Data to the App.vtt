In the last lecture we created our tap's page.

00:04.820 --> 00:09.980
So we're now able to navigate between our favorites our library page and that is an important first

00:09.980 --> 00:11.020
step.

00:11.020 --> 00:16.870
Now in order to continue we need to get some quotes to actually display something here.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.130
And I prepared some quotes which you can find attach this lecture or not just some quotes.

00:22.220 --> 00:26.320
It's actually a file exporting an array of categories with quotes.

00:26.510 --> 00:31.890
So I'm going to add this file to my project and now there are different places where you could add.

00:32.150 --> 00:35.270
You could simply put it into your favorites folder.

00:35.330 --> 00:38.210
But actually we're going to access to quotes from multiple places.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.060
And yep.

00:39.200 --> 00:45.010
And since it's only a dummy data source Anyways I'm going to create a new folder in the source directory.

00:45.050 --> 00:48.940
I'm going to name the name of data in this state of folder here.

00:49.100 --> 00:55.200
I'm going to create a quote start to use file and then the file you can find attached to this letter.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.370
So you can simply copy the file into this data directory.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.850
Or of course copy the content into a newly created quotes tortillas file.

01:02.900 --> 01:09.470
So I'm doing the same I'm copying the content and it's basically just an array of javascript objects

01:09.470 --> 01:16.160
where each object represents a category and each category then has multiple quotes and a quote and then

01:16.160 --> 01:19.880
has an ID a unique ID that is across all categories.

01:19.940 --> 01:25.970
The person who well said does quote or made this code and then the quote itself.

01:26.180 --> 01:32.840
And the overarching category Optik also has this Ike and property which is all I can taken from the

01:32.870 --> 01:37.920
ionic to Iken library which well fits this category.

01:37.970 --> 01:44.210
Now with this a way Lebel we can start using that data in our favorites page here.

01:44.210 --> 01:46.050
Let's do this in the next lecture.
