00:02.210 --> 00:07.340
So the issue is that when we call fecche places to get the data we are getting the data.

00:07.640 --> 00:13.670
But we call I and you will enter and therefore you load places method before that method or before that

00:13.670 --> 00:17.150
data has returned from our service.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.650
Now there are a couple of ways we could solve this.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.460
I'll simply return this promise here.

00:22.930 --> 00:29.460
And indeed then method here I will simply return this places.

00:29.500 --> 00:35.380
So by doing this I can now go to my home fall an entry on it where I Kolditz I can then change.

00:35.440 --> 00:45.460
Then on this end here I know I will get my places an array of places like this and I can simply set

00:45.550 --> 00:49.350
this place equal to places to places I'm getting here.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.740
And that should not be inside of the parentheses.

00:52.780 --> 00:55.990
So let's fix this with this in place.

00:55.980 --> 00:59.700
This should now work as expected when I run it on device again.

00:59.710 --> 01:02.520
Now we should see that up on load up of the ep.

01:02.620 --> 01:10.830
We instantly see all our places and we don't have to go to another page and come back to see that.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.870
Let's see if that is actually true.

01:13.290 --> 01:22.290
So in the application time to add one more place your displays selected on the map.

01:22.360 --> 01:31.390
Open a camera and take this image here again use the photo of course edit go back.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.380
Does looks good.

01:33.330 --> 01:36.200
Let's now kill the application and reopen it.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.950
And let's now see it shut.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.500
Now Lotus automatically does looks pretty good.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.270
So let's open the D-Del. view.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.600
Looks good to me.

01:45.990 --> 01:51.150
Let's close it on let's add a number place here like.

01:51.160 --> 01:57.110
Well home to technically the same as home one I guess.

01:57.160 --> 02:05.920
So just my home it is and selected on the map to you and it's definitely somewhere else.

02:05.920 --> 02:11.430
So at least here open a camera and time for a brand new screen.

02:11.450 --> 02:15.140
Maybe a tiny bit to the right like this.

02:15.140 --> 02:20.150
So let's use that photo go down and at this place too.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.830
Well we see two places here.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.920
Time to get rid of the up again and reloaded one more time.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.760
So let's see this in action.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.190
Here we are.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.060
Well almost.

02:33.060 --> 02:40.280
It replaced the image of my first home with the other image it shows.

02:40.450 --> 02:44.260
So that does not look the way it should look.

02:45.020 --> 02:50.630
DB lasers were safe correctly but that the image part here I'm not liking dad.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.080
So let's look into this.
