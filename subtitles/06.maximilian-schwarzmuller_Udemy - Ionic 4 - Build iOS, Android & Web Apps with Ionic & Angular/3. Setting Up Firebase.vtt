00:02.540 --> 00:08.260
So we'll use Firebase in this course and therefore you can simply google for firebase to go to Firebase

00:08.260 --> 00:09.800
dot google dot com.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.930
And there you need a Google account to log in and go to the console.

00:13.940 --> 00:19.030
Now in this console you can create projects and we will create such a project.

00:19.100 --> 00:25.460
And that project that includes a database but also gives us that API to which we will communicate from

00:25.460 --> 00:27.220
inside our eye on a gap.

00:27.230 --> 00:34.060
Now you can choose any name you want I'll choose ionic angular corners here but you can choose any product

00:34.190 --> 00:34.910
you want.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.730
You can leave the outer default settings here if you want.

00:37.730 --> 00:43.070
You need to check both boxes here and there after you can click Create project and notice will set up

00:43.070 --> 00:45.110
a new firebase project for you.

00:45.110 --> 00:51.260
Now this is of course not a firebase course firebase has a lot of features and most features will not

00:51.260 --> 00:52.550
use in this course.

00:52.610 --> 00:57.970
You can of course dive into the firebase stocks if you want to do more with it will focus on the database.

00:58.040 --> 01:04.540
And later will also add the storage to store images to upload images and authentication.

01:04.570 --> 01:09.650
But for now the database will do so here in the database.

01:09.770 --> 01:15.550
You set up the database which firebase will use behind the scenes when you communicate with its the

01:15.550 --> 01:17.150
rest api.

01:17.150 --> 01:22.670
Now when you open this you first of all see the cloud fire store but we'll actually use the easier real

01:22.670 --> 01:23.810
time database here.

01:24.290 --> 01:30.290
So click on Create database here on real time database and start in test mode which basically gives

01:30.410 --> 01:35.480
everyone read and write access which is not what you want to use in production but which is perfect

01:35.480 --> 01:43.010
right now for testing and will make these rules stricter later once we add authentication and click

01:43.100 --> 01:50.090
enable here and this will now set up this far Bayes database and it automatically shows you do you are

01:50.100 --> 01:54.580
L here to which you have to send requests later to store data in that database.

01:54.620 --> 01:57.410
And that is that rest api is giving you.

01:57.410 --> 01:59.060
So first things first.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.860
We have this setup now in the next lecture.

02:01.880 --> 02:08.990
Let's actually use that you are L to store places we create here in the database.
