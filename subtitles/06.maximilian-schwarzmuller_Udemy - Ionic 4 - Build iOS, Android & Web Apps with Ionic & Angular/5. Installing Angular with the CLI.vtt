00:02.350 --> 00:04.300
So enough of the talking,

00:04.330 --> 00:07.440
let's now get started working with Angular

00:07.630 --> 00:14.470
and for that, I'll use a tool named the Angular CLI, the Angular command line interface that is which

00:14.470 --> 00:22.450
is simply a tool that makes the creation and management of Angular projects really simple because Angular

00:22.450 --> 00:30.340
as I mentioned is the framework but also the idea of using TypeScript and using a certain structure

00:30.490 --> 00:37.420
and because Angular apps therefore need to be compiled to Javascript and need to have all the code bundled

00:37.420 --> 00:45.910
together and optimized, because of that, there is a tool like this CLI that allows us to set up this

00:45.910 --> 00:52.960
project and the build process for this project which will do all the compilation and optimization for

00:52.960 --> 00:58.720
us so that we don't have to configure anything there. Because of that, a tool like the CLI exists because

00:58.720 --> 01:05.230
you will see it's really easy to use and we get a project where we can write the logic and the styling

01:05.230 --> 01:10.270
and the layout for our application in a very convenient and easy way

01:10.420 --> 01:17.260
and we still get all the behind the scenes magic of getting that one single page application with that

01:17.440 --> 01:19.530
one bundled code.

01:19.570 --> 01:24.550
Now you can get that CLI here by visiting 

01:24.580 --> 01:26.530
cli.angular.io

01:26.550 --> 01:32.470
and here you find all the installation steps and it's really just these steps which you need to run

01:32.680 --> 01:37.980
to have an up and running project and it's only this step what you need to install the CLI.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.960
So let's do that together now.

01:40.960 --> 01:46.040
You can install it by typing npm install -g @angular/cli

01:46.540 --> 01:53.350
and I added sudo here because I on a Mac and it might be the same for you if you are using the Mac or

01:53.350 --> 01:58.000
Linux need to add this to have the right permissions to execute this command.

01:58.030 --> 02:03.730
This depends a bit on your config but chances are high you need to add this on Mac and Linux to succeed,

02:03.940 --> 02:09.550
on Windows you will not need that, you can just hit enter and you might be prompted to enter your password

02:09.580 --> 02:10.570
then.

02:10.670 --> 02:17.650
Now once you entered the password, this downloads Angular and installs it. Now to run this command,

02:17.650 --> 02:24.880
you need one other tool and that is NodeJS and you can get that from nodejs.org. Now

02:24.930 --> 02:30.490
NodeJS is a server-side Javascript runtime you could say, it allows you to write server-side code

02:30.640 --> 02:38.080
with Javascript and that's not what we'll do in this course. But NodeJS when you install it, also gives

02:38.080 --> 02:45.280
you its Node Package Manager and that is a tool which you historically used for managing dependencies

02:45.280 --> 02:47.000
of NodeJS projects

02:47.140 --> 02:54.400
but in modern Javascript development and that encloses things like developing mobile apps with Javascript

02:54.460 --> 03:01.300
or of course web apps with Javascript with frameworks like Angular, you use this npm tool, this package

03:01.300 --> 03:07.690
manager to install the dependencies for such projects as well and the Angular CLI is simply a tool

03:07.690 --> 03:09.940
you can install through npm.

03:09.940 --> 03:16.030
So go to nodejs.org and download the latest version of NodeJS, run through the installer

03:16.030 --> 03:17.310
this will give you

03:17.410 --> 03:23.290
and once you finished the installer which is a straight forward installer without any special things

03:23.290 --> 03:24.210
to consider,

03:24.280 --> 03:29.830
once you've finished the installation process, you will be able to run this npm command because that uses

03:29.840 --> 03:33.520
this npm tool which is installed together with NodeJS.

03:33.790 --> 03:40.130
Now with the installation finished, we can use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project

03:41.360 --> 03:46.760
and for that, you simply navigate into a folder where you want to create that project with the help of

03:46.760 --> 03:48.780
the cd command in your terminal,

03:49.040 --> 03:56.420
I already did this and then you run ng new and I'll name it ng-refresher but you can name

03:56.420 --> 04:01.460
it however you want of course, this will be my project name, ng new is required and this uses this

04:01.460 --> 04:03.250
CLI tool we installed.

04:03.560 --> 04:09.740
Now you are asked if you want to add Angular routing and I will add N for no here and how you would

04:09.740 --> 04:15.680
like to write your styles and I will stick to the default which is CSS. And now this will generate

04:15.680 --> 04:22.220
a new folder in the path you navigated to in your terminal and it will set up a basic Angular project

04:22.220 --> 04:22.790
there

04:22.970 --> 04:27.710
and whilst this is happening, we can now take care about using a fitting editor.
