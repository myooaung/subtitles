00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.070
End the last core sections with a closer look at components and on how to run our application on the

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.040
real device.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.300
Now with those important sections out of the way let's take a closer look at a real application again

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.880
in this core section we're going to build an app in the next lecture you're going to see what specifically

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.150
we're going to build.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.810
But now we want to highlight the core features of this app will use even more of both and component

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.510
so that you see more examples of components you can use and how to use them.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.680
But the specific focus of the section will then lay on handling user input and using forums.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.850
The template driven already reactive approach supported by Tingler to both Barack and I want him to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.720
as he will learn.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.600
And this is what we will have a closer look at in this section
