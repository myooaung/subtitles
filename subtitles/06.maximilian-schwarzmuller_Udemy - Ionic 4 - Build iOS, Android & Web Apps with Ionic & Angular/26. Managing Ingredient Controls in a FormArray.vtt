00:01.760 --> 00:09.750
And The Last Lecture we started working on this alert which should allow the user to enter a new ingredient

00:10.330 --> 00:11.720
and it's not finished.

00:11.860 --> 00:19.920
But in order to be able to continue I now need to add these ingredients for an array to my forum.

00:20.320 --> 00:29.500
So to do this I will go to my initialize for Meffert and add a fourth control which I'll name the ingredients

00:29.590 --> 00:35.740
because it will store an array of ingredients and therefore this is not a form control but as a form

00:35.740 --> 00:40.330
array and you need to import form array from an angle of Foreigns.

00:40.330 --> 00:44.820
Now for an array simply holds an array of form controls.

00:45.130 --> 00:52.980
Initially I will pass an empty array here so that we start of with no form controls added.

00:52.990 --> 00:57.270
Now with this I added my ingredients array though it is empty.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.490
Now of course we need to synchronize a two hour template.

01:00.700 --> 01:08.290
So in the template of the added recipe page I want to go to my eye an item here which should be replicated

01:08.290 --> 01:16.390
for all my newly added controls for all my ingredients and it will use energy for a year to loop through

01:16.390 --> 01:18.070
my Ingredion controls.

01:18.070 --> 01:25.210
I will store them in a variable named IGY control the individual control.

01:25.210 --> 01:34.540
So this now loops from my recipe for him and there I will get my ingredients control remember ingredients

01:34.560 --> 01:39.050
is the name I chose for disarrayed and here specifically.

01:39.090 --> 01:45.850
I then need to loop through all the controls in this control because to control its self-esteem array.

01:45.930 --> 01:50.300
And this does have a couple of different properties like invalid and so on.

01:50.430 --> 01:56.200
But it also has a controlled velt value or property which stores the actual controls.

01:56.220 --> 02:02.270
So now looping through all those controls in a store the individual control in this IGY control variable.

02:02.330 --> 02:09.630
Splitting this romantic lines here and with this I'm replicating my eye an item here to have my different

02:09.720 --> 02:10.920
array items right.

02:12.270 --> 02:19.950
I also need the index of the individual array items of individual control and I will store it in a variable

02:19.950 --> 02:23.120
named I.

02:23.130 --> 02:28.200
You can of course choose a different name here and this simply gives me the index of this control in

02:28.200 --> 02:29.830
this array of controls.

02:30.270 --> 02:32.210
That's the I-N item.

02:32.490 --> 02:40.050
Now that is nice and this allows me now to go to my iron list which in the end will hold all my controls

02:40.680 --> 02:44.820
and assign the form array name.

02:45.150 --> 02:51.020
Directive here and here I will point to the ingredients control because this is my Formerie and this

02:51.020 --> 02:53.270
is how form arrays work in Angola too.

02:53.390 --> 02:59.460
You have a parent element which you synchronize with your form array and then you have the individual

02:59.460 --> 03:02.580
elements inside of there which represent your controls.

03:02.730 --> 03:06.460
Specifically the IGN input here will be my individual control of course.

03:06.540 --> 03:13.770
So on this input I now use form control name and which name does the individual input in such an array

03:13.770 --> 03:15.270
of controls health.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.120
It's of course the index.

03:17.220 --> 03:22.760
So we can point this by using square brackets since we're now not passing a string but instead.

03:22.790 --> 03:23.180
I.e..

03:23.190 --> 03:28.710
Which of course is this variable storing the index of decontrol And with that I'm synchronizing this

03:28.710 --> 03:35.500
input which is of course replicated since we replicate the item with the control.

03:35.520 --> 03:41.760
I'm currently at in this loop and the whole array is synchronized with this list which of course contains

03:41.760 --> 03:44.460
the individual inputs with that form.

03:44.460 --> 03:48.440
Array is synchronized with my template.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.260
I can also add floating here to the label to get this floating style.

03:53.490 --> 04:00.330
With that that's all set up I can now go back to the recipe page and continue working on this new ingredient

04:00.330 --> 04:05.310
alert where I want to add a new control to this array of controls.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.710
If we click the button on the alert.

04:07.950 --> 04:10.580
Let's continue working on this in the next lecture.
