WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:03.970
We're done for this course.

00:03.970 --> 00:09.280
You learned a lot about ionic and how do you build exciting applications with the many features it offers

00:09.280 --> 00:09.850
you.

00:09.850 --> 00:16.270
Most importantly we built a web app and still we can run this as a native mobile app.

00:16.270 --> 00:19.520
And of course we can all deploy it as such an app they offer.

00:19.570 --> 00:22.620
And that's exactly what we'll do in this module.

00:22.700 --> 00:29.260
All first of all start by adding custom icons and a splash screen for our mobile apps so that you can

00:29.260 --> 00:32.340
customize that and I'll show you how that would work.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.410
Once we're done with Dad we can build the app and you will learn how to deploy it as an Android app.

00:38.560 --> 00:45.820
So to the Google Play store how to deploy it as an ISIS app to the Apple App Store and how to deploy

00:45.820 --> 00:52.600
it as a progressive web app or as a web app in general because that of course is also something you

00:52.600 --> 00:53.470
can do.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.350
We test it does app in the browser all the time.

00:56.350 --> 01:01.320
Well obviously we did so because it is a web app and hence we can deploy it as such.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.970
And in this module we'll cover all these cases.
