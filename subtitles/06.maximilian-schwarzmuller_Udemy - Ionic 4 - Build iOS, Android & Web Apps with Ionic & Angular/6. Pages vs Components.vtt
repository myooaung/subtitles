00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.530
In a normal angler 2 application we use components to build that app.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.930
We have a root component.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.010
The app component with its template.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.770
And then this template we would typically have some HDMI code and possibly selectors of abro components

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.980
or we would use the anguage you router to render different components depending on which are out we

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.480
are on.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.670
This does not work this way.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.530
In an ironic too where we can still place selectors of components there in the end I N.F. is just a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:43.130
component but the pages we see here like these starting blank page here are not rendered by placing

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.740
a selector off it anywhere because this page the page with the page home selector is not placed here

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.460
you don't see the page hobo's electorate in the template of a root component.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.400
Instead ironic to you has a different way of navigating between your pages.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.620
This of course brings us to an important question.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.820
What is the page you can think of a page of what you see on the whole screen so a page takes up your

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.440
full screen.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.040
It is a normal thing or two component and this is super important to understand.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.990
It is a normal component we call it page because it takes up the full screen and it is loaded for ironic

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.750
to his navigation concept you could say to which I will come back in the next lecture a component on

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.900
the average end is for one the whole page as I just said a page is a component but could also be a part

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.720
of a page.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.410
We are still able to include normal angler to components on a page.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.920
So not every component is a page but every page is a component and to clear up the confusion lets see

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.250
how navigation works in Iyonix too in the next video
