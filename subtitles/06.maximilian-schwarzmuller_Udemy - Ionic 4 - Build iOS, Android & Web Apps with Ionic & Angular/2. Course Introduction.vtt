Well come on board of this course I'm really happy to have you as a student in this course.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.890
This course is about avionic to a framework which builds up on angular to framework which of course

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.410
allows you to build awesome web applications to then take this angle or to knowledge to build awesome

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.130
native applications applications running natively on iOS or Android or Windows Phone devices.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.110
Now and of course we're going to learn how that works which features ionic to offer you and how you

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.830
would go about creating such native apps.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
Now I'm convinced the best way of learning this is a project driven approach.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.650
Therefore we're going to build four applications in this course and each application is a full real

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.470
application and differ significantly from the average applications so that each application has its

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.310
own focus.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.300
For example the built in components or how navigation works fetching user input and handling it using

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.590
forums using native device features like the camera or fetching user location or using device storage

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.460
or authentication and HTP access.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.270
So a lot of features you're going to need in your real applications and therefore that is what we cover

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.780
here.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.570
Real applications how you would do that.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.780
And of course a lot more will cover the basics.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.520
We will have assignments and math.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.140
I can't wait to dive into that.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
So let's get started by learning what I want to actually ask in the next lecture
