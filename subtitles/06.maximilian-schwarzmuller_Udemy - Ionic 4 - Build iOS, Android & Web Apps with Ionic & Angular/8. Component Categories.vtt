Now to find a solution for the problem of our components sometimes not having the right width on different

00:08.660 --> 00:16.530
screen sizes, it's important to understand that Ionic in its core has three different types of components

00:16.700 --> 00:18.920
and now these are the categories I came up with,

00:18.950 --> 00:24.860
it's not an official term but I think it helps if you think about these components in these terms.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.470
We have components that help us with the output of data,

00:28.610 --> 00:35.580
we have components that help us with layout in the page and organizing and ordering components

00:35.750 --> 00:42.080
and we have components that help us with getting user input. Output components would be things like ion-img,

00:42.100 --> 00:48.110
ion-badge, ion-label, ion-title, ion-toolbar, ion-alert,

00:48.140 --> 00:52.070
so basically components that mostly display things.

00:52.070 --> 00:57.230
Now obviously in that list, there are some things like ion-alert where the user can also press a button

00:57.230 --> 00:58.730
and interact with it,

00:58.730 --> 01:01.110
so of course this component kind of does both

01:01.250 --> 01:06.410
but generally, these components are mostly focused on getting something onto the screen which we want

01:06.410 --> 01:14.360
to display to the user. Layout components are not directly themselves visible but their effect is visible

01:14.660 --> 01:22.100
because they basically allow us to structure content, things like ion-grid which we haven't used yet

01:22.130 --> 01:23.940
but which we'll use in a second,

01:24.040 --> 01:31.720
ion-list, ion-tabs, so basically components that sometimes also have their visible parts like ion-card

01:31.720 --> 01:39.170
but which also are important for grouping things together, ordering elements in a certain way.

01:39.230 --> 01:46.850
And last but not least, input components like ion-button, ion-input, ion-text-area, so all these components

01:46.850 --> 01:54.160
that mostly are there for the user to interact with, to type something, to click something, to tap a button.

01:54.260 --> 01:59.810
These are three important categories and we had a look at elements from all these categories,

01:59.810 --> 02:05.900
now since we have a component that is too wide, we want to shrink that size of the card,

02:05.900 --> 02:09.510
we will probably need some more help from the layout box.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.070
Now I already did put ion-card in there,

02:12.140 --> 02:14.320
you could also put it in the output box,

02:14.450 --> 02:15.800
it kind of does both,

02:15.800 --> 02:21.190
it outputs something with some default styling but it also groups the things together

02:21.410 --> 02:25.070
but what will definitely help us here is the ion-grid.
