Now with the improved routing, let's make sure we can make Michael disappear

00:06.650 --> 00:15.940
when we click on him and for that first of all in my service, I'll add a removePerson method and let's

00:15.940 --> 00:23.980
say I want get the name of that person and that will actually, the way I write it now, remove all persons

00:23.980 --> 00:24.660
with that name,

00:24.670 --> 00:33.730
you can refine this but I'll keep it simple here and then, I'll set this persons equal to this persons

00:33.880 --> 00:34.700
filter.

00:34.780 --> 00:40.570
Filter is a built-in method which executes a function on every element in the array, so it will look at

00:40.570 --> 00:41.900
every person in the array

00:41.920 --> 00:48.160
and here I use an arrow function which is a normal Javascript syntax, next-gen Javascript which is supported

00:48.160 --> 00:57.730
by Typescript and it will then basically keep every person where we now return true and drop every person

00:57.730 --> 01:02.980
where we return false and therefore of course, I'm not hardcoding true or false here but I need a dynamic

01:02.980 --> 01:10.120
condition and I will check if person is unequal to name because this will then be true if the person

01:10.150 --> 01:15.610
we're looking at in the array is not equal to the name we're passing in to remove person. That is the

01:15.610 --> 01:21.730
person I want to remove and therefore if person is equal to name, then this should return false which

01:21.730 --> 01:24.010
is why I need to check for the opposite.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.290
So we're filtering out the person with this name.

01:27.580 --> 01:37.660
We can now call remove person when I click on a person and first of all, let me console log this persons

01:37.670 --> 01:40.010
here to see if that worked correctly

01:40.010 --> 01:44.800
and now let's call remove person when we click on a person by going to our list

01:44.810 --> 01:54.230
item, let's add a click listener and I'll name the method I want to execute onRemovePerson and I'll

01:54.230 --> 01:56.240
forward person here.

01:56.240 --> 02:02.230
Remember that is my local variable here which is just the string extracted from that list of persons.

02:02.330 --> 02:10.790
So onRemovePerson is now a method I need to add in the persons component and there, I will get the person

02:10.880 --> 02:19.070
name as an argument and then I want to reach out to my person service, prs service is the property name

02:19.070 --> 02:28.110
here and call remove person and forward that person name. So that is all I should need to do here.

02:30.180 --> 02:38.000
Now if we go back and I click on Manuel, we see something strange. We see in the console that this seemed

02:38.010 --> 02:38.840
to work,

02:38.880 --> 02:44.490
there is only Max and Anna in the array but here, we don't see that reflected.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.240
Unlike before, Angular didn't update this correctly.

02:48.240 --> 02:54.960
If I navigate to input and back to person list however, it is updated. So it seems like the data was kind

02:54.960 --> 03:01.830
of updated correctly but Angular didn't pick up the change in our array here and that is a common mistake

03:01.860 --> 03:04.680
you can make in Angular and in the next lecture,

03:04.770 --> 03:06.260
I'll show you a way around that.
