00:02.190 --> 00:07.640
Before I delete that let's actually check where we can see this if we are a different user.

00:07.780 --> 00:13.820
And for that let's go to the off service and change our user I.D. to X by set again.

00:14.130 --> 00:18.910
And then the app should now reload and we shouldn't see that booking here hopefully.

00:18.930 --> 00:23.910
Yeah that looks good because it's not a booking by the user and therefore we should not be able to see

00:23.910 --> 00:25.730
it or interact with it.

00:25.740 --> 00:30.080
So let me change this back so that we can see it because now I am the user who created it.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.770
There it is.

00:32.810 --> 00:33.660
Great.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.410
Now of course you can also tweak what you see here on the bookings page.

00:39.410 --> 00:44.260
Right now we have a relatively boring item with our eye and label here.

00:44.300 --> 00:51.800
Of course we could add an an avatar here in our starts a lot of the item and then use an image where

00:51.800 --> 00:57.730
we bind the source here to the booking place.

00:58.130 --> 01:04.480
Image Data something you could also do but that of course is totally not related to deleting the booking

01:04.480 --> 01:05.100
still.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.460
It is something I want to do here.

01:06.490 --> 01:11.830
Looks a bit nicer but now let's make sure that when a swipe does an attempt is we actually don't just

01:11.830 --> 01:17.080
cancel the booking here which has no effect on the server as you see when I reload but that we do cancel

01:17.080 --> 01:22.280
it on the server as well for that back in the booking service.

01:22.380 --> 01:27.510
We have our canceled booking method here and the goal here now is to really delete the booking on the

01:27.510 --> 01:36.760
server and deleting something we haven't done thus far on firebase so here I want to send an HBP request

01:37.270 --> 01:41.770
and also a delete request now and I want to target a specific booking.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.500
So of course our A you are L generally.

01:44.530 --> 01:50.920
Is this your URL but I will already use back tix here so that I can dynamically inject data into this

01:50.920 --> 01:57.100
string because I will not send the request this you URL but instead I'll add a new segment which should

01:57.100 --> 02:03.640
of course be the booking idea of the specific booking I want to get rid of this now is you are l the

02:03.640 --> 02:09.950
delete request should be sent to so that this data under this URL is deleted.

02:10.030 --> 02:15.420
Now here I will return this so that we can wait for this to complete.

02:15.520 --> 02:23.060
But of course I also want to update my bookings to basically Mark that this has been deleted Hensel

02:23.530 --> 02:30.310
pipe some operators in there at the first one is to switch map operator to do nothing with the response

02:30.310 --> 02:32.730
of this delete request because I don't really care.

02:32.830 --> 02:40.480
But to then return my bookings so this booking scatter which gives me my current list of bookings locally

02:40.510 --> 02:42.630
not on the server but locally.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.800
Now here we can be in a scenario where this is an empty array and we tried to remove an element from

02:47.800 --> 02:52.020
it that's not in there because we interact with our bookings here from inside the list.

02:52.030 --> 02:56.940
So if we got the list we can delete them and we can't delete tonight and without having the list.

02:56.950 --> 03:00.370
So here this should be safe and should always give us a list.

03:00.370 --> 03:07.930
And therefore in my next operator here which is the tab operator I will get my bookings list and I will

03:07.930 --> 03:14.440
do the same as I did before I will emit a new list of bookings where I filter out the one which I want

03:14.440 --> 03:15.100
to delete.

03:15.370 --> 03:20.080
And now this will update the bookings not just on the server which is what we do with the delete request

03:20.290 --> 03:27.760
but also locally which of course is also required so loud with that it should actually already work

03:27.790 --> 03:34.470
if I save this and we wait for it is to reload we should be able to swipe this and click the trash bin

03:35.430 --> 03:40.380
and it's canceling and now here we got a problem though.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.000
And do you know what it is.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.860
It's a maximum call stack size exceeded error which means we probably created some infinite loop and

03:48.860 --> 03:51.130
I did a return my bookings here.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.490
And what is bookings.

03:52.490 --> 03:55.190
It of course is my behavior a subject in the end.

03:55.190 --> 04:03.890
So I subscribe to my subject and then I essentially admit a new event here with next and the debt of

04:03.890 --> 04:07.790
course triggers my subject and they offer I created an infinite loop.

04:07.790 --> 04:13.890
The trick of course is to take one as we always should do here to just take one snapshot.

04:14.150 --> 04:15.880
And now with that it should reload here.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.650
And of course I have no booking now because it was deleted before I entered this infinite loop.

04:24.650 --> 04:26.210
So let's quickly add a booking here

04:31.010 --> 04:35.850
let's maybe add to bookings so that we can really be sure that we delete the right one.

04:35.870 --> 04:42.830
Maximilian Schwartz Miller with one guest.

04:43.180 --> 04:44.820
Some traveling alone.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.890
And now let's go to bookings and we should see to booking stare.

04:47.890 --> 04:52.080
And now let's delete the one with one guest and this looks good.

04:52.300 --> 04:57.070
And now over reload this page we should all do still only see the one which we didn't delete and on

04:57.080 --> 04:59.460
firebase as well of course.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.900
And now if I delete that as well.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.480
Well then we have no bookings obviously.

05:04.570 --> 05:09.220
So this is how we can delete the bookings and this all the works quite nice.
