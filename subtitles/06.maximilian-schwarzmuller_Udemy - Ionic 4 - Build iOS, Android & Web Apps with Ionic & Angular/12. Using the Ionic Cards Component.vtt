00:02.510 --> 00:08.070
With the data I have successfully now it's time to work on the content of the quotes page to display

00:08.070 --> 00:11.120
all those quotes we can favorite and unfavorite.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.330
Now as you saw in the slides before I want to have to look like those cards.

00:16.350 --> 00:16.980
It is called.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.970
So those boxes with the nice shadow and so on.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.640
Turns out there is a specific component for this.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.690
Let's have a look at it first in the documentation.

00:25.710 --> 00:30.440
And as a side note I'm just showing you this documentation because I wanted to know where to learn more.

00:30.570 --> 00:34.130
I will of course also show you how to use it in a second.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.000
So let's have a look at cards.

00:36.540 --> 00:41.310
As you can see this is our basic card looks like a box with this nice shadow.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.710
And as you can also see there are different ways of getting this more and more complex.

00:46.710 --> 00:52.330
You can also place lists inside of a card with either lists and then buttons with an item.

00:52.380 --> 00:58.560
You can also place images inside of cards with a simple normal image tag and I on it to will automatically

00:58.770 --> 01:00.840
aligned this to look nice.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.450
So these are all the combinations supported by Ironic.

01:04.710 --> 01:08.620
Now let's go back to our application and build such a card.

01:08.640 --> 01:14.670
It all starts with the iron card element here or component it should say with the selector to use the

01:14.670 --> 01:16.820
bolt and ion card element.

01:17.250 --> 01:23.480
And as explained I want to loop through this element of course because I want to create multiple cards.

01:23.580 --> 01:27.600
So I'm going to place Engy four in it and this is what I meant earlier.

01:27.630 --> 01:33.210
You don't have to raptus in the iron list if you don't want to have this I-List look with the Beginning

01:33.210 --> 01:34.570
and Ending separator.

01:34.590 --> 01:38.920
You can use energy for totally independent of ion list as we do here.

01:39.340 --> 01:41.830
And I want to loop through all the quotes.

01:41.850 --> 01:46.610
So loop through quotes and assign it to a single quote variable here.

01:46.860 --> 01:53.890
OFF-MIKE quote group quotes property just to keep this in mind or just bring this back to your mind.

01:53.940 --> 01:57.890
We have this quotes property to grow group and this is an array of quotes.

01:57.930 --> 02:03.750
This error here so you're on looping for all those quotes and storing the individual quotes in this

02:03.750 --> 02:07.790
quote variable with this I'm replicating this card.

02:08.190 --> 02:13.700
And the most basic card we can create with now is simply output to quote text.

02:13.800 --> 02:21.210
Remember text is d'Este property on a single quote let's do and let's save it to see this in action

02:21.990 --> 02:24.210
in the application if I click on this.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.030
You see those cards.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.820
And yeah it's not super pretty is it.

02:30.870 --> 02:37.760
It of course becomes more pretty or prettier if you wrap it in a paragraph.

02:37.770 --> 02:44.390
Now we have at least a bit better looking card but still not really that nice.

02:44.490 --> 02:46.910
So we can still improve this.

02:46.980 --> 02:54.540
There is a better component to wrap your content in and that is called Card content.

02:54.570 --> 03:00.170
This is specifically made to make you make your content look nice inside the card.

03:00.330 --> 03:07.380
So if we place our code text in there you will see that now we start to get nice results.

03:07.380 --> 03:13.440
Now we have a padding around this quote about this around this text and it already looks much better

03:13.860 --> 03:15.790
but not good enough for us here.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.910
I want to have a more complex card.

03:17.910 --> 03:19.680
We also need this favorite link.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.820
I want to have a title for that card.

03:21.930 --> 03:27.410
And I also want to have a place for you offers sort of because you who created this quote.

03:27.930 --> 03:30.210
Let's start with the title.

03:30.460 --> 03:35.710
We can add such a title a so-called header with the ID card header component.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.320
So ion card header and ID card content are two separate components.

03:42.390 --> 03:47.850
You can place inside of a card and actually as mentioned before if you have a look at the component

03:47.850 --> 03:53.430
documentation here for example with images you see that you can also play some Abra special elements

03:53.520 --> 03:56.580
like the image element additional to card content.

03:56.580 --> 04:01.010
And if you wanted card header so you can also use that in a card.

04:01.170 --> 04:05.910
And again just have a look at the documentation to learn more about your specific use case.

04:05.910 --> 04:10.950
As you can see the I and list would also be an alternative just to many alternatives to go through them

04:10.980 --> 04:11.550
all.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.930
But the theory is always the same.

04:13.950 --> 04:18.750
You have your wrapping and card element and then there do you get a couple of building blocks you can

04:18.750 --> 04:24.150
use and you can just play around with that and place a normal at say age one element in there to see

04:24.150 --> 04:24.970
how that looks.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.040
There's nothing wrong with that.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.610
You can see if that fits your needs.

04:28.620 --> 04:34.840
Always keep in mind you're creating normal aged penal code here in the end with the help of English

04:34.860 --> 04:36.210
two components.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.190
So enough of the talking.

04:38.190 --> 04:42.800
Let's add a header here and the head on one half is actually the number of the current quote.

04:42.990 --> 04:48.720
So a hash tag to just indicate that we have a number and to get the number off the quote I would simply

04:48.720 --> 04:50.830
get the index of the current iteration.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.830
Sallet I equals in Texas dangler to Centex.

04:53.850 --> 04:58.300
Give me that index and stringin tribulation I can then simply output I.

04:58.410 --> 05:00.110
But that would start at zero.

05:00.180 --> 05:04.040
So let's say I plus 1 to actually start at 1.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.170
Now we have a header and we have the content.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.950
Let's see how that looks.

05:08.280 --> 05:14.650
If we load that now see header and contemned looks much nicer.

05:14.790 --> 05:22.020
Now in the next lecture I want to dive deeper on that and actually start improving this card even more

05:22.350 --> 05:28.730
and see which tools I want to give us to provide a nice structure for our content here.
