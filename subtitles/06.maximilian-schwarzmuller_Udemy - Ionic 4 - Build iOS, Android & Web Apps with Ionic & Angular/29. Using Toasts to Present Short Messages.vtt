WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:07.700
So now with the base functionality added let's add some nice messages.

00:07.870 --> 00:13.570
We're going to add toasts and you can always look Aptos in the official documentation tell us are nice

00:13.570 --> 00:18.540
helpful helper messages can read more about them here in the official docs and also the API docs.

00:18.640 --> 00:25.900
But they're super easy to use and one to show a toast if we try to add an ingredient which is empty

00:25.900 --> 00:27.100
for example.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.100
So where we don't enter a valid name now you create hosts we need to.

00:32.110 --> 00:36.640
You guessed it inject a new controller the host controller.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.100
So I'm storing this in a new property named TOSed controller and it's of type to control or this needs

00:42.100 --> 00:44.740
to be imported from ionic or two.

00:44.890 --> 00:49.830
So we're getting a lot of imports there from splitting this up so that it's easier to read.

00:50.170 --> 00:51.560
So Ditto's controller.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.890
Now it's and unstored and Ito's control of property.

00:55.120 --> 01:02.340
Now in create new ingredient alert where I create this alert here I check if we entered a valid value

01:02.770 --> 01:04.790
and if we didn't I want to show it.

01:04.860 --> 01:10.990
Host So I will create a new to your by calling my toast controller and then create as always with Dell's

01:10.990 --> 01:12.090
helper controllers.

01:12.100 --> 01:17.560
So that's really nice you have this common pattern of using There's always and same way the properties

01:17.560 --> 01:23.110
you configure on the Optik you pass your day will vary but the general approach of calling create and

01:23.110 --> 01:25.480
so on is always the same.

01:25.480 --> 01:31.060
So on this test we can set up the message property mass which of course is what we see in the stillest

01:31.150 --> 01:35.520
and again to find a full list of all properties check the API docs.

01:35.530 --> 01:40.850
So here we can say Please enter a valid value because clearly we didn't.

01:40.990 --> 01:46.600
Of course you can find one just to your needs and then you can specify the duration for which you want

01:46.600 --> 01:48.160
to show this toast.

01:48.190 --> 01:51.890
Now you can enter any duration you want here in milliseconds.

01:52.060 --> 01:57.790
I'm going to choose one second so thousand bully seconds and then you get all the defined where you

01:57.790 --> 01:59.370
want to show is toast.

01:59.380 --> 02:05.080
For example at the bottom or somewhere else bottom will be the default though so you would not need

02:05.080 --> 02:08.140
to add this but just to show and explain this.

02:08.320 --> 02:14.160
You can edit overvalues values would be top for example or all the values specified in the API docs

02:14.170 --> 02:15.660
again to find out more.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.050
So I'm going to choose the bottom position.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.760
Now this created the toast.

02:20.830 --> 02:24.250
As always we still need to show it and we do this by calling present.

02:24.250 --> 02:29.730
So again the same pattern as with dialog's actions modals and so on.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.790
So we're presenting this test if we enter an invalid value.

02:33.790 --> 02:43.220
I also want to show it host if the Ingredion was added some don't copy this toast below my code here

02:43.220 --> 02:45.760
where I added a new item before an array.

02:45.950 --> 02:51.120
And here I just wanna say item added and also displayed just for one second.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.280
At the bottom you could of course change to position and then I want to present the toast here too.

02:56.550 --> 03:02.260
And finally one more toast let's say in the actions sheet itself.

03:02.310 --> 03:11.640
If we delete all elements here only if Lang is greater than zero though in this case we actually deplete

03:11.700 --> 03:12.650
some items.

03:12.660 --> 03:20.400
So here I want to say all ingredients were deleted like this all for one second at the bottom and presented.

03:20.490 --> 03:22.380
So if a couple of messages were added.

03:22.380 --> 03:27.750
Now let's see them in action by saving us and recompiling the app and go to the recipes.

03:27.760 --> 03:32.090
Here and Now let's add a new recipe.

03:33.170 --> 03:37.560
Milk and you see the toast at the bottom for a second.

03:39.190 --> 03:43.100
Let's also remove ingredients all ingredients were deleted.

03:43.270 --> 03:46.290
You can of course change duration if that's too short for you.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.310
Let's Cliggott it without any ingredients.

03:48.340 --> 03:53.950
No toast to show now because I placed it inside the if block and if I try to add the invalid ingredient

03:53.980 --> 03:55.750
I get Please enter a valid value.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.020
And actually one second is pretty short.

03:58.120 --> 04:04.700
So maybe let's bump this up to one and a half seconds by increasing two to 1500 milliseconds.

04:04.930 --> 04:11.800
So with this toasts we're at it we're now able to add ingredients and to get some messages regarding

04:11.800 --> 04:12.670
this.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.290
That is a huge step.

04:14.320 --> 04:22.940
And with that we get all we need to finally also save as such a recipe into our service if it's valid.

04:23.050 --> 04:25.920
So let's continue with that in the next lecture.
