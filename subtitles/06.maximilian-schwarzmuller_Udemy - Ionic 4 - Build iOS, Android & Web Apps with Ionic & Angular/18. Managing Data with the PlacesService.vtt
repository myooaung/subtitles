00:01.990 --> 00:09.900
So in the last lecture we added the method to display the image on our place page with all that in place

00:09.910 --> 00:14.180
we can now finally make our page submittal.

00:14.470 --> 00:20.770
So I'll go to the at least template first and on the disabled button I also want to disable the button

00:20.920 --> 00:26.620
if image you are l is equal to an empty string which it is by default where we haven't set an image

00:26.710 --> 00:28.610
so that we're not able to submit this.

00:28.780 --> 00:34.500
If this is indeed an empty string so if no image has been chosen if all of this has been done we took

00:34.500 --> 00:39.550
an image we add a location and we entered all the fields the form Shippey submit a.

00:39.910 --> 00:44.880
And with that we should be able to create a place and store it in some central place.

00:44.890 --> 00:50.440
Now what would be such a central place where could we store it to have access to it from our parts and

00:50.440 --> 00:55.440
are apt to of course we need a service so let's add such a service.

00:55.480 --> 01:04.700
I'm going to add a services folder again in the source folder and add a new places service in this file.

01:04.700 --> 01:11.450
I'm going to export places service class like this.

01:11.450 --> 01:16.900
And then there I went to a private property named places which simply is an array of places.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.590
We do have this place model right stored in the models folder.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.650
So I'm going to import this year and assign an array of such places as a type to displace as property.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.280
And initially it's just an empty array.

01:29.600 --> 01:36.240
As a side note we'll work on permanent device side storage of this data soon so that we can store blace

01:36.240 --> 01:37.390
this year.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.340
Now I want to add placemen that sort of them able to actually set up place.

01:41.510 --> 01:48.650
And here we will simply submit a title which is a string description which is a string location which

01:48.650 --> 01:55.610
is of type location and here we need our own location to be imported from our location model.

01:55.610 --> 01:59.140
And finally I image your L which is a string.

01:59.390 --> 02:07.220
This is d at u r l or excuse me at place method with all those for argument's image your L description

02:07.220 --> 02:08.840
tile and location.

02:09.080 --> 02:15.800
And with the data available we can treat a new place using all that data.

02:15.800 --> 02:23.490
Title description location and image you're all because that's just what our place model expects.

02:23.750 --> 02:27.790
And then we can push this on our array of places.

02:27.860 --> 02:30.830
So this newly created place here that's all.

02:30.830 --> 02:36.320
With that we're adding the place now also we need a way to fetch the places so load places could be

02:36.320 --> 02:37.400
the method name.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.750
And here I simply want to return my array of places.

02:41.930 --> 02:48.230
However with a slice method to just return a copy off it so that we're able to store places and load

02:48.230 --> 02:50.350
a place or load the places.

02:50.570 --> 02:56.150
Now let's go back to the home page and finally work on this to output our old places where we're still

02:56.150 --> 02:57.740
displaying the default content.

02:57.740 --> 03:01.910
Time to get rid of this and it's set up want to display a list of ID cards.

03:01.970 --> 03:05.870
So I'm going to use ion card here like this.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.000
Add energy for on this card.

03:10.660 --> 03:15.930
And I'll loop through all my places and places a property places as a property.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.360
I'd still have to create on this component.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.920
I also want to add a click listener because I want to be able to view the details of the place.

03:24.040 --> 03:31.690
So on open lace and past the place as an argument this method also needs to be created an index card

03:31.760 --> 03:37.750
or place or image and this will automatically lead to a nice styling ironic to will do this when placing

03:37.750 --> 03:44.100
the image inside of a card or this image will be really nicely sitting at the top of our card and lovely

03:44.110 --> 03:45.470
you're going to see it.

03:45.580 --> 03:53.870
And here I want to bind to source property to our place image your L property and below the image.

03:53.950 --> 03:56.220
I'm going to have some content in this card.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.570
Do remember I card content.

03:58.570 --> 04:03.160
Definitely use this in conjunction with image to have it look nice if you're adding an image to your

04:03.160 --> 04:03.960
card.

04:04.600 --> 04:14.940
And then there also the title this title will simply be place title like this and below that I want

04:14.940 --> 04:22.740
to have a paragraph where I say plays description out putting all that data but not the Google Maps

04:22.830 --> 04:28.800
snippet will do this in the detail page in the place page later when we tab on a single place.

04:29.130 --> 04:34.460
So if that were outputting a list of places of course we're not having those places property right now.

04:34.460 --> 04:43.810
So let's go to the home dock TS file to also at this place this property here this should be of type

04:44.270 --> 04:45.310
blace array.

04:45.310 --> 04:52.130
Make sure to import place from our models file and then this is an empty array at the beginning and

04:52.130 --> 04:57.690
then of course I want to populate this array and then want a populated whenever we're loading this page.

04:57.690 --> 05:03.080
So I choose I and you will enter your eye and you will enter.

05:03.510 --> 05:08.060
And in this method here I will simply reach out to my service.

05:08.130 --> 05:13.770
So therefore all at the service to the app module here to the provider's array.

05:14.100 --> 05:20.300
Besides this default ionic error handler I'll also provide my places service.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.100
We saw this before in the Abra Eppes.

05:22.100 --> 05:28.650
Make sure to also at this import at the top of the app module have that in place we can now inject it

05:28.650 --> 05:34.710
here in the constructor of your home not just fall private places.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.300
Service should be injected here.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.390
Make sure to also add to import the file here.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.250
And with that and check that in item view will enter.

05:44.250 --> 05:52.770
I can now said This place is equal to this place a service load places which will be returned me a copy

05:52.770 --> 05:54.330
of the places array.

05:54.620 --> 06:01.590
With that we should see a list of the places we added and we should also be able to add places though

06:01.950 --> 06:04.540
not before hooking up this second method.

06:04.570 --> 06:12.150
Though here we also need to get access to these places service places.

06:12.150 --> 06:18.840
Service needs to be added as an import here in the app place not typescript file too.

06:19.050 --> 06:26.040
And with that the editing on Submit I can now call this place a service at place and submit my place

06:26.040 --> 06:26.480
here.

06:26.730 --> 06:30.320
I can access the title on the form and value property.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.940
The same is true for the description.

06:33.340 --> 06:37.480
And now one but doesn't do a new line to make it a bit easier to read.

06:37.830 --> 06:44.110
And we also need to pass the location where this is stored and the location property is at place page

06:44.110 --> 06:44.980
here remember.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.890
We stored it directly in this property and the same is true for the euro.

06:48.900 --> 06:52.250
This is stored in this image Eurail property here.

06:52.500 --> 06:57.280
So we can pass it like this as we're calling this place Meffert.

06:57.300 --> 07:06.210
In this service there after I want to reset the form and it also want to reset location and image.

07:06.420 --> 07:14.190
So I will set this location equal to this Optik we had here initially like this to reset the location

07:14.710 --> 07:21.140
and I will said image you are l equal to an empty string and set.

07:21.180 --> 07:25.810
This location is set back to false because now we submit that there's.

07:25.860 --> 07:30.670
Now we're back to the new mode with all those emplace.

07:30.800 --> 07:37.400
I'm going to run this online Iowas DeWyze again to see how it looks on there to see if this now works

07:37.400 --> 07:43.180
as it should and if we're now able to add places and display them on a list on our home page.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.260
So the application open on my device.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.270
With that I'm going to add a new location here.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.180
Let's name it.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.190
My home

07:54.080 --> 07:54.960
yea.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.320
When to keep this short and simple.

07:57.430 --> 08:05.470
Also like the location on the map here with confirm and whip's and the Rothera I want to take a photo.

08:05.490 --> 08:10.240
So let's again take this awesome photo of my wall here.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.220
Let's use that photo looks nice and let's now hit at this place.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.750
So it reset the form.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.190
This looks good.

08:19.290 --> 08:23.320
It didn't remove the map area so we should work on this.

08:23.490 --> 08:31.770
But if we go back on awesome places we kind of see the place here though it doesn't really display the

08:31.830 --> 08:36.960
image right so something's wrong with the image it doesn't display this correctly so it kind of works

08:36.960 --> 08:38.520
the image is missing though.

08:38.520 --> 08:44.730
And here we should definitely dismiss or remove this map area once we reset the form.

08:44.730 --> 08:48.630
So these are two changes we need to make to make sure that this works correctly.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.600
Turns out that these are two rather too simple to fix issues.

08:51.600 --> 08:57.360
The first first issue is we're not seeing the map here on there's at least template once we set the

08:57.360 --> 08:58.020
form.

08:58.140 --> 09:02.010
We're seeing the old image but the overall image you're all to be an empty string.

09:02.070 --> 09:05.060
Therefore it's still kind of has the borders of the old image.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.710
But suddenly when we remove the u r l.

09:07.710 --> 09:16.110
So in order to remove this year two I can simply place the NGF directive on the wrapping row and say

09:16.350 --> 09:18.270
only display this image.

09:18.290 --> 09:18.620
Your.

09:18.630 --> 09:20.880
Is not an empty string.

09:21.090 --> 09:26.550
Well on the home page the issue simply was I'm accessing place image which you are l here because I've

09:26.550 --> 09:31.950
used it which you are and the arrow files but in my place model I actually chose image path.

09:32.070 --> 09:37.700
So either change tissue or Al here or we use image path in the home template.

09:37.710 --> 09:41.520
Now I'm going to change it to image your else and so I use doesn't the rest of the application.

09:41.580 --> 09:46.170
So if there's some place we're now setting this property and therefore we're now accessing the right

09:46.170 --> 09:47.450
property again.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.910
So now we should also see it on our front page.

09:50.910 --> 09:58.560
Now with that in place if I now rerun ironic run iOS device like this we should now see that it will

09:58.560 --> 10:05.760
work and we don't have this empty frame on our place page once we're done and that we do actually see

10:05.760 --> 10:07.220
our image on the home page.

10:07.350 --> 10:14.070
So let's see if it works as we expect it to work back in the application going to hit that tap at this

10:14.080 --> 10:14.430
place.

10:14.460 --> 10:16.590
I can either and yet it's my home.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.740
I try to keep those text short here.

10:18.870 --> 10:21.080
So let's just enter home here too.

10:21.230 --> 10:23.850
Let's select a location on the map.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.100
This one here maybe.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.470
And now let's take a photo.

10:27.510 --> 10:34.020
So let's take this photo here use it again we see it here of course.

10:34.020 --> 10:35.710
Now let's hit at this place.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.740
Now you see does this reset correctly.

10:37.740 --> 10:43.900
And if we go back we did see this nice card here with our photo in place.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.430
So that really works as it should.

10:46.470 --> 10:52.510
Next step is to be able to tap this here to open it in detail view and maybe all centered there was

10:52.830 --> 10:54.770
Ted's text below the image.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.400
Let's work on those things in the next lecture.
