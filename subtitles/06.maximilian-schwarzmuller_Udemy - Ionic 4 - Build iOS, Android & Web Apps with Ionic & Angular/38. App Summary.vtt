00:02.260 --> 00:08.480
We're finished our application we're able to favorite Our quotes there and to see them in our application

00:08.480 --> 00:09.950
here in this list.

00:09.950 --> 00:18.050
We're able to switch the background to an alternative one if you prefer to do this we can unfavorite

00:18.050 --> 00:19.840
our quotes of course like this.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.410
You can also Favorite them here or like that.

00:23.420 --> 00:27.710
So we implemented quite a lot features on the two officers.

00:27.740 --> 00:36.860
We implemented a lot of components like cards or buttons or the modal or de-lurk here or the list here

00:37.070 --> 00:42.470
or a sliding list item or the menu here or to the tabs at the bottom.

00:42.470 --> 00:47.930
So quite a lot of components and you learned how to add them how to add tabs how to add your own menu

00:48.140 --> 00:55.990
how to set up a list with buttons or with list items with iron items or how to add such a sliding item.

00:56.030 --> 01:01.030
A lot of things which are very useful which you will probably use in your apps.

01:01.190 --> 01:04.840
You also learned how to theme your apps and we're not even done.

01:04.850 --> 01:07.500
There are free apps to go in this course.

01:07.520 --> 01:15.050
So loads of content ahead of us but we will also dive into how to manage user input how to add authentication

01:15.050 --> 01:20.630
how to use HTP and how to use native device features like the camera something we're not doing at all

01:20.630 --> 01:21.220
here.

01:21.560 --> 01:27.170
But there's really lays out the basics that I can only encourage you to play around with this app.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.690
Dive into the documentation on some components you want to use learn more about those components and

01:32.690 --> 01:35.480
maybe set your own practice app.

01:35.480 --> 01:40.190
But don't forget to all to continue and have a look at the average Continental's course where we will

01:40.190 --> 01:41.930
dive much deeper into it.

01:41.990 --> 01:42.790
See you there.
