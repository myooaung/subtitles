We learned a lot about crucial features of Angular already,

00:05.740 --> 00:12.610
let's also learn how we can handle user input and for that in my persons folder, I'll create a new

00:12.610 --> 00:20.320
component which I'll name person-input.component.ts and we export a class in there and just as

00:20.350 --> 00:22.300
before, I'll name this person

00:22.300 --> 00:30.490
input component using Pascal case notation and to turn this into a component we can use,

00:30.490 --> 00:38.970
I will add @component here, imported from @angular/core. We pass a Javascript object to that decorator

00:39.100 --> 00:45.670
and now we can configure that component and just as before, we want to add a selector, app-person-input

00:45.700 --> 00:51.790
for example, makes sense here and you can see how naming works I guess, you have kebab

00:51.790 --> 00:52.580
case here

00:52.600 --> 00:55.320
which means you separate the words with dashes,

00:55.450 --> 01:03.260
Pascal case here which means you have one big word but every sub-word starts with a capital character.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.760
Now we don't just need a selector, we also want to have a template,

01:06.850 --> 01:10.530
you can also define a template in a string inside of this file

01:10.540 --> 01:17.320
but I always use external files which is also recommended and I will point at a person input.component.html

01:17.440 --> 01:25.770
file which doesn't exist yet so let's create it, person-input.component.html

01:25.780 --> 01:26.930
.

01:26.990 --> 01:33.250
Now just as before, to be able to use this component, we need to register it and we'll do so in the app

01:33.250 --> 01:34.210
module.

01:34.210 --> 01:41.950
So here in declarations, I want to add my person input component and here my IDE automatically added

01:41.950 --> 01:46.060
this import, you need to add this on your own if your IDE doesn't do that,

01:46.060 --> 01:53.380
make sure you are importing person input component from that respective file and add it here to declarations

01:53.530 --> 01:58.360
so that you can use its selector in your templates.

01:58.360 --> 02:05.410
Now with that added, let's say I want to render it above my list of persons.

02:05.410 --> 02:08.500
So here I'll add app person input, like that.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.840
Now of course, my template is pretty empty right now,

02:12.890 --> 02:19.880
it's an empty HTML file and to make it more interesting here, I'll actually add an input element of type

02:19.880 --> 02:31.910
text and maybe a label in front of it where I say it should be for the name, like this,

02:32.070 --> 02:36.130
let's give this an ID of name and save that.

02:36.180 --> 02:39.740
Now if you go back, you should see that input and that label next to it.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.100
Now styling isn't beautiful,

02:41.100 --> 02:42.750
you can add your own styles of course,

02:42.750 --> 02:46.630
I want to focus on the core logic and not so much on CSS.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.470
Now I don't just want to have the input and the label,

02:49.470 --> 02:59.240
I also want to have a button here where I say create and to have some styling now at least, I'll add a person

02:59.300 --> 03:07.250
input.component.css and I just add a styling for label, input and button and I'll all give

03:07.250 --> 03:11.810
them a display block property to make sure they all span into new lines.

03:11.810 --> 03:18.380
Now we just need to point at that CSS file and register it as a styling file for this component

03:18.870 --> 03:25.550
and that is done by adding style URLs in the configuration of this component,

03:25.550 --> 03:31.610
so of the person input component. Now important, this takes an array of paths because you could have more

03:31.610 --> 03:38.820
than one file, you can only have one template but you can have multiple styling files and here, I'll point

03:38.820 --> 03:47.730
at person-input.component.css. And now if I save this, you see we have three lines and we have the

03:47.730 --> 03:54.210
button here at the bottom. Now that is all nice and beautiful but now of course I wanna make sure that

03:54.210 --> 03:59.700
when I hit that button and I just zoomed in, didn't change the styling, just zoomed in a bit more, when

03:59.700 --> 04:05.180
I hit that button, I want to add whatever I entered here as a new element.

04:05.190 --> 04:06.420
Now how can we do that?
