With the service set up, we want to use it in our components and let's start by using it in our persons

00:07.350 --> 00:10.440
component which is where we need that list of persons.

00:10.440 --> 00:17.460
We don't need to add a bindable property here anymore, so we can get rid of that and instead here, I'll

00:17.460 --> 00:25.770
just add my person list again actually which is an array of strings but it's not bindable with @input

00:26.290 --> 00:32.580
but I now want to get my data from the person service and for that, we use that feature called dependency

00:32.580 --> 00:38.850
injection which I mentioned before. We need to tell Angular which dependencies this component has and

00:38.850 --> 00:44.250
we're not doing this through import statements or anything like this because all of these will be removed

00:44.490 --> 00:46.030
in our build step.

00:46.050 --> 00:52.620
Remember, all that gets compiled and merged together, so that's not something Angular can read when the

00:52.620 --> 00:54.300
code executes,

00:54.360 --> 01:00.930
instead we add a constructor here to our class. That's a built-in function that will run automatically

01:01.170 --> 01:04.640
whenever Angular creates a new instance of this component,

01:04.680 --> 01:12.380
so essentially whenever it starts creating the component for rendering. In this constructor, we can accept

01:12.470 --> 01:13.390
arguments

01:13.550 --> 01:20.360
and since we will never instantiate this class on our own but Angular will do this, it's Angular's job

01:20.420 --> 01:23.890
to give us all the arguments we expect here.

01:23.900 --> 01:30.200
Now of course Angular will fail to do so if we want to get anything arbitrary here but it will succeed

01:30.470 --> 01:40.280
if we expect something which is injectable, like our persons service. So here, I can now get for example

01:40.280 --> 01:42.160
my prs service,

01:42.170 --> 01:49.160
that name is up to you but important here is that you now add a type definition which is persons service

01:49.220 --> 01:52.870
and you need to import that from your persons service file

01:52.880 --> 01:56.070
otherwise Typescript doesn't find that type.

01:56.360 --> 02:03.800
Now Angular will actually be able to now resolve this service by that type,

02:03.980 --> 02:12.290
it will look if it finds this type, if it knows how to create an object based on that type and it is

02:12.290 --> 02:20.360
able to do so because you marked this class, which automatically also acts as a type, with injectable.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.380
So this is how dependency injection works

02:22.440 --> 02:27.140
and now person service is made available here, only in the constructor though.

02:27.150 --> 02:34.290
Now what we can do now is we can set this person list, so this property of this class, equal to

02:34.590 --> 02:37.590
person service persons here, 

02:37.620 --> 02:44.370
so our list of persons we have in the service. If you do that and save everything, you will see your list

02:44.700 --> 02:46.080
of persons again.
