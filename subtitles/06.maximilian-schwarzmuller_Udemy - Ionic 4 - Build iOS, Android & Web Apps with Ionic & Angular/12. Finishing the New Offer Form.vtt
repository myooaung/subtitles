Now of course here in this forum we can also show error messages when the input is invalid.

00:07.930 --> 00:12.900
Now I'll not do it here for the title but I'll do it for the description because there it might be unclear

00:12.910 --> 00:16.600
that one possible error source is that it's too long.

00:16.600 --> 00:23.500
So here you're all at ion row and in that I enroll at a I in column and that column will of course receive

00:23.500 --> 00:27.280
the same sizing asked column which holds the actual input.

00:27.490 --> 00:39.920
And then here all add paragraph where say description must not be longer than 180 characters like that

00:43.330 --> 00:50.470
and I want to show that row only if our description input is invalid and has been touched.

00:50.470 --> 00:54.190
Now how do we get access to that grievously in the template driven approach.

00:54.190 --> 00:58.540
We added a local reference to the control and assign it to energy model.

00:58.570 --> 01:06.250
Well here in a reactive approach we already do have access to the entire form here on this forum property

01:06.840 --> 01:08.080
and they offer in our template.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.600
Here in NJ if I can just reach out to forum and now to get access to a specific control there is a get

01:13.690 --> 01:19.780
method to which I pass the name of that control which here is description and then there I can access

01:19.900 --> 01:21.880
valid and so on.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.360
So here I can access valid and check if it's not valid.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.570
Now of course I also want to make sure that the user had a chance to interact with the input.

01:29.800 --> 01:40.820
Therefore all all the check if form gets description touched is true and now we can save that to see

01:40.820 --> 01:44.370
whether that works as it reloads.

01:44.450 --> 01:51.230
No error here but if I type in here and I click out of that now I see the error of course I also see

01:51.230 --> 01:57.320
the error because I didn't enter anything here therefore maybe we should sharpen this message and we

01:57.320 --> 02:09.040
say description must be between one and 180 characters and this should be clearer now a safe does again

02:09.040 --> 02:12.620
we should have a better user experience because we show a useful message here.

02:12.730 --> 02:16.840
If this is invalid let's also try breaking that one hundred and eighty characters.

02:16.840 --> 02:22.000
Case here by just entering a lot of characters here and that looks good.

02:22.010 --> 02:29.360
I did lose focus and yet it's and still it's invalid if I cleared us however an entry a shorter text

02:29.540 --> 02:30.580
this works.

02:30.590 --> 02:36.080
Now of course you can't add more error messages for example although to the price if you want to or

02:36.080 --> 02:37.220
to the dates.

02:37.220 --> 02:40.920
But I'll leave it like this and instead I want to have a look at this button.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.170
Of course this button should only be principle when it is form is valid and otherwise it should be disabled.

02:48.170 --> 02:54.770
Now this can be implemented in a relatively easy way because we have access to our form property year.

02:54.770 --> 03:02.360
We can go up to that button and there I will simply set the disabled attribute again and I'll disable

03:02.360 --> 03:06.950
this if form valid is false.

03:07.010 --> 03:11.870
So if the form is not valid and that's all I don't care about anything else I can just check if the

03:11.870 --> 03:13.480
entire form is valid or not.

03:13.580 --> 03:18.770
And I do disable it button if it's not and then for now does buttons disabled as you can see.

03:19.100 --> 03:24.550
But if I enter something here and here and I do choose valid dates here.

03:24.770 --> 03:31.100
Now as I lose focus on the last date this becomes active that's done you off your form.

03:31.150 --> 03:36.640
Obviously I'm not doing anything with the data we gather here will add this over the next lectures that

03:36.640 --> 03:42.040
we actually store it as and later also centers to a server but being able to fetch the data is already

03:42.040 --> 03:43.990
a great first step.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.420
Now what about editing places though.

03:46.480 --> 03:51.190
We got these places here we got this added button we got the added offer page but on that page we're

03:51.190 --> 03:56.710
not doing anything so let's make sure that there we also load data about the place we select that here

03:57.010 --> 03:58.900
and that were then able to edited.
