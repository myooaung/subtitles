00:02.310 --> 00:07.770
So with our first logic added her, let's now make sure that when we click this confirm button, we do

00:07.770 --> 00:11.810
store the title or the description of the expense,

00:11.810 --> 00:21.660
the reason and also the amount. So for this, I'll add a constant, entered reason here where I access the

00:21.660 --> 00:24.600
reason input and since this is an input element,

00:24.600 --> 00:29.460
it will have a value property we can read to get the value the user entered.

00:29.460 --> 00:36.000
I'll also store the entered amount by accessing the amount input and then having a look at the

00:36.000 --> 00:37.440
value there.

00:37.530 --> 00:43.110
Now we could continue with these values but I want to make sure that the user did enter valid values

00:43.530 --> 00:48.440
and for that, we can add our own simple validation logic by adding an if check here

00:48.660 --> 00:56.400
and if the entered reason here, when we trim that which will remove excess whitespace at the beginning

00:56.400 --> 01:03.540
and the end, if the length is then smaller or equal to zero, then the user didn't enter anything.

01:03.540 --> 01:10.640
Also, if the entered amount is smaller or equal to zero, so not its length

01:10.670 --> 01:17.810
but the real value, then the user entered a negative or a zero expense amount which is not a valid amount.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.670
Or last but not least if for the entered amount,

01:21.770 --> 01:30.160
when we trim it, if then its length is smaller or equal to zero, then the field is simply left empty.

01:30.180 --> 01:37.110
So now I have this check and for now, I'll just return here to basically stop the execution of this function

01:37.260 --> 01:38.900
and not continue any further

01:38.940 --> 01:47.040
if the values are invalid. Now if the values are valid, then I want to continue and for now, I can then

01:47.040 --> 01:57.960
console log entered reason and entered amount here. So let's go back, reload this page and enter a reason

01:57.960 --> 02:06.680
here, food for let's say 12.99 and add this expense and we see food 12.99 here

02:06.770 --> 02:12.160
on the right. Of course seeing it here in the console is nice but not all we want,

02:12.260 --> 02:15.200
now before we continue though, let me check the validation.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.600
If I don't enter an expense reason,

02:17.630 --> 02:19.850
then we see nothing gets printed on the right,

02:19.850 --> 02:21.000
so this works

02:21.200 --> 02:28.820
and if I enter let's say a value of 0 and a valid reason here, then this also doesn't get printed,

02:29.030 --> 02:31.340
with an expense amount of 1, it does.

02:31.340 --> 02:32.980
So our validation works,

02:32.990 --> 02:39.680
now let's make sure we actually create Ionic elements dynamically in Javascript code to then attach them

02:39.710 --> 02:43.940
below our card and render them with our entered reason and amount.
