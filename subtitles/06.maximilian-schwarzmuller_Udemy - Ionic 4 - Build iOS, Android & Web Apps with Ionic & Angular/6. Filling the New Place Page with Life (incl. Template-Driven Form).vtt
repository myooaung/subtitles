WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:06.830
And The Last Lecture we hooked up this navigations so that we're able to go to the place page.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.460
Now I want to go there in the editor too so that we can start working on this template and create a

00:12.460 --> 00:16.270
form which allows us to add a page for this I'm going to remove this comment.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.980
And here in the title I'm just going to say add a place because that is what you're able to do on this

00:20.980 --> 00:21.650
page.

00:21.820 --> 00:25.340
And then I'll add a form without the action as before.

00:25.340 --> 00:29.350
In the last sections because again this will be handled by angler too.

00:29.620 --> 00:33.950
And then I'll add an iron list in this form with a couple of iron items.

00:33.970 --> 00:38.170
The first item I'll add here is responsible for the title.

00:38.230 --> 00:44.700
So I'm going to add I a label which just says title and I want to label to be of the fixed type.

00:44.740 --> 00:51.460
So to be fixed on the left and then have the input placed on the right of it does inport has there for

00:51.490 --> 00:53.570
also to be added here.

00:53.590 --> 01:00.420
This I an input it will be of type text because it is normal text I enter here.

01:00.580 --> 01:04.780
It will also receive a placeholder to indicate what you may enter.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.640
This is of course optional but I will add it.

01:06.880 --> 01:14.170
Let's say beautiful church is your awesome place what you are taking a photo of right now of beauty.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.760
Maybe spell it correctly beautiful.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.630
And besides this text that the placeholder.

01:19.630 --> 01:24.310
We also need a name because we're going to use the template driven approach.

01:24.400 --> 01:29.100
The name should just be title because that's what we're storing right.

01:29.140 --> 01:35.320
We don't add Engy model to register it as a control on this automatically inferred form.

01:35.350 --> 01:42.910
And finally I will also add the required attribute to make it well required to add the Somali Dacian.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.070
This is the first input.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.860
Now I will add another input here.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.150
Nobbler I an item with a label inside of it.

01:50.150 --> 01:53.110
This label should float up once you click into the input.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.750
This is why Attas floating style.

01:55.750 --> 01:59.260
And here I will say a short description because this is what I want to enter.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.400
A short description of the place.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.130
Now your.

02:02.140 --> 02:09.360
You could use an input but since I want to have a description I'll add Ayane text area like this.

02:09.520 --> 02:16.960
And on this ion text area I will set up a name which is description and then I'll set up and model and

02:17.050 --> 02:20.700
also add required to make it required.

02:20.710 --> 02:23.810
So what does this text area is set up to.

02:23.950 --> 02:28.000
Now we have the title enter description and place days.

02:28.050 --> 02:35.940
I was asked to submit this basic information but it will also already prepare the well parts for the

02:36.210 --> 02:39.600
parts of our form and so these sections for the other parts of our form.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.320
Like for example the ability to choose a location and so on.

02:43.320 --> 02:49.430
I will do this outside of the list but still inside of this form element.

02:49.550 --> 02:59.610
The first thing I want to add outside of this list is I am grade because I want to place things in a

02:59.610 --> 03:05.310
great year they're all at I and row in and this first row in the column of this row.

03:05.310 --> 03:11.130
The goal is to hold a button which allows us or hold two buttons actually next to each other in two

03:11.130 --> 03:12.020
columns.

03:12.030 --> 03:17.160
The goal is to have the buttons which allow us to either choose our current location automatically or

03:17.160 --> 03:18.690
select one on the map.

03:18.690 --> 03:25.290
So in a first column I'm going to add a button which will receive the iron button directive to make

03:25.290 --> 03:26.730
it look like a button.

03:27.180 --> 03:35.160
But then I will also add de block style to have it spanned over the full with the outline style.

03:35.170 --> 03:39.280
You have no background and then also type.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.030
But this is important because we're inside a form right.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.370
We're inside a foreign text.

03:43.470 --> 03:48.130
So if we wouldn't design type button here hitting this button would submit the form.

03:48.150 --> 03:49.600
And this is not what I want to do.

03:49.610 --> 03:55.460
Instead I want to open a new window or here on this button where we automatically detect the location

03:55.460 --> 03:59.230
I just want a trigger that action I don't want to submit the form.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.000
So type button is important here to prevent this button from submitting the form.

04:04.200 --> 04:10.890
And with all that configured I will also add Iken left because this button will hold both an icon and

04:10.920 --> 04:11.970
text.

04:12.240 --> 04:17.960
And of course finally a click listener which does something when we hit the button here are executed

04:18.030 --> 04:24.350
on locate Mefford which of course hasn't been added yet inside of the button here or one of two things.

04:24.360 --> 04:30.750
For one I can this is why I added Eicken left here and this will be the Locate I can again taken from

04:30.750 --> 04:37.620
the official I can repository which is a fitting icon for the auto location action and next to it are

04:37.620 --> 04:39.840
placed to text located me.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.880
So that's the first button and the first column and then add another column in the same row because

04:44.880 --> 04:46.780
I want to have another button in there.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.870
This button will also receive I button.

04:50.340 --> 04:57.550
It will also be a block button and it will also just be an outline button with no background here.

04:57.570 --> 05:03.150
I will then also assign the type but because this button asks the first button shouldn't submit our

05:03.150 --> 05:08.800
form instead of Cherchez Chichester's some action the action of one trigger will be described.

05:08.860 --> 05:12.030
First of all and I can left as on the top button.

05:12.030 --> 05:13.420
Now I'll hook up the action.

05:13.410 --> 05:17.420
The click listener here and I want to open a new page.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.580
You're the map to Google map.

05:19.740 --> 05:25.950
So here I'll say on open map and this method should then navigate us to a new page which displays Google

05:25.950 --> 05:27.730
Maps to us.

05:27.750 --> 05:31.830
Now if that button is configured but we also need to add some content.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.830
So that's at I and I can go.

05:34.110 --> 05:41.460
And in this I can I'm going to use the map I can all chosen from the official repository and then say

05:41.550 --> 05:43.480
select on map here.

05:43.890 --> 05:47.240
So let's have a look at how this looks like we're not done yet.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.780
But I want to see if we're on the right track.

05:49.830 --> 05:56.430
So going back to the map does looks all right we got our little forum up here where we can enter a description

05:56.460 --> 06:02.880
and a title and then we get the two buttons below it where we can locate ourselves or select a position

06:02.910 --> 06:03.510
on the map.

06:03.510 --> 06:07.400
Again they won't work as of now but we'll work on this soon.

06:07.530 --> 06:15.180
Now before going to making those patents work I want to finished is for him here with the two buttons

06:15.240 --> 06:15.700
added here.

06:15.720 --> 06:21.630
It would be nice to also see a select the place if we have selected one so I will add another row but

06:21.660 --> 06:27.630
below those buttons and then there are later when I display a snippet I Google Maps snippet of where

06:27.630 --> 06:29.300
I display to select the place.

06:29.310 --> 06:34.470
So for now I'm going to add a paragraph where I say select that place but will later replace this with

06:34.470 --> 06:39.360
the actual Google Maps snippet where we highlight the place which was selected so that we can see that

06:39.360 --> 06:40.500
we indeed at a place.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.990
Otherwise we get no wish representation of this and we can see if it's stored in some back property

06:46.110 --> 06:48.150
we want to see it on our UI.

06:48.540 --> 06:53.270
So this role will be added if we do have a place selected.

06:53.610 --> 06:56.790
And with that I can go to the image part.

06:56.790 --> 07:03.810
So below the place partir I'll add a new row and there will add a new column and then this column I'm

07:03.810 --> 07:11.910
going to say text center and have a little heading 8:5 heading maybe where I say take all text take

07:12.000 --> 07:16.770
a photo to motivate to use or to take a photo and then below that.

07:16.770 --> 07:23.030
Ana Navarro Let's add another column with a button which allows us to open the camera.

07:23.190 --> 07:29.370
So this button here will as always receive the iron button attribute to make it look like a button I

07:29.450 --> 07:33.180
can left because that would include the icon which should be placed on the left.

07:33.300 --> 07:39.270
It will be of type block and it will be of type outline as the above buttons and it will be a button

07:39.270 --> 07:43.160
type to also prevent this button from submitting the page.

07:43.170 --> 07:48.770
And finally I'll add a click listener way say on take photo and this will trigger some method opening

07:48.770 --> 07:55.600
the camera and the end in the button let's add I can with I and I can name is camera.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.820
Does this fit in camera.

07:56.830 --> 08:01.360
I can I own two ships with and I'll say open camera as a text here.

08:01.680 --> 08:07.140
So if that that Buckner's edit the last piece is asked for a place here.

08:07.350 --> 08:10.320
I also want to show a preview of the image we took.

08:10.320 --> 08:16.610
So add another I-and robe Lowder's take a photo button you're with the eye and color inside of it.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.780
And here I want to give a preview of the photo we took.

08:20.010 --> 08:26.970
So I'm going to add image tech your normal image tech and I'm going to use property binding here to

08:26.970 --> 08:33.450
bind to some property to some image we're displaying now does empty we will populate this later.

08:33.580 --> 08:38.560
So this will allow us to see a preview of the image we actually took and I want to will automatically

08:38.560 --> 08:43.700
resize this image to fit nicely on the screen and into this column so that's nice.

08:44.470 --> 08:50.290
So with all this emplace I can now add another row and the number column and this will be the last one

08:50.290 --> 08:52.550
where you have to submit button for this form.

08:52.570 --> 08:58.980
So all of type in button of course but in there I simply want to have a secondary color to make this

08:58.990 --> 09:03.660
a green button which always looks more friendly and like hey we can do something good.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.920
Ultimate good of type block to have it span over the full width.

09:06.970 --> 09:11.810
And more importantly the type is submit because this button should submit to the form.

09:11.890 --> 09:21.070
I will say add days place on this button to add displays to our list of places we're going to find you

09:21.070 --> 09:22.140
in this form later.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.720
But with that we have a basic form in place.

09:25.810 --> 09:30.460
Now I'm going to chopt the form header and what I want to do here is I want to get a reference to the

09:30.460 --> 09:33.980
form with F equals and the form we saw this before.

09:34.150 --> 09:38.360
And at the end you submit Mefford so that we can actually.

09:38.460 --> 09:43.120
Listeners should say so that we can actually do something when the form gets submitted and you execute

09:43.450 --> 09:47.220
on submit and pass the form as an argument.

09:47.530 --> 09:53.500
Also with the form now being extracted and stored and the F little variable here I can go down to my

09:53.500 --> 10:02.800
submit button here and at the WIPs at the disabled binding here to disable the spot if the form is not

10:02.830 --> 10:04.060
valid.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.310
So this is all set up.

10:06.430 --> 10:11.650
Let's now finish this lecture by going to the component to the AT place component file to the typescript

10:11.650 --> 10:17.380
file here removing this comment and all the bullshit boilerplate and adding the ends up at method where

10:17.380 --> 10:20.550
we know we will get a form of type entry form.

10:20.560 --> 10:27.850
Make sure to import this from angular forms and that in onze of and I will simply log my form value

10:27.850 --> 10:29.460
to see that this works.

10:29.470 --> 10:32.800
So let me save this and let the pre-compiled Let's have a look.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.770
If this looks all right and if the submission works it does look good.

10:37.780 --> 10:42.580
We can't judge if we're able to see the map and the camera we will work on this later.

10:42.580 --> 10:50.980
Let's now Tester's by adding some text year and a little description and then hit at this place we see

10:50.980 --> 10:54.910
the object with those two fields that looks all right with that.

10:54.910 --> 10:59.120
The basic form is set up nothing new so far.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.020
Let's next start working on picking a location
