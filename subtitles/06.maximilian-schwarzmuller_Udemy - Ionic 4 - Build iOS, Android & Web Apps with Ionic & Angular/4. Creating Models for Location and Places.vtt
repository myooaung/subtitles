00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.710
In the last lecture we created those pages.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.030
Let's now work on the models for our app.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.600
I'm going to create a new models folder in the source folder where I want to store in my models and

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.210
I will start with the location model in there.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.030
So I'm going to create a new file location dot TS and this will simply export a class which I'll name

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.750
a location here want to define how a location should look like in my app.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.080
Now of course that could differ for your app but I want to have my location to have a public property

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.850
let for the latitude which will be a number and a public property long or LNG for along that route which

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.210
will also be a number because location is simply defined by these two properties but these two number

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.210
is a latitude and longitude.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.430
So that's a robber's simple model but one will use quite a lot for the app.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.240
The first usage appears here in the place dot TS and the model for a place a place of course is more

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.410
than just a location a place also includes the image for example.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.980
So let's export this place class here.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
And again I'll use the pub construct or shortcut wifi access or here here to create property and assign

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630
a value in one step.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.970
And the first property as a place should have is the title the title we can enter in this form and we

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.050
create a place.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
I also want to have a description on my place which will also be a string.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.380
And I'm going to split this up a remodel blinds that it's easier to read.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.570
Besides that tile and description I also want to have a location which will be of type location.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.480
And here I need to import the location I just created a few seconds ago.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.410
So from this dot slash location POV year from my location file.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.270
Well and last but not least my place should not only have title description and location it should also

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.810
have an image hogger here.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.950
I will store the path to that image so I'll name this image path and make of type string.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.710
So this will not be the image itself.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.210
Instead the image will be stored somewhere else on the device and this will only store the path to that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.390
image which is the pattern you should use.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.770
So with that I have a place which will store all the data about a place I need.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.990
And if that were set to now start working on our app and start hooking up the navigation so that we

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.930
are able to go to this new place page and then set up this new place page so that we can start adding

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.540
places.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.640
Let's start with all those things in the next lecture.
