00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,460
When someone says, "Let's use Swagger in this project",

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,180
what exactly do they mean?

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,840
Swagger started out as a simple open source specification

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,850
for designing RESTful APIs in 2010.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,610
In 2015, the Swagger project was acquired by SmartBear Software.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,710
The Swagger specification was donated to the Linux

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,340
Foundation and renamed the OpenAPI.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:32,140
The OpenAPI specification is a standard for RESTful APIs. For example,

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,160
here is a JSON document that was generated from this Spring

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
Data REST project that describes the API in a way that

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,590
follows the OpenAPI specification.

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,730
Swagger UI is the software that can read that JSON document

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,720
generated from your project and display the information about

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,740
your API in a humanâ€‘readable form.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,140
The Swagger API is also a REST client you can use to interact with your API.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,680
There are several other Swagger tools available to

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,990
help with design, documentation, test, and deployment of your API.

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,730
You can learn more at http://swagger.io. Springfox is a library that

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,040
makes it easy to generate Swagger from a Spring project.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,020
It utilizes existing Spring annotations to generate the Swagger document and

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,240
also supports Swagger annotations you may use in your code.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,960
Overall,

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,450
you want to maintain a balance of not adding

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,840
documentation information just to add it.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,530
For example, if you had an Employee class with a name attribute,

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,540
it doesn't really add much clarity to put Employee name.

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,440
Let me say that again.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,540
Sometimes less documentation is more clear to the end user.

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,280
If there's nothing more to say than the class name and the attribute name,

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,380
then don't bother.

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,500
Leave it alone.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,960
Your code and documentation will be more clear and easier to maintain.

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,220
Springfox tries to maintain defaults that makes sense for a Spring project so

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,740
you're not forced to add annotations all over the place.

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,520
Now that you understand a little more about Swagger,

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,830
and you've seen the end result, join me in the next module,

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:23,000
where we'll go through the details of how to use Swagger in your Spring Data REST API project.
