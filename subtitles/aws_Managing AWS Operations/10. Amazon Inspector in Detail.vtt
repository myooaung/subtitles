00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.800
[Autogenerated] Now I have a load of the ready.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.120
So when you come to this screen,

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.610
you're going to see the get started screen we can see.

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.740
It gives you the typical definition of what the service does.

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.560
And then there's a few different articles we can choose from your install,

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.510
run and analyze.

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.960
And then we have the basic getting started in

8
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.110
documentation links at the bottom here.

9
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.260
So I'm gonna click on Get Started and we can see it's

10
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.160
initially going to welcome us Hate.

11
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.030
Welcome to Amazon Inspector,

12
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.740
and we can see that it states that it's going to check for security exposures

13
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.620
and these different vulnerabilities in our easy to instances.

14
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.090
And we can see that it also allows us to an easy assessments set

15
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.980
up so we can set up for network assessments.

16
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.860
And you can see that it lists that inspector agent isn't

17
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.240
not required for network assessments, and then underneath it,

18
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.190
you can see that it talks about what's being performed.

19
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310
It's gonna check our network configuration,

20
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.100
run an analysis on that,

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.960
and that's gonna check reports that might be reachable from the outside.

22
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.450
And you can see as an optional thing here where it

23
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.320
says if the agent is installed, it can also find processes reachable in a port.

24
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.030
So it's gonna dive in a little bit deeper than just

25
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.650
the outer layer of our instances.

26
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.710
And then we see a demo or an example, I should say, of a pricing breakdown.

27
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.300
The next option we see is our host assessments,

28
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.980
and this requires our agent to be installed,

29
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.780
and we can see that this performs a few different assessments.

30
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.680
It's gonna do see ve scanning so vulnerabilities

31
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.420
it's gonna look for host hardening.

32
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.800
And then it's going to see if we meet security best practices.

33
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.470
And underneath that it talks about how we can deploy our agents.

34
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.200
So it's going to say that it requires an agent to be installed and you

35
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.360
can actually utilize the Systems Manager run command,

36
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.710
which we actually talked about in a previous clip to install this

37
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.950
inspector agent on all of your instances very easily.

38
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.960
Now for this clip,

39
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.050
I actually already have an Amazon Lennix instance spun up

40
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.300
that has the inspector agent pre installed.

41
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.590
It's actually one of the AWS provided AM eyes that you can use.

42
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.980
So when we actually start looking at the terminal.

43
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.630
We'll see what that looks like now.

44
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.620
The next thing we see here is we can run weekly,

45
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.540
which is the recommended practice.

46
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.760
We can run this once to see what it does or weaken going to advance set up.

47
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.760
So since this is a clip, when we're trying to learn deeper into it,

48
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.220
let's do advanced set up here and it takes us to another page.

49
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.740
Now it's just going to give us a less gooey looking type of interface here,

50
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.460
and it requires a little bit more configuration.

51
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.190
So we'll leave the name, the default assessment target all instances,

52
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.020
and you can see the next option is if we want to run this on

53
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.990
all instances in our account and region.

54
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.640
So if I uncheck this,

55
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.800
we can see that weaken scanned by tags instead of running on all of them.

56
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.940
So if I wanted to search for a certain key value pair for a tag instance,

57
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820
I can do that for this clip.

58
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.090
I'm gonna go in select all instances just to be safe,

59
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.940
and then underneath that we see install agents.

60
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.260
Now,

61
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.790
this is going to allow Amazon Inspector to install the Amazon Inspector

62
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.190
agent on all of our instances in this assessment target,

63
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.340
so you'll see they're nowhere.

64
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.850
It says if you're going to do this,

65
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.940
you need to make sure that your E C two instances have the

66
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.210
s s m agent installed in the role that allows them to

67
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.130
communicate with the run come in.

68
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.010
So I don't need this.

69
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.890
So I'm gonna unsa like this because I already have it installed,

70
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.300
and I'm gonna click next.

71
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.890
The next thing we do is to find an assessment template.

72
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.700
So this is where we're essentially specifying all of our

73
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.150
properties and rules that we want to run here.

74
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.140
So I'll leave the name the same assessment template default.

75
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.540
And then you can see we can actually either remove or add these

76
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.030
different rules packages that are in here.

77
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.320
So if I wanted to, I could take out, let's say,

78
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.900
C I s operating system configuration benchmarks here,

79
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.500
and then I can add a different one of run time behavior

80
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.140
analysis so you can kind of swap out which ones you want to

81
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.380
use for different assessments.

82
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.660
So I'm actually gonna go and take this out and let's just

83
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.890
leave these three here network reach ability,

84
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.920
security, best practices and see ve.

85
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.250
So this should hopefully speed up our assessment time as well.

86
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.130
Now, the duration is the next configurable option.

87
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.120
You can see AWS recommends a one hour duration and you

88
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.020
see their note under your it saying, Hey,

89
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.120
you can modify this,

90
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.250
but understand that the longer durations are gonna have a

91
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.680
fuller set of findings because you can run these different

92
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.680
scans at a deeper in longer level.

93
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.630
Now, for this clip,

94
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.690
I'm gonna set it to 15 minutes because I want to speed this up.

95
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.570
But it's good to know that you can actually select all the

96
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.560
way up to 24 hours if you wanted to.

97
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.390
So I'm gonna leave 15 for now and let's move on.

98
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.640
The next thing we see here is that we can actually

99
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.530
set up an assessment schedule.

100
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.390
So if we wanted to weaken, set this up to recur once every so many days,

101
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.540
and it's good to note that the first run is going to

102
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.010
start on this initial creation, so it's going to start right away,

103
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.150
and then on this recurring schedule that we set now,

104
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.370
I'm not going to set one up,

105
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.790
but it is recommended to run it at least once weekly,

106
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.600
for your resource is so I'm gonna go and un select this so it's not enabled,

107
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.450
and then I'm gonna click on next.

108
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.300
Now we move to the review screen.

109
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.030
So if we wanted to weaken, review all of this and if needed,

110
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.680
choose one of these edit _______ over here on the right in

111
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.720
order to edit some of these settings, It all looks good to me.

112
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.800
So what I'm gonna do is scroll down here and I'm gonna click on create.

113
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.430
And there we go.

114
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.620
Success assessment runs started.

115
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.400
So actually, while this is running,

116
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.040
I'm actually gonna scroll over to my terminal.

117
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.940
And I'm actually SS aged into the instance that this assessment is running

118
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.880
on now to verify that our agent is installed and running,

119
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.630
there's a command you can run, which is listed here,

120
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.010
and this is in the documents that they provide.

121
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.940
But if you run a status command on this a W s agent,

122
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.650
you can see that we get all of the different configurable is that are in place.

123
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.490
So if I scroll up here, you're going to see the agent i d Which is the instance?

124
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.630
Name or instance I d I should say you see collecting true here.

125
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.580
And then you can see her last registration attempt day all the

126
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.520
different dates as well as our assessment Orn that are specific

127
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.970
to this assessment and this target.

128
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.640
So this is basically a dump in a readable format of what's

129
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.410
being configured and assessed on this instance.

130
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.200
So I'm actually gonna go back to our console screen here.

131
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.110
I'm gonna click, refresh one time, and we can see it's collecting data.

132
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.140
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to pause this

133
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.750
clip and then after about 15 minutes,

134
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.030
I'll go ahead and resume it and we'll take a look at

135
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.050
all of the data that was collected.

136
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.340
OK, so I've been letting this run for a few minutes.

137
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.470
I'm actually not going to let it run for 15 minutes because it

138
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.920
probably is not gonna come back with any findings,

139
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.700
so it's really not necessary.

140
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.970
But as you can see, this is still collecting data here.

141
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.120
So if I drop this down, we can see this assessment run that's going on.

142
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.670
There's a status of collecting data.

143
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.830
We've had zero findings so far,

144
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.930
but with a neat little feature here is we can show our agents that

145
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.240
are running and you can see our instance I d.

146
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.030
It's truncated,

147
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.690
obviously the status of it and then the status of the

148
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.700
actual inspector agent as well.

149
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.650
So it's collecting data, something click OK here.

150
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.830
And the next thing I want to show us show status so we can see that it has been

151
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.110
analyzing all of our instances for the past five minutes in the service itself

152
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.340
has received 645 messages from this one agent,

153
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.930
so you can kind of keep track of what's going on and how

154
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.320
many messages are being reported back.

155
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.240
Now they scroll back up to the top here, you'll see on the left.

156
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.090
We also have a dashboard screen.

157
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.460
So when you come to inspector after you configure it,

158
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.640
you'll see this dashboard and you can see you can have

159
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.740
them help you create a new assessment.

160
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.950
But what I want to show you is really you can see your different findings that

161
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.870
are coming on as well as your different assessment statuses,

162
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.830
so you can see We have one running right now,

163
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.320
which is the one we kicked off.

164
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.840
And obviously we've had none of them complete in.

165
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.950
None of them fail.

166
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.130
So after this is done, this one should move to either completed or failed.

167
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.430
And if there are any findings with it,

168
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.410
we're going to see it under here in notable findings.

169
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.920
So this will allow us to quickly jump to any findings which will be

170
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.340
