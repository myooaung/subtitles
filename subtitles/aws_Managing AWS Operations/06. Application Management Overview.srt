00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,220
[Autogenerated] All right, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,410
So now that we have a grasp on operations management

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,760
in the different capabilities, let's dive into application management.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:10,950
Now,

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,830
this is a sweet similar to operations management that allows us to

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,200
manage our actual applications that were running in AWS.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,670
Now the first thing we're going to see is there's resource groups.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,360
And if you call back to that earlier clip,

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,550
we discussed how resource groups allow us to easily organize.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,380
Our resource is in our account and you'll see why that's important coming up.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,290
The next tool that we have is apt come thick now,

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,830
app config is going to allow us to create,

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,110
manage and deploy Apcom figs.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,750
To our resource is this essentially allows us to have

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,640
controlled deployments of our app.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,850
To most compute resource is in a W s like E C two Lambda or E.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,950
C s containers, for example.

18
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,120
And then our final capability within this suite is we have parameter store.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,090
Now parameter store provides us secure hierarchical

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,700
storage for secrets and data management.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,600
So, for instance, we can have user names stored as a parameter,

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,040
and then we can have that user names password as a

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,610
secured parameter that's encrypted,

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,980
and we'll explore this in depth in its own clip coming up shortly.

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,430
Now let's go ahead will break here and then when you're ready,

26
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,640
will pick back up in the next clip.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,000
We're going to start diving into the consul and exploring each of these capabilities.
