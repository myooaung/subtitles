1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,720
[Autogenerated] All right, So what does service catalog actually do?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,270
Well, there are four things that we really want to touch on here,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,940
and the first is that it allows us to provide

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,590
standardization across our products.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,640
Now, what this means is that we, as the service catalog product owners,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,760
are able to control which services inversions are

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,730
actually available for others to use.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,430
It also allows for self service discovery.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,630
And what this means is that basically different account

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,990
owners and users can deploy these services or these products

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,270
that we publish all on their own,

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,900
and they don't have to create things from scratch.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,420
They can reuse or repurpose our products to meet their needs,

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,550
and it's all done via a self service portal that the user gets the search from.

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,330
It also allows us to implement fine grained access control.

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,630
And what this means is that we, as the product owners,

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,510
are actually able to lock down the configuration of

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,550
the different available services,

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,970
the permissions in the different access based on many different specific values,

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,820
and we can do it by individual maybe ah cost centre tag

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,230
or maybe just a user group in general.

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,430
Another example, is,

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,670
we can actually locked down what type of V P sees

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,580
our products can be launched into,

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,210
and the last thing we have is that you can utilize version control now.

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,000
In today's day and age version, control is huge,

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,340
especially for infrastructure is code.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,210
So by utilizing this version control,

29
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,700
you can slowly release newer versions and publish those

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,890
for people to use all without them,

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,950
really even noticing it's a seamless integration.

32
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,180
So let's go over a quick example of how service

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,100
catalog works we have in AWS architect.

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,780
And he's designing this Jason template,

35
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,460
which is a cloud formacion template that we're going to call a

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,240
service now when he creates it and tests it,

37
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,090
he can then publish that product to service catalog.

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,740
And once it's published,

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,660
it actually gets listed in a catalogue that other users can browse.

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,580
So then we have our A W s admin is and users that come into play,

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,210
let's just say, for example, they're working for their company,

42
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,780
and they need to deploy this standard product that our AWS

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,410
architect has created in published Well,

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,740
they're going to go ahead and browse that catalog,

45
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,170
the A.

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,150
W s service catalog,

47
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,970
which is a portfolio and product list which will look out here in a little bit.

48
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,330
And they're gonna find that particular product that they want to deploy,

49
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,700
and we can see that they're deploying product A into their own accounts.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,670
Now this allows for an exact identical copy of product A in

51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,860
between account a an account be all because we're using service

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,090
catalog as that deployment point.

53
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,980
Now you can see how Service Catalog really allows us to

54
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,340
easily share services and products that we get to define for

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,850
quick deployment to other users.

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,250
Now we're gonna go ahead and wrap this clip up,

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,050
and then I'll see you in the next one where we're going to start

58
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,000
diving into the console and poking around a. W S service catalog.
