1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,040
[Autogenerated] let's begin diving into application management Now.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,910
Application management is the next set of capabilities

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,090
that systems manager allows us to use.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,820
It's a sweet if you recall from our presentation that it allows

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,140
us to manage our applications running in AWS.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,820
So the first thing we want to do is I'm gonna go over resource groups now,

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,270
under resource groups, you can see I have some defined,

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,410
and we're gonna go ahead and create our own here in a minute.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,520
But resource groups are going to allow us to organize many

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,140
different resource is within a W s all in one group,

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,110
and this is going to allow us to perform actions and automation on several.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,840
Resource is with one particular automation task.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,910
Now automation is coming up in the next section,

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,240
which is actions and change over here on the left.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,040
But resource groups are a staple for systems manager,

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,500
so it's important that you understand how they work and how

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,940
you can use them Now before we get started.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,630
Just some background here is I spun up to different buckets.

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,940
You can see ones, Devin ones prod.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,960
And then I also spun up two different instances and If we look at the tags here,

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,040
you'll see Dev and then you should see prod Perfect.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,990
So we're going to use these Resource is to demo how resource groups work.

23
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,620
So I'm gonna click on Create Resource Group and

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,870
this brings us to our group type.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,200
Now we can either search for resource is based on tags or we can

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,840
search for cloud formacion stack based tags.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,020
Now, we'll do both.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,440
But for this first go around, let's do tag based.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,470
So now that we have tagged based selected,

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,890
we go to grouping criteria and this is where we can select what type of resource

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,360
is that we want to collect and add to this resource group.

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,670
When we search, you can see there are tons of resource is in here.

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,120
So be sure to check this list out on your own time.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,150
From this case, I'm gonna do all supported types.

35
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,910
Now, let's go ahead.

36
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,030
I'm gonna give this an environment key value and then,

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,980
for the actual value of this key, you'll see it auto populated.

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,030
I'm gonna do prod.

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,790
We want a group.

40
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,170
All of our prod resource is so if we wanted to,

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,870
I could click preview and it's going to give us a group of our resource is

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,120
that belong to this resource group based on our query there.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,280
So all of these resource is right here near the bottom.

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,440
All have a tag of prod with the environment key.

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,300
So now if this looks right, we can scroll down.

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,080
We give our group of name.

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,240
We can give it a description we can give our group tags,

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,170
so this will apply tags to the resource group,

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,040
but not your actual resource is.

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
And then we can click on Create Group And there you go.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,630
It's that easy.

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,510
So we've now just created a resource group,

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,340
which has production related Resource is all in one group.

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,100
So now we can use this later on and you'll see how in upcoming clips and

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,640
we can perform automation based around these groups.

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Let's go back and let's just look at the cloud Formation Stack based group type.

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,840
So I select Cloud Formacion stack,

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,110
and then we can see the different confirmation stacks

59
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,000
within this region for our account.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,230
So these 1st 2 are my Web servers that I deployed,

61
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,040
and then the bottom two are are different buckets.

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,350
So let's just go ahead and do Dev Web, and we'll do all resource.

63
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,570
Is that air supported once again?

64
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,200
So if I preview this, you'll see we get to Resource is there's an instance.

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,870
And then there's a security group, and if I go to this instance,

66
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,310
so 71 E two is what it ends with.

67
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,760
And if I go to tags, this is what it's using right here.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,260
In order to query for this resource group,

69
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,060
this is the cloud formacion stack I d.

70
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,840
That's used when we create this group.

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,420
So if I go back,

72
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,500
that's where these two re sources are coming from so we can give this a name.

73
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,840
Now, let's do Dev Web servers.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,510
We can give it a description.

75
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm gonna click on Create Group and there we go.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,420
We now have a Dev Web Servers resource group that contains any resource

77
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,730
from that dev Cloud Information stack that I deployed.

78
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,740
So now if you go to save resource groups,

79
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,370
we can see our Devil Web servers here and then our prod web resource is So Now

80
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,070
if I go back to systems manager and I refresh this page here we're going to

81
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,210
see our new resource groups that we just created.

82
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,220
So now we can go in here quickly,

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,680
weaken view our details and this gives us all of the

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,690
details of our resource is for our group.

85
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,700
You can see there's a details pain.

86
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,440
We have config.

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,930
So if we have config rules in place, it would show their compliance.

88
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,610
Here we have our cloud trail section so we can check the different

89
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,760
events that have occurred on our resource is we can monitor it with

90
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,310
cloudwatch metrics and cloudwatch logging.

91
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,900
And then we have our ops items.

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,720
And if you recall, we went over ops items when we were in Ops Center,

93
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,010
and this is where we can go ahead and perform operational

94
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,040
related tasks specific to our resource groups.

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,770
And the last thing I want to show we're not going to

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,140
really go all the way through it, but we can execute automation.

97
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,310
So this is what I was talking about when I was discussing

98
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,490
actions and change on the left in automation.

99
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,610
Now I'm not going to do this right now.

100
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,710
Will demo this in upcoming clips,

101
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,550
but it's important to be aware that you can perform

102
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,040
automation tasks on your resource groups,

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,070
so let's go ahead that's gonna do it For resource groups,

104
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,300
it's very important that you understand how these work as they

105
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,040
are a fundamental piece of knowledge that you need in order to

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,340
properly use systems manager, at least at an efficient level.

107
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,840
There's other ways to do it, but it's not going to be the most efficient way.

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,000
So let's go ahead and wrap up here and then in the next clip, we're going to start discussing APP config.
