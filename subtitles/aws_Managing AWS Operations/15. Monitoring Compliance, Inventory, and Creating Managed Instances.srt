00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,310
[Autogenerated] Okay, Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,700
Let's dive into instances and nodes.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,750
This section is going to be broken up into several clips

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,540
because otherwise it would be a little lengthy,

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,740
and it be hard to follow after a certain time.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,620
So let's knock out a few of these capabilities in this first clip.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,290
The 1st 1 I want to talk about is compliance Now.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:29,640
Compliance allows us to scan our instances which need to be managed instances,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,840
and we'll talk about those here coming up in this clip.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,840
But we can scan these four compliance and configuration and consistency.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,770
So a collects and aggregates data for us to view from our

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,340
account and even other accounts and regions.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,380
So it allows for a central pane of glass in a central view

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,860
into what's going on in our environments.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,680
The first thing we see at the top here is we have our compliance filtering.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,910
So what do we want to see?

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,240
We can look at Type Patch Group, which will talk about here in a little while,

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,870
or even the famous resource group so you can see it pulls up our prod.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,860
Web resource is resource group in that same instance, now, in the middle here.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,940
It gives us a summary of our compliance.

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,630
So based on some config rules and some patch manager rules,

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,040
and we'll look at ST Manager and Patch manager here a little bit later on,

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,240
it scans these instances to say, Hey, are they compliant?

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,030
Are they noncompliant?

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,480
Are they critical?

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,490
High, medium, low, etcetera.

27
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,840
So they have several categories that they can fall into.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,620
Now we have one instance in its compliant,

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,720
and you could see that here at the bottom.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,640
So if I click on this, it will bring us to our managed instances tab.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,370
Now, before we dive into this, let me go back.

32
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,770
And if we select this instance here, you can see the I.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,190
D of the compliance check, the compliance type,

34
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,740
the severity which is non existent, and then some other details.

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,680
And if I click on this, this is going to bring us to state manager.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
Now, don't worry about this yet.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,410
We'll talk about it here in the upcoming clips,

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,190
but I wanted to show you how you can get there very quickly

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,270
and what it relates to or what it's referring to when you see

40
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,090
that I d let me close this out.

41
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll go back to my compliance screen.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,930
And when we click this instance, it brings us to our managed instant screen.

43
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,240
So this is a good jump point in to manage instances.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:44,340
Now, manage instances are machines configured for use with systems manager.

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,660
So they have the s s M agent running on them,

46
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,610
which is required, and they're connecting toe S s M and reporting status.

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,960
So this instance here D six FD one.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,740
If I go to this instance,

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,970
you'll see I have a role associated with it easy to S s M user.

50
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,600
So this is very important.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,070
Your role has to have permissions,

52
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,670
assuming you're using easy to so that it can successfully be

53
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,970
granted authorisation to access systems manager.

54
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,570
Now, I set this one up with way too many permissions,

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,050
but this was easier just to show you do not set it

56
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,310
up for Amazon S S m full access.

57
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,100
If you do not need to follow the principle of least privilege.

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,840
So with that role assigned to this instance here,

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,940
that's what's allowing us toe essentially have an online status.

60
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,590
It reports the different attributes of this instance,

61
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,820
and it gives us shortcuts to the instance and configure ALS.

62
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,010
Now,

63
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,120
a neat feature here is we can actually auto update

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,380
that S s m agent on these instances, if we wanted to,

65
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,540
I won't do that here, but this is very handy.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,930
So now if I go into here and I've you are managed instance

67
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,010
you can see we get our descriptions.

68
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,940
It gives some attributes that we configured.

69
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,430
We'll skip inventory really quickly.

70
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,050
You can see we can view our tags, the associations,

71
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,850
which is what we just looked at when we checked out state manager.

72
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,620
And again, we'll talk about that coming up.

73
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,510
There's patch.

74
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,660
So what kind of patches and updates are installed and

75
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,240
needed in which ones aired out?

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,540
I haven't done any patching yet, so we don't see any.

77
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,060
And then we have configuration compliance, so isn't compliant or not.

78
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,340
And when was the last check?

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,930
Now let's jump back here to inventory,

80
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,490
and this is going to jump to our next in last capability

81
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,540
of this clip the inventory capability.

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,350
You'll see that we can collect inventory of our instances so we

83
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,600
can see what's installed and you'll see there are tons of

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,640
capabilities and options that we can choose.

85
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,990
We can see a W West components.

86
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,140
And here's the S S M agent.

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,680
We can even view network interfaces all from this one dashboard.

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,830
This is an awesome capability that systems Manager

89
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,340
provides for operational management.

90
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,370
If this was a Windows instance,

91
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:26,300
we could view the registry details for the registry on that instance.

92
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,930
It's really sweet.

93
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,080
So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and go over here to inventory.

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,740
And let's just talk about this really quickly.

95
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,880
Now, when you get here, you'd have to set up your inventory.

96
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,460
So let's just act like we're gonna do that here.

97
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,080
I would give it a name we can specify are targets,

98
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,300
so weaken select all managed instances.

99
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,440
You can specify a tag, or you can manually select him from a instance picker.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,290
Now I'll do all we define a schedule.

101
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,720
So how often do we collect data?

102
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,240
And currently, 30 minutes is the lowest you can go, so I'll leave that at 30.

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,310
But if we wanted to, you can see weaken,

104
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,840
specify several days or if we wanted to every so many hours.

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Now I'll do minutes and then let's check out these parameters.

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,420
So this is where if we look back and managed

107
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,400
instances here and I go to inventory, this is where all of these air coming from.

108
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,850
So in inventory, we would define what we want to collect.

109
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,320
Now, let's just assume I'm only working with Lennox instances,

110
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,240
So I'm gonna get rid of all of these windows specific components and parameters,

111
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,020
so I'll leave the other stuff.

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,890
You can see we can sink our inventory logs to an S three

113
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,700
bucket for compliance and auditing.

114
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,490
So if I wanted to, I can enter a bucket,

115
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,010
name and prefix to store these execution logs,

116
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,770
and then I would click set up inventory.

117
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,610
Now, I've already done this, so I'm gonna cancel out.

118
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,540
I'll go back to inventory, and after your data is collected,

119
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,980
this is what you would see.

120
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,620
Something similar to this you can see we have are managed

121
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,410
instances that show which ones have inventory enabled.

122
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,790
It shows our components that were collecting the different applications,

123
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,800
etcetera, etcetera.

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,480
So it's showing us all of those different parameters that we specified.

125
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,510
Now, if I go to detailed view,

126
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,080
this is where we can use a little bit more complex data.

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,580
Analytic tools like a FINA and glue to perform data sinks on our instance types.

128
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,320
Now let's just go ahead and go through this.

129
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,690
I'm not going to create one, but we would give it a name.

130
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,770
We would type the bucket that we want.

131
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,670
We would do a prefix if we wanted to specify which region

132
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,270
that buckets in and then we can encrypt.

133
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,140
This is, well, we would create it.

134
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,600
And then we could have a resource Data Sync set up so we can

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,050
view inventory data from multiple sources.

136
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,260
Now,

137
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,630
last thing before we wrap up this settings now settings is

138
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,600
where we can view our inventory associations.

139
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,800
So the one we just created today is right here,

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,480
and you can see the different description and attributes that go along with it.

141
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,870
There's a description.

142
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,980
There's resource is our parameters that we specified targets,

143
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:33,120
versions and execution history, and you'll notice when we followed this I d.

144
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
We ended up in state manager,

145
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,810
so I'm not going to cover any more of state manager in this clip.

146
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,670
Let's go ahead.

147
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:46,000
This is a good breaking point in the next clip will pick up with hybrid activations
