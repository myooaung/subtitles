00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.960
[Autogenerated] Okay, Welcome.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.760
Now, in this clip, we're going to start looking at encryption for s three.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.940
So by default, this bucket is not encrypted,

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.780
and I'll actually show you how to enable that here in a minute.

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.520
But for now, let's look at manually enabling encryption on an object.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.490
So what I'm gonna do here,

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.310
select this object and you can see over here on the right that

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.520
encryption is set to none within the properties.

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.880
So I actually want to encrypt this.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.490
So I'm gonna select this.

11
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.040
Which brings us to our properties menu for our object here.

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.590
And I'm gonna select encryption and you can see we have two

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.330
different options outside of doing none,

14
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.680
we can do A s to 56 which is Amazon s three service side encryption.

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.950
So if I select that,

16
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.390
that's gonna use a W s version ing of encryption for our data,

17
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.170
or I can specify kms,

18
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.320
so I can essentially select a key from my account to

19
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.350
use for encrypting these objects.

20
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.410
So for this clip,

21
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.510
I'm just gonna go and choose the default of the S three service side

22
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.820
encryption and click on Save here in our object is encrypted using a es 2 56

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.360
So if I go back here and I select this object again,

24
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.250
you can see that our encryption has now changed to that update of value.

25
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.740
So now, at rest, this object here is encrypted using that protocol.

26
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.600
Well, that's great.

27
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.770
But how do we do it at a default level?

28
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.680
We don't wanna have to go through retroactively and update all of our

29
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.240
encryption for files that may not be encrypted.

30
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.310
Well, that's pretty easy.

31
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.720
We can go up here to properties and you can see there's actually a

32
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.510
default encryption section here that's offered.

33
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.360
So I'm gonna click on this and we get the same options as before

34
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870
when we were looking at that specific object.

35
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.280
Now, on this one, let me go and choose Kms,

36
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.330
and I'm gonna choose the default key, which is a W S s three.

37
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.480
So this is a kms key created by AWS for the S three service.

38
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.730
Now,

39
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.320
another nifty little feature here that you can incorporate is a bucket policy.

40
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.170
So they actually give you a warning that bucket policies are

41
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.290
applied before encryption settings are, and they show here that hey,

42
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.980
if you have encryption enabled by default,

43
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.500
but you have put requests being denied.

44
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.340
If they're not encrypted with the original upload,

45
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.290
then that's gonna fall in the place first.

46
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.520
The objects not gonna be uploaded because that

47
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.880
bucket policy gets executed first.

48
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.080
Now,

49
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.970
another cool thing here is you can actually go ahead and

50
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.200
require that objects be encrypted as well if you don't

51
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.930
have default encryption enabled.

52
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.890
But we don't have to worry about that because we're

53
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.500
enabling default encryption here.

54
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.080
Now I'm gonna click on Save.

55
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.850
So now if I upload another object to this bucket here and let me

56
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.350
go toe overview and let me upload a new file.

57
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.850
There we go.

58
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.750
So I just uploaded a new file with the default settings

59
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.600
here and let's go and take a look.

60
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.300
I didn't specify explicitly the kms or encryption standards,

61
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.180
so let me select this file and you're going to see that hate by

62
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.760
default now are encryption has taken place.

63
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.000
It's using AWS Kms to encrypt this file or object upon upload.

64
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.140
So even though I didn't specify it, I just used the default settings.

65
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.860
It's automatically applied because we have this enabled at the bucket level now.

66
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.050
One quick caveat.

67
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.240
Whenever you're using a W s K.

68
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.200
M s for any of your encryption standards within your buckets,

69
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.580
you need to realize each time it's encrypted and decrypted,

70
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.650
you're going to get billed for that particular kms ap I action,

71
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.320
whether it be encrypt or decrypt.

72
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.930
So just keep that in mind.

73
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.840
And with that, we're gonna go and wrap this clip up,

74
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.000
and we're gonna move on to the next one where we're going to start working with life cycle rules within Amazon s three.
