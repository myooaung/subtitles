1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,210
[Autogenerated] cool.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,140
Let's dive in tow actions and change.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,390
So with our overview, we just had we discussed it.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,960
How the Actions in Change section provides capabilities for

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,840
us to take actions on our AWS re sources.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,000
Now the first capability I want to talk about is automation.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,220
Now automation allows us to simplify common tasks revolving

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,810
around R E C two and other AWS re sources.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,230
Now there is flexible as performing one off tasks like creating a snapshot.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,810
Or you can develop your own complex work flows to

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,040
perform these automation tasks.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,430
This automation capability really allows teams to free up a

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,010
lot of their time by automating all of the tedious tasks

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,840
that they normally complete.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,940
So let's just explore this here really quickly.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,180
I go to execute automation.

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,610
This brings us to our choose documents screen.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,340
Now we'll talk about documents in depth a little bit later on,

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,130
but for now we'll just walk through this process so you

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,830
can see how automation works Now.

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,920
The first thing you might notice is that we have four tabs currently available.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
We can filter by owned by a Mazon owned by me,

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,790
shared with me or all documents so If we go toe owned by Amazon,

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,080
you'll see that they have their own categories listed here on the left.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,900
And these all fall under a main or common ops related task

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,220
that you might complete like E C two tasks.

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,540
There's patching tasks or even am I management.

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,450
Now what I want to do,

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,270
just for the sake of this demo is I want to go to

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,520
create image some a select AWS, create image,

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,380
and you'll see it populates our document details.

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,220
Here at the bottom, we see our name, the description,

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,760
and then we have our version selection.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,740
Now it goes to default, which makes sense.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,090
But you can also specify latest or you can specify a specific version.

36
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,870
If there were multiple and again,

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,690
we'll dig into this a little bit deeper coming up when we

38
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,600
talk about documents over here on the left,

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,460
so I'll leave it at default.

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm gonna click on next, and this brings us to our execution phase.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,450
So do we want a simple execution where we just execute on specific targets?

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,230
Do we want to rate control it so we can execute these tasks on multiple targets?

43
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,470
But we can limit the concurrency.

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,140
So based on how many targets we want to do it once or a percentage,

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,790
as you can see down here,

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,800
we can control granular early How many executions we want to

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,170
take place so we can limit toe one at a time.

48
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,140
We can do 50% of the targets at a time,

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,280
and we can specify our error thresholds now.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,820
The next option is multi account and region,

51
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,640
so this does exactly what it sounds like.

52
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,270
It allows us to execute our automation tasks and

53
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,790
multiple accounts and multiple regions.

54
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,990
But we can do so from one central location.

55
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,200
You'll see when we select this option,

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,490
we get this target accounts in regions section that we can fill out.

57
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,350
So what we can do is specify account I ds or an O.

58
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,280
U I d.

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,540
From an organization we can specify are regions.

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,680
We defined the automation execution roll and then

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,980
we can add more or remove them.

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,140
Now,

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,720
you also see we have an optional ray control so we can do

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,120
the same thing where we can limit the number of targets

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
that are being executed on.

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,940
And we can also set an error threshold.

67
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,800
So this would allow us to essentially deploy to an entire

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,140
organizational unit if we wanted to, with one task.

69
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,740
And then the last one we see is manual execution.

70
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,970
So this is where we go ahead and manually specify all of

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,670
the settings and the steps one by one.

72
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,050
For the sake of longevity.

73
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,490
In this demo, I'm gonna pick simple execution,

74
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,940
and you can see we have input parameters that I need to fill out.

75
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,920
So we need to pick the instance I d of the EEC two

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,840
instance that we want to make an image of.

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,570
So if you have them already in a list somewhere,

78
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,540
you can populate this string here.

79
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,210
Or you can toggle this little interactive picker so you'll see

80
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,750
that we have one instance running right now.

81
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,730
I'm gonna select that instance and you can see it's

82
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,500
populated now at the top of this little section and then

83
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,720
we have a couple more parameters.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,070
We have no reboot.

85
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,910
So if we want, we can skip the reboot phase of creating an image.

86
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,930
And if we set true, that means no reboot will occur.

87
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,470
So let's go ahead and do that now and then we specify our

88
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,510
role that we want this automation to assume.

89
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,660
Now I'm gonna select one that was set up previously.

90
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,450
And then you can also see that we can specify tags.

91
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,740
So weaken group in filter our results.

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,900
Now, one last thing before we execute this is if you open up the Seelye section,

93
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,420
it gives you the command that's needed in order to execute this.

94
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,610
So if I wanted to, I could do see a lie,

95
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,440
and it auto populates this information for me.

96
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,340
This is a neat little feature, and it's often overlooked.

97
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,300
So I'm gonna go ahead.

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,970
I'm gonna click on execute and you'll notice I actually get a failed status.

99
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,540
And I'm guessing this is gonna be because of some permissions.

100
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,500
So if I go in here to the step, i d.

101
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,620
Where it failed, There we go.

102
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:51,930
Yep.

103
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,360
It cannot create the image.

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,700
So let me really quickly.

105
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm gonna pause this clip, and then once I edit, my role will resume.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,490
Okay, So I edited my role and gave it easy to permissions.

107
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,860
Let's go ahead and I want to rerun this execution,

108
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,910
so I'm gonna go back to automation.

109
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,410
We're going to select execute again.

110
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,150
I'm gonna choose the same document,

111
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,590
and I'll fill in the exact same information as we did before.

112
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,010
So instance I d.

113
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,080
We set this to true and I'm gonna pick that same rule.

114
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Now click on Execute, and we'll see that it's pending now.

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,940
So what I'll do is I'll refresh a couple of times and

116
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,990
I'll go ahead and pause the clip here.

117
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,560
Once again, we'll let this run and when it's done,

118
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,000
will resume and we'll dive into it.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,560
Okay, so that took a couple of minutes.

120
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,180
But you can see we have a success status now.

121
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,600
It took the create image action.

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,060
And then there's a step name and once again will dissect

123
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,590
these a little bit deeper later on.

124
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,780
But if you notice, we can check the input that we provided and the output.

125
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,980
So what it did is it gave us the image I d.

126
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,590
That was created from this step.

127
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,140
So now if I go too easy too and I load the AM eyes,

128
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,030
I should see this am I here and there you go.

129
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,750
Right there.

130
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,380
I dio so 5445 5445 So it is the I D.

131
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,980
That was just created,

132
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,800
and you'll see that it automatically created in AM I name for us as well,

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,120
and we'll discuss how this was done here later on.

134
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,230
So that's how you can execute an automation with a

135
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,510
simple Siris of clicks or a CLI command.

136
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,980
This allowed us with the click of a button to shut an image down,

137
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,670
snapshot an image or create an image from it.

138
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,820
Name that image and make it available,

139
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,140
and then reboot that server back up and make sure that it comes up successfully.

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, when we get into the shared resource is section of this course,

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,440
you're going to see the amount of tasks that you can perform and

142
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,640
how you can use this in your own daily work.

143
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,560
It really opens up the door for a lot of automation for tasks,

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,020
so you can free your time up to do something a little bit bigger and

145
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,140
better outside of patching and operational tasks.

146
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,340
So with that, we're going to go ahead and wrap up this automation section.

147
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:32,000
When we picked back up in the next clip, we're going to start looking at change calendar and maintenance windows
