00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,340
Welcome to this last informational clip within this second module.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,140
Now, in this clip, we're going to start looking at I am best practices.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,940
Now I imagine you're already pretty familiar with I am,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,900
but we just want to do a quick review on some of the best

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,120
practices to really ensure that our account is going to be

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,640
compliant and as secure as possible.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,000
Now,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,820
the first main thing is obviously I am is the core service for all

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,930
access control and authentication for our AWS accounts.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,010
Everything starts with I am essentially whenever were interacting.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,550
Now the next is a list of some key best practices,

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,900
and the 1st 1 is to always enable M f A,

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,230
especially on the root account, and then lock away your credentials for route.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,040
If you can.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,710
A lot of teams will take this.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,270
They'll enable M f A and then take their credentials for root and lock it in a

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,260
safe somewhere where only certain individuals can access it.

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,430
The next is to always take your least privilege approach,

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,910
so only give out what is actually needed.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,040
Don't give too many permissions.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,430
You always want to utilize roles for delegating permissions,

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,690
so avoid using static users whenever possible.

24
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,370
And then, if you do have static credentials,

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,850
be sure to regularly rotate those now it's actually

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,130
recommended to rotate every 90 days or so.

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,960
And then the last point I want to touch on is that you should always use

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,740
managed policies instead of in line whenever possible.

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,140
And this is really for tracking purposes.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,310
More than anything,

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,870
you can control these managed policies a lot easier than in line policies,

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,910
and the last note here is obviously understanding I am is extremely important.

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,620
So I do recommend you deep dive into I am whenever you get the time.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,010
So let's go ahead and look at I am Indy Consul itself.

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,680
Now you can see I'm at the I am screen and this is

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,350
the default dashboard that we get,

37
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,350
and I'm really just gonna show you a few quick things.

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,920
The first thing is the security status here on the middle of the page,

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,520
you can see that we have activated MF A on our route account.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,440
We created an individual user to log in as we used groups,

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,550
and then we applied a password policy,

42
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,500
so these air the 1st 4 steps that AWS really recommends when we

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,860
first get in that I am now to set some of these.

44
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,140
We really want to go to account settings here,

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,090
and this loads air password policy.

46
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,000
So this is where we're going to specify are different minimum

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,610
requirements for passwords for our static users.

48
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,520
And it gets pretty detailed weaken set different requirements

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,030
for a password itself when they can change it,

50
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,410
or if they're allowed to.

51
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,140
And how many of the last ones are remembered that they cannot use.

52
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,490
And then another little nifty feature here is at the bottom.

53
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,010
We can actually disable security token service per region.

54
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,230
So I deactivated everything outside of the U.

55
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,550
S.

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,030
Because I'll never use it.

57
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,440
And I can always be sure that I only ever have STS active in the U.

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,900
S.

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,780
Regions.

60
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:58,940
Now,

61
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,200
the very last thing I want to show you with this before we

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,510
wrap this up is this credential report.

63
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,850
So what this does is it allows us to download a report of all the accounts,

64
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,570
users and the status of their credentials.

65
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,940
So I already downloaded one of these and let's take a look at what it looks

66
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,140
like now we can see here we have a root account here,

67
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,260
and as you can see, we can see our first user is our route account.

68
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,900
And then we have me and it shows a few different properties.

69
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,110
We can see our user creation time are password enabled,

70
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,810
which is either true or false.

71
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,830
When it was last used, Last changed.

72
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,070
We can see if M f.

73
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,940
A is active if our access keys air active and it actually

74
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,380
shows on both pairs of access keys, which is really nice.

75
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,270
And then if I scroll all the way to the end,

76
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,270
we can see if we had Certs active for authentication,

77
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,680
they would show up here as well.

78
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,000
So this is a very handy report that you can use to quickly view the

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,340
status of different credentials within your AWS account.

80
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,330
Now that's gonna do it for this clip on.

81
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,040
I am best practices.

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,000
We're going to wrap it up and I'll see you in the next one. We're gonna have a summary in an overview of what we all discussed
