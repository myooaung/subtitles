1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,950
[Autogenerated] Okay, here we go.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,480
So I've loaded up the service catalogue service screen within the AWS console,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,600
and you can see it brings us to this getting started page.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,070
Now, if I scroll down,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,440
we'll see a get started button will click that here in a second.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,340
But if I continue,

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,320
we're going to see we have three different options here where we can learn more.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,840
We can learn more about creating and managing portfolios.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,550
We can learn about adding products,

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,910
and we can even learn about managing user access and then at the bottom.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,100
Here we have our documentation links.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,240
Now,

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,090
I do recommend you dive into these documentation links

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,850
because service catalog can get very detailed.

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,840
But for now, let's go and scroll back up and I'm gonna click on get started.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,280
Now, you see,

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,680
that brings us to a create portfolio screen and AWS

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,930
lists that we can use portfolios toe,

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,360
organize our products and then distribute them.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,390
Now, portfolios contain products,

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,010
and we actually grant permissions for users to view and launch these

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,360
products that are contained within these portfolios.

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,010
So I'm gonna give my portfolio and name.

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm gonna call it plural site and then if we want,

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,250
we can give it a description saw.

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,940
Go and say this is our test portfolio.

27
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,460
And then the owner is whoever you want to be indicated as creating it.

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,880
So Uggla and put myself as the owner.

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,430
All right, so we have everything filled out.

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,910
We gave it a name, a description in an owner.

31
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,350
So I'm gonna click on Create.

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,640
Now, this is going to create our very first portfolio.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,950
Now, from this portfolios view here,

34
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,740
we can see at the top that we can select the portfolio source.

35
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,260
We could do local ones, weaken, do imported weaken, do organization portfolios.

36
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,030
Or we can do a getting started library.

37
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,730
So let's click on that and you can see that AWS

38
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,570
provides us a service catalog in a box.

39
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,420
So if we open this here, we're going to see in a ws provided sample for us use.

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,000
And you can see all of the different product names

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,610
that they have published in here.

42
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,850
So these air pretty much different cloud formacion templates that we

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,160
can go ahead and publish within our own account.

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,200
So I'm gonna go back here.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm gonna return to portfolio list, will make sure on local portfolios.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,070
And then I'm gonna go down to our new portfolio plural site.

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,400
Let me open this up and it takes us to our portfolio screen.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,560
Now,

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
the first thing we're going to see here is that we do not

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,290
have any products in this portfolio, so we need to start adding some.

51
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,490
So what we can do here is we can either upload a new

52
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,470
product or we can add an existing product to our portfolio

53
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,250
so we don't have any existing ones.

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,530
So I'm gonna click on upload new product here,

55
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,220
and let's give this a product name.

56
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm gonna call it plural site product.

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,560
And then in the description here,

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,800
let's just put something simple and then provided by is gonna be

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,680
the person or organization that's publishing it.

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,280
So I go and put my name again here, and then we'll move on.

61
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,470
We'll see the vendor, which is an optional field.

62
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,890
So I'm gonna leave this blank.

63
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,380
But if we were a vendor that's publishing this,

64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,720
we can put our name here, so I'm gonna click on next,

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,510
and then we enter our support details.

66
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,990
So this is going to be who is going to provide support

67
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,880
for our product that we're posting.

68
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,000
So I'm gonna enter my email address here,

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,900
and then we're gonna move on to support Link.

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,160
Now, if we had a link a u r l that we wanted to provide for support,

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,260
we could put that here.

72
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,140
We don't have one, so we'll leave it blank.

73
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,070
But in the description will put plural sites support.

74
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,910
All right, there we go.

75
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,680
So we now have my email contact.

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,410
We're not using a support link, and then we provided this simple description,

77
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,800
so I'm gonna click on next again.

78
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,040
Let me scroll down here on version details,

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,560
and you're going to see weaken, select the template location.

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,900
We can either upload one or weaken.

81
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,450
Specify a your location that stores a confirmation template.

82
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,360
So what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna upload a local file here,

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,660
so let me select this.

84
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,030
Okay, so I've uploaded it, and it's called service catalog product,

85
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,740
and then I'm gonna give it a title.

86
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,040
So we'll just call this the initial version and then if we wanted to,

87
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,080
we can also give it a description.

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,750
And you can see that AWS recommends the description explicitly

89
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,240
call out the differences between versions.

90
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,710
So let's just put a simple description for this,

91
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,340
and then I'm gonna going click on next, all right?

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,690
And this brings us to our product reviews screen.

93
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,070
We can see our product details.

94
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,150
Here we can see are optional product information.

95
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,550
And then when I scroll down here, we can see our version details.

96
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,780
So it uploaded our cloud information template to an S three bucket here,

97
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,810
and it has our version title in description.

98
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,550
So what I'm gonna do is click on create, and there we go a success.

99
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,410
We've now added a product to our portfolio.

100
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,470
So I'm gonna close this window down the success message,

101
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,340
and I'm actually gonna go ahead and refresh this page here and there we go.

102
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,650
We see our plural site product that we just uploaded.

103
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,670
So we're going to go in and wrap this initial clip up where we just got done,

104
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,420
creating an up, loading a new product, and then in the next clip,

105
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,380
we're actually gonna start diving into the

106
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,610
different options that come with this.

107
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,000
Such as the constraints and sharing with other accounts. So we'll wrap this one up and then I'll see you in the next one
