[Autogenerated] Okay,

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,520
welcome to this clip where we're going to start diving into Amazon,

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,430
Inspector.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,660
Now,

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,440
Amazon Inspector is a tool in service that's offered by AWS to

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,190
allow us to perform several different functions that help us

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,510
maintain this strict security posture as well as meet compliance

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,140
standards and requirements.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,530
Now, the first thing it lets us do is perform active auditing.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,680
So we're gonna be able to actively monitor in audit our

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,060
current AWS resource is and then, if needed,

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,020
to alert on any violations.

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,590
The next thing that it allows us to do is identify applications security issues.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,410
So if we're missing some patches for some operating system

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,730
packages that we might have installed,

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,180
we're gonna be able to identify and act on those different issues.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,600
It also allows us to gain a better understanding of our resource is as a whole.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,180
With this insight,

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,950
we're going to be able to truly understand what's going on within our resource

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,390
is such as those missing security patches or some type of auditing or maybe

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,470
some type of malicious software that we might have installed on our resource

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,620
is specifically are easy to instances.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,740
The next thing it allows us to do is to really work with

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,490
configuration scanning and monitoring.

25
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:24,620
So if some of our ec2 resource is don't meet our standard for our configuration,

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,270
we're going to be able to scan in,

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,620
monitor and pick up on things that are violations.

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:30,840
Now.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,450
It also comes with a built in content library.

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,400
And what this means is they provide certain baselines for us to use.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,350
When we're running them against our temple,

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,180
it'd targets, and we'll discuss what that means here in a moment.

33
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,140
And then the last big benefit is that we can automate everything

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,660
via an A p I so we can perform a P I calls to automate our scanning

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:59,000
in configuration monitoring processes. So let's actually go ahead and check out Amazon Inspector in the console.
