00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.110
[Autogenerated] Okay, Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.760
Now we just got done exploring the explore capability here,

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.610
and let's dive into Ops Center.

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.700
So under the same operations management,

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.380
we have ops center here, and Op Center is going to allow us a central location.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.230
Where are different?

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.740
Engineers can come in and resolve or different items.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.040
So using Explorer, which we looked at in partnership with Ops Center,

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.440
we can start resolving items.

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.740
Now.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.420
We don't have any that are open or in progress,

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.080
because I have literally one instance running.

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.320
So there's not a lot of opportunity for ops related items,

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.140
but you can see they have a nice little dashboard for a quick viewing.

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.730
We have our status summary.

16
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.240
So what we have open and in progress.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.650
We have sources with the most open items,

18
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.690
and then we have a ops item list by source and age,

19
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.480
and you can see they have 0 30 days, 31 in 90 days and then greater than 90.

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.360
So if we had some items in here,

21
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.480
we would see them in order and start being able to resolve them as needed.

22
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.900
Now you can also see weaken view resolved ones.

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.070
So if we resolve them.

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.240
They go to this resolved view,

25
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.210
and these issues in here are going to be things like

26
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.890
security issues from security hub,

27
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.810
maybe some type of Degra gated performance for your

28
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.740
volumes on your E c two instances,

29
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.490
or maybe even an alert where some of your E C two instances

30
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.940
shut down and you don't want them to, like,

31
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.300
maybe, say, a domain controller that needs to be up at all times.

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.410
If it shuts down,

33
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.440
you can have an ops item for that that could be acted on within Ops Center.

34
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.490
So this is a very powerful tool to use in conjunction with Explorer.

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.040
Now, if we open up ops items here, this is where we can create a new ops item.

36
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.650
So let's go ahead and click this and let's check this out so we give it a title.

37
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.180
I'll just call this test.

38
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.120
We give it a source.

39
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.380
So information about the item origin so I'll just go ahead and do test source.

40
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.640
We can specify a priority here, and by specifying part authorities,

41
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.230
it allows us to quickly identify higher priority ops items,

42
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.730
then lower ones.

43
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.200
We can specify a severity here, so critical toe low, we can define a category.

44
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.040
So what does this fall under cost security, etcetera.

45
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.040
We give a description.

46
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.670
We can do a D duplication string which essentially allows us to avoid

47
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.400
creating duplicate ops items within our systems manager account.

48
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.410
So what happens is systems manager will check within ops

49
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.420
Center when you're creating a new ops item,

50
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.250
and it will see if this de dupe string already exists when

51
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.230
you're defining a another one and if it does,

52
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.650
it won't create it.

53
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.890
And then the last thing we have here is notifications,

54
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.320
so we can publish notifications to a subscription

55
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.340
whenever these ops items come into play.

56
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.660
Now,

57
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.680
what we would do is we would add a related resource here so I can scroll down

58
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.380
here and you can see there are several different resource is.

59
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.610
So if I just do instance I don't have an i d.

60
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.220
But we could enter our instance I d.

61
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.710
And then add that to this ops item and then create it.

62
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.250
And once that's created,

63
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.350
it will allow us to monitor and act on those items

64
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.590
whenever issues come up that need resolution.

65
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.650
So that would go ahead and do it well in this.

66
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.000
Op centers talk here, and then in the next clip,

67
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we're going to discuss cloudwatch dashboards and trusted advisor in personal Health Dashboard.
