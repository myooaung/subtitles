00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,920
[Autogenerated] all right in this clip.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,710
Let's go ahead and take a look at some constraints.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,990
Now constraints, which are in this drop down menu,

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,550
where on the left are essentially,

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,540
are a way to control the way our products can be launched by different users.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,180
And you can see right now we don't have any defined constraints.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,320
And another caveat is that your portfolio must first contain a

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,220
product which it does appear our plural site product.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,060
So let's go ahead and look at these constraints here.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,660
If I click on add constraints, we can see we get a constraint type list.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,000
We can use the launch constraint type,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,980
which is going to assign an I am rule for our cloud

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,920
formacion to use what provisions resource is.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,580
We can set a notification tight,

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,400
which is going to stream product notifications to a specific topic.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,920
On our end, we can do a template constraint,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,480
which is gonna limit the options available to our in users.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,030
They added a stack set, which is a beta template that was recently added,

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,790
and it allows us to configure these deployments across

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,290
accounts in regions using cloud formations,

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,130
stack sets, and then finally we have tag update,

22
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,840
which is going to update our tags after it has been provisioned.

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,810
So what I'm gonna do is select our product here.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,020
We only have one.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,180
And let's just do a launch constraint type.

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,680
We're not gonna dig into all of these.

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,510
I just want you to get familiar with creating them in general.

28
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,860
So I'm gonna click on launch here.

29
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,320
Let's click.

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,150
Continue.

31
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,640
And it now brings us to our launch constraint screen.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,870
So this is where we can select our role that clot information is going to use.

33
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,810
So let me find one real quick and I actually have a specific

34
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,220
role for this called Plural Sites Service catalog and you

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,310
can see the role are in here, and then I can give it a description.

36
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,280
So if I want,

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,180
I can give a simple description that talks about what

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,990
restrictions are in place or what constraints.

39
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,830
So now that we have are simple description here we click on submit.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,340
There we go.

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,520
We now have a new constraint,

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,710
created something close this little green box here and we can

43
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,190
see we have our constraint listed in our list,

44
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,410
and it's a launch type of constraint.

45
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,790
So now any time someone launches our product,

46
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,180
this constraint is going to go into effect,

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,790
and it's only going to be able to use our role that we have in

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,430
our account when we're deploying our services.

49
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,320
So now if we wanted to weaken, either edit this or we can remove it,

50
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,670
so I'm going to remove it, and now we have no constraints,

51
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,500
and that's actually gonna wrap this clip up.

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,240
I'll see you in the next one where we're going to start

53
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:29,000
diving into assigning permissions to other users or roles and even other AWS accounts.
