[Autogenerated] All right, So now that you're done with actions and change,

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.260
let's actually dive into instances and notes.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.040
Now for this,

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.310
we're not gonna have a deep presentation because

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.770
there's a massive amount of services.

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.530
But just for a high level, we're gonna look at inventory config compliance.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.490
We're going to use session manager, which is a very handy tool,

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.930
and we're gonna look at many,

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.630
many more capabilities offered within this suite of tools.

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.850
Now you'll notice when we swap to the consul here coming up,

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.290
there's going to be a ton of services,

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.470
and I'll touch on each of them at minimum at a high level and

13
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.330
will try and dive into a Zeman E as we can.

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.240
So let's go ahead.

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:52.000
Wrap up this demo overview on exploring instances and nodes and let's start getting our hands dirty and diving into the consul
