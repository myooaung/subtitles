00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.360
[Autogenerated] All right.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.930
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.070
Now.

4
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.240
We just got done discussing the AWS storage classes that are offered to us.

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.050
Now the next thing we're going to look into is version ing.

6
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.970
So let me open up my demo one bucket here and I'm

7
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.840
actually going to go to the property screen.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.180
And you can see we actually have version ing as one of the options.

9
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.040
So let me select this, and I'm going to enable version ing.

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.720
So once I save this,

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
we now are going to have multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.420
Now,

13
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.750
what this means is that if I go ahead and upload or

14
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.850
overwrite this existing object, we're going to have two versions.

15
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.450
So let me go and do that now.

16
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.820
Okay,

17
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.180
so I've updated it just now and really quick noticed that the

18
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.340
storage class has now gone to standard with this new object because

19
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.790
I uploaded it with the default settings.

20
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.670
So it used to be one zone infrequently accessed.

21
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.950
But now it's standard.

22
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.180
And if we want to, we can actually show the versions using this toggle appears.

23
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.560
So let me click on show and there we go.

24
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.710
We can see the latest version, which is the one I uploaded.

25
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.870
And then the original version that was uploaded just a few minutes before.

26
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.210
And you can see over here on the right that our

27
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.360
storage classes have been identified.

28
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.520
__________.

29
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.130
Now, a nifty feature here.

30
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.620
If I go back and I hide these versions,

31
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.000
if I go ahead and select this and delete it,

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.300
that also creates a new version.

33
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.170
It just creates a delete marker.

34
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.810
So let me delete this file and let me go to show versions.

35
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.450
And there you go.

36
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.560
We can see we have a delete marker.

37
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.430
So if I wanted to, this allows us to go ahead and restore our file.

38
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.700
So what I would do is select this delete marker.

39
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.090
I goto actions, and I would actually go and delete the actual delete marker.

40
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.240
So when I do that here, if I go back to the main screen,

41
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.380
we now have our object restored.

42
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.480
So this is a way to essentially protect your files from

43
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.040
getting truly erased and over written.

44
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.290
Now,

45
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.310
an important thing to keep in mind here is that you are

46
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.940
paying for each version within this bucket.

47
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.140
So in this case I'm paying for an object,

48
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.230
which is this current version that's in standard storage class.

49
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.840
And then I'm also paying for the original version that's in one's own,

50
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.640
infrequently accessed.

51
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.620
So I'm getting billed for two objects because it's two versions right now.

52
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.430
Now that's gonna do it for this clip on version ing and s three.

53
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.000
I'll see you in the next one where we're going to start diving into encryption within our S three buckets.
