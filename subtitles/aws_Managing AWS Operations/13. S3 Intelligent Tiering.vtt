00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.560
[Autogenerated] All right, let's go and get started in this clip,

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.850
we're gonna look at utilising intelligent tearing

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.250
for storage class within s three.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.290
So intelligent hearing is going to allow us to utilize s

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.860
three machine learning to automate the movement between

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.340
storage classes for certain objects.

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.430
So let me go and show you how you would go ahead and configure this.

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.070
I'm gonna upload a new object here,

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.240
So let me add a file and you can see I'm uploading a PNG

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.680
So a picture Let me click on next year.

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.210
I'm gonna go through next again,

12
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.150
and then we come to our storage class screen again and you can see

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.640
underneath standard we have intelligent tearing.

14
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.020
So this is for our long live data that's going to be changing

15
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.610
constantly as faras access patterns go.

16
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.960
Or maybe we just don't know what kind of access is going to be needed.

17
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.210
So we're gonna leverage S three to do some learning and

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.840
some intelligent shifting on our behalf.

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.230
And you can see there's a per object fee that goes along with this

20
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.810
and this is documented in the AWS White Papers.

21
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.970
So what we do now is to select next here,

22
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.420
and then I'm gonna click on upload, and there we go.

23
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.440
We now have our new object set toe intelligent hearing.

24
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.760
So now what this is going to do is it's going to allow as three to determine

25
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.010
what kind of storage this should be in on the back end.

26
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.880
So if it's constantly accessed,

27
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.230
it's probably going to stay in a storage class of standard.

28
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.160
But if it's hardly ever access, they might shift it too infrequently,

29
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.270
accessed to save on money.

30
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
So it's a smart tool to use If you're unsure about how

31
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.520
common certain objects are going to be now that does it for

32
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.280
this clip on intelligent hearing.

33
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.200
It's really just that simple.

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.000
So we're gonna wrap it up and then I'll see you in the next clip, where we're going to do a quick summary
