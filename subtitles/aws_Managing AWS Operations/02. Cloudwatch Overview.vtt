00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.840
[Autogenerated] in this Plett,

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.230
We're going to start discussing Cloudwatch at an overview level.

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.000
So we're gonna go through the overview from the consul itself.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.140
We're gonna look at dashboards which allow us to configure different widgets.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.700
We're gonna work with our alarms so we can monitor different metrics in

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.200
alarm our teams when these metric thresholds air crossed,

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.130
we're gonna work with events in rules which allow us to perform certain tasks

8
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.400
when certain cloudwatch events are triggered in our account.

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.640
And then we're gonna go and work with logs.

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.380
So actually logging to cloudwatch, which is its native functionality.

11
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.880
And then we're also going to talk about metrics,

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.900
which is gonna include metric filtering and subscriptions.

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.320
So let me go ahead and actually open up my AWS console screen.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.280
Now, once I'm here at the home page, I'm gonna find cloudwatch here,

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.670
which is under my recently visited services.

16
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.620
I'm gonna open that up, and that brings us to the landing page for cloudwatch.

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950
You can see here we have an overview and there are

18
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.180
several different options in this menu,

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.220
and we'll actually go and discuss these different options and how they

20
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.140
actually appear here here later on within this module.

21
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.320
Now I just scroll down on this landing page here.

22
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.620
We can see that we have alarms that are broken down by AWS service.

23
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.940
So I have to building alarms.

24
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.470
Right now,

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.640
we have an insufficient within our Lambda service and then

26
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.540
really no other ones that are configured.

27
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.350
But this really allows us to see at a high level quickly what type of

28
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.170
alarms that were experiencing within our AWS account.

29
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.960
Now, over here on the right, we can actually see our recent alarms.

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.790
We can see my building alarm because I'm having estimated charges

31
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.380
that cross a threshold and we'll dive into metrics and how they're

32
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.400
measured here later on in this module.

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.140
And then you can see I have an indication alarm for our Lambda functions.

34
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.080
And then if I scroll down a little bit more, we can see if we wanted to.

35
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.660
We can also enable across service dashboard.

36
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.030
So what this would allow us to do is, as it says,

37
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.190
aggregate key metrics from each other services in our account.

38
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.220
So I would click this if I want to enable it.

39
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.850
And there we go.

40
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.390
We can see I've cloudfront billing Total error rate,

41
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.750
which is underneath cloudfront.

42
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.860
We have our logs, all of the different services that are active in our account.

43
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.870
So I'm actually go up here.

44
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.100
I'm gonna go back to overview, and then I'm going to scroll all the way down,

45
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.300
and we can actually see that we can set a default dashboard.

46
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.540
So when we're creating a dashboard, which we'll talk about in the next clip,

47
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.900
we can name it cloudwatch default, and it will be displayed here.

48
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.930
So we're going to skip that for now and then the last thing I

49
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.250
want to show you here on this particular pages,

50
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.150
the time range.

51
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.260
If you see, we can actually specify certain presets for times,

52
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.540
or we can get in here in to find a custom time.

53
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.870
Now, we're not going to dig into this in this clip,

54
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.730
but this will come into use when we start to finding alarms

55
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.260
and metrics that we need to measure for.

56
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.640
So I'm gonna close out of this,

57
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.500
and then I just want to walk through the menu over here on the left.

58
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.670
We can see we have dashboards, which is what we'll talk about in the next clip.

59
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.980
Our alarms.

60
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.680
We have events, we have logs, and then we have metrics.

61
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.970
So these air really all of those topics that we

62
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.590
talked about back on the presentation.

63
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.210
So I'm gonna go and wrap this clip up.

64
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.900
So now we should have a firm understanding of

65
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.000
cloudwatch as a service from a high level. Now, I'll see you in the next clip where we're gonna discuss dashboards.
