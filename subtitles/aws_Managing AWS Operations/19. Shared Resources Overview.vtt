00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.040
[Autogenerated] Okay, Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.470
Now let's dive in to S S M documents,

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.250
which falls under the shared resource is section in Systems Manager.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.450
Now,

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.540
what I have here is an example or a snippet of an

6
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.340
example from a document within a W s.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.510
Now, don't worry.

8
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.090
If you don't understand what this is doing it in the upcoming

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.880
clip will actually dive into the console,

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.180
start playing around with these documents and then demo

11
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.320
ing how these automation is work.

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.140
It's important to understand how these documents work because

13
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.380
everything automation wise within systems manager essentially runs

14
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.860
from an SS M document that tells it what to do.

15
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.350
Now, this is from the AWS creates snapshot document that's provided to us.

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.060
And the first thing we see is we have our schema version and our description.

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.330
So we're creating an E.

18
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.600
B s volume snapshot and really quickly you'll

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.250
notice that this format is in Yamil.

20
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.790
It supports both Jason an animal.

21
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.240
But Yandle is easier to read and it's usually a

22
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.150
preferred format due to the readability.

23
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.460
The next thing we have is our assumed role.

24
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.140
So which I am role Do we want to assume for this task

25
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.480
in order to perform our actions.

26
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.540
So for this one, since we're creating an E.

27
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.460
B s volume snapshot,

28
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.560
we might want to go ahead and assume this role that has

29
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.620
capabilities for performing those snapshot AP I calls.

30
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.200
The next thing we have is we have our parameters so we

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.830
can set parameters like Volume I d.

32
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.640
Here.

33
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.420
And then we can reference those parameters later on in our steps so

34
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.250
that we can perform actions using their values.

35
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.370
So in this example, we're providing a volume I D.

36
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.010
And you can see it's required.

37
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.020
And then we have our description and that's optional.

38
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.640
And you can tell it's optional because obviously it says it.

39
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.520
But we provided a default for them so they don't have to fill it out.

40
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.320
Since there's no default in volume, I.

41
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.740
D.

42
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.950
This is a required input.

43
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.030
After we get our parameters all set up, we move on to our main steps.

44
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.610
So these are automation steps that were performing.

45
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.020
You can see we have our name,

46
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.170
which is create snapshot and then we have our a p I action.

47
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.120
You can see it's running.

48
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.960
Execute a W s a P I and with this action, we provide our inputs in our inputs.

49
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.480
Are our service so easy to what AP I are we calling Create

50
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.610
snapshot were referencing that volume I d parameter from

51
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.740
above as well as the description.

52
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.730
So now you can see how our steps tie in with our parameters for use.

53
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.400
And then when it's all said and done,

54
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.580
we have an output section so we can output certain values if we want.

55
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.980
And in this example,

56
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.980
their payload output is selecting the snapshot I devalue that

57
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.170
comes from the result of this snapshot, and it's out putting it to the console.

58
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.840
So now that we've broken down this automation document to give

59
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.940
you a general understanding of how they work,

60
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720
let's actually start looking at the documents in the

61
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.460
console will make some changes to a couple and then we'll

62
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.000
actually execute them as well. So when you're ready, go ahead and move on and will continue
