00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.480
Hi, everyone, in this that year, we're going to continue implementing the Flipkart functionality.

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.250
All right, so we are still in our statement blog.

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.190
The reason for that is the first click is easy to find out when it is first click its first car.

4
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.150
But when the second click happens, it means that it is the second car.

5
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.280
And then we need to do a bunch of logic to find out whether that card, which is the second card, is

6
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.810
equal to the first card.

7
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.240
If it is equal, then what should we do?

8
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.220
If it is not equal, then what should we do?

9
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.810
So that's why everything happens in the P&L statement.

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.910
All right.

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.760
So we have successfully mapped where the second card is now.

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.150
What do we want to do to find out whether those cards match and when they match?

13
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.530
Then what do we want to do?

14
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.250
Right.

15
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.790
So here is where we are going to implement another if statement because we want to find out if their

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.300
match.

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.710
We're going to do one thing.

18
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.800
If they're not a match, we are going to do another thing.

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.390
All right.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.550
So if and we have we have successfully found out.

21
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.070
Yeah, we have successfully found out the values for the data set, that name of those cards, which

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.640
are click.

23
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.730
So through that we can find out if they match.

24
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.520
So first card, the data set date name, which I have given it myself, if it matches the second card,

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.260
the data set.

26
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.600
Does name if they match, it means that the first card and the second card, they are the same.

27
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.060
All right.

28
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.910
And when they're are the same, it means that it is a match.

29
00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.620
M80, C.H., and what do we want to do, we want to disable the cars, it means we want to we want our

30
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.630
cars to stay where they are.

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.250
We do not want to move them.

32
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.030
We do not want our cars to flip.

33
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.979
So I'm just going to call them disable the cards.

34
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.250
So how can we disable those cards?

35
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.800
The cards, they have an event on them.

36
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.860
And this event is a click event.

37
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.170
So let's go ahead and let's remove that event.

38
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.480
So we are going to grab our first card that we have another method that is remove event listener, event

39
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.920
listener.

40
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.200
OK, so what is the event, the event is a click event and what is the function associated with that

41
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.480
event?

42
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.210
It is the Flipkart function, so we are going to remove it from the first cart as well as the second

43
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.680
cart.

44
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.270
So when there are a match, we want to remove this event listeners.

45
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.530
It means that we want to disable the cards.

46
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.320
What if it's not a match when it is not a match?

47
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.600
We are going to run in our statement.

48
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.760
If it is not a match, OK, and we want to grab our first car now, first off, let's talk about what

49
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.870
if it is not a match?

50
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.030
If it is not a match, we want to flip the cards again, OK?

51
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.550
It means we want to add the flip card class to our first car, to the second car.

52
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.260
If they're a match, we want them to stay there, to stay flipped or to be disabled.

53
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.950
If they are not a match, then we want to we want them to flip, OK?

54
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.340
So something like that, so I'm in here, I'm going to say not a match, then what do we want to do?

55
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.310
We want and flip cards.

56
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.210
All right.

57
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.970
So we are going to grab the first card and we are going to say class list, dot remove.

58
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.480
Remove the fluff class, and if you remember correctly, this is where we added the flipped class,

59
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.140
the flipped class basically says that the cars, they should rotate 180 degrees and receive a perspective.

60
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.839
And when they are not a match, we do not want them rotated.

61
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.470
We just want him to flip again.

62
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.000
OK, or to flip.

63
00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:27.860
And we are going to apply that for the second card as well, and then we are going to dive in and see

64
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.550
our results.

65
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.550
So let's come here.

66
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.430
So when I click on this one and I click on this one, because both of them are a match, they're going

67
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.080
to disable, they're going to stay.

68
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.170
Now, let's click on this cat and mouse click on this.

69
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.460
Both of them are the same.

70
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.830
So that's why they stay.

71
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.740
So let's click on this and let's click on this.

72
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.630
And whenever I click on it now, you guys can see there isn't a bug with this.

73
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.430
There is an issue.

74
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.830
The issue is that before seeing the second card, the first card and flips.

75
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.330
And why is that?

76
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.810
The reason for that is because this card, the second card that I just clicked, is not equal to the

77
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.470
first card.

78
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.410
That's why the both of them then flip.

79
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.270
See, this is a cat and this is a dog.

80
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.170
Now, we should be able to see this change.

81
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.220
OK, now, whenever they are a match, they are going to stay, of course, but when they're not a match,

82
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.310
we should be able to see that that they are not a match.

83
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.600
This happens so fast that we cannot see it.

84
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.860
Well, it happens like in no time before like like before showing the card.

85
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.170
The second card, this statement comes in and it removes the flipped class.

86
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.160
But we want to we want to have some time to see the second card and to know for ourselves that they

87
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.860
do not match and then they should flip.

88
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.390
But because they are they do not match, they flip immediately.

89
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.670
But we do not want to do that.

90
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.410
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut this and I'm going to create a set time out function.

91
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.450
Right.

92
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.340
And in sit time out function.

93
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.310
Let's go ahead and let's yeah.

94
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.330
Let's create a function.

95
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.010
But you know what?

96
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.790
This is not the optimum way of doing it.

97
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.490
So I'm going to create an arrow function for now.

98
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.460
Just keep this in mind that this is the syntax and I'm going to give it 1500 milliseconds.

99
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:30.720
It means that the time that we will have to look at the second card, even though it is not a match,

100
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.450
is going to be one point five seconds.

101
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.950
Then in here we are going to add a block of code.

102
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.010
So this block of code is going to be active for 1500 seconds.

103
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.820
So let's click on this and on this, we know both of them are a match.

104
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.460
What about this and this?

105
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.750
Exactly after one point five seconds, they are going to unfold.

106
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.710
We do not want them to unclip immediately.

107
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.740
We want them to to be shown to the user that they're not a match, then they should.

108
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.500
Honfleur, you can increase or decrease this time.

109
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.750
This is in milliseconds.

110
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.810
That's up to you.

111
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.020
But I think 1500 is is a good time.

112
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.550
So this is a cat and this is a hamster.

113
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.510
They do not match.

114
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.410
They flip.

115
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.640
If they match, they they get disabled or they stay.

116
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.990
All right, this is going to be it for this video.

117
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.550
See you guys in the next one.
