00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.170
Hi, everyone, in this chapter, we are going to create a custom animated progress bar.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.310
Oh, right.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.160
So this project is going to be a relatively shorter one than before.

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.650
Right.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.460
And we are going to make sure that we wrap up this project in just one video.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.750
So what do we have?

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.870
So we have a progress bar.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.300
It looks like a progress report that says 80 percent.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.650
If I go ahead and reload the page, you're going to see that it comes from the left nicely and right

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.790
and it goes all the way to 80 percent.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.110
And the reason that it is added because it says here 80, this data and the data done is 80.

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.410
So if I were to go ahead and to change it, for example, to 50 and reload it, you're going to see

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.140
even though the Texas Adebari, because the text is hardcoded, it is going to be it is going to be

14
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.430
all the way up to 50.

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.040
So this is what we are going to build here.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.460
The estimate is super simple.

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
We have a divide that has a class of progress and another divide that has a class of progress.

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.270
Dasch done and data done is almost 80 percent is exactly 80 percent.

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.210
Some basic reset in the success.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.120
And we have some flex starling in the body just to make it center.

21
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.940
We have some stalling for the progress, which is the apparent.

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.890
All right.

23
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.320
Which is the parent and some stalling for the progress on just a background image, linear gradient

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030
and some flux properties just to make this text in the center.

25
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:43.560
And and by default, you are going to set the width and the opacity to zero and we are going to dynamically

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.350
change the width and the opacity through JavaScript.

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.150
All right.

28
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.400
So we are going to go ahead and we are going to dive into the Aegeus.

29
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.320
I told you guys this is going to be a relatively shorter project.

30
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.480
So first we are going to grab the progress done.

31
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.990
And that's basically we are we just need the progress done.

32
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.729
So I'm going to document that query selector and we are going to grab the progress Dasch done class.

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.130
And in case you're wondering, it's this Inside side-Effect.

34
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.840
All right, so we are going to go ahead and we are going to say sit time out, which is a method, which

35
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.080
is a window method and in here.

36
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.060
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to head to and I'm going to hit enter, which it didn't work.

37
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.360
So function.

38
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.810
Let's click on this now.

39
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.090
Maybe the the below one.

40
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.370
I just want to grab everything.

41
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.660
Yes.

42
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.920
So this is the syntax for a set time out here.

43
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.750
We specify a time when we reload the page after this time is past, we are going to see the navigation

44
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.280
animate.

45
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.260
So let's go ahead and let's open it with life.

46
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.780
I think we have it right here.

47
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.200
Right.

48
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.020
So we wanted to go to B appeared after 500 milliseconds.

49
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.580
The reason that we do this with JavaScript is that we want to see this when half a second after half

50
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.840
a second has been passed.

51
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.770
So if I were to put it to two seconds and when I save it, we are going to see this effect right after

52
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.630
two seconds.

53
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.850
So this is basically the part that we are making in JavaScript are just we just want to make sure that

54
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.790
it appears after a certain amount of time has passed.

55
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.880
Now, this is the syntax for an arrow function.

56
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.620
But what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and remove that syntax and we are going to use

57
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.900
a regular function.

58
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.090
And in this function, we are going to say after 500 milliseconds this past Grob the progress.

59
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.290
Oops, I don't know why does that grab the width?

60
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.110
And in the progress, do not get the attribute.

61
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.720
What is the attribute.

62
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.900
Is the good attribute.

63
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.140
Hmm.

64
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.920
Get attribute.

65
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.410
Why.

66
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.410
What is the attribute that we want to get.

67
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.910
It is the data dasht done and when you get that attribute, add it to a string of pixel and the next

68
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:15.000
thing that I want to do is get the progress and then the tile and then the opacity and then make it

69
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.230
to equal to one.

70
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.420
So when I say it and when we come here, we are going to see that it is going to say 80 percent right

71
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.440
in here and it should go all the way to 80 percent.

72
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:37.670
All right, so let's come here, the height, the width is zero by default, and in here we grab the

73
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.340
data done and it should go all the way to 80 percent.

74
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.420
Oh, the reason that it doesn't go is because we added a pixel, this should be a percentage.

75
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.900
So now it goes all the way to 80 percent.

76
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.290
It is 80 percent.

77
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.600
And then at that point, we just had 80 pixels, which was right about here.

78
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.370
All right.

79
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.170
And when we go ahead and reload the page, we're going to see that it comes nicely from the left towards

80
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.650
the right.

81
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.420
And this is it for this project.

82
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.190
See you guys in the next one.
