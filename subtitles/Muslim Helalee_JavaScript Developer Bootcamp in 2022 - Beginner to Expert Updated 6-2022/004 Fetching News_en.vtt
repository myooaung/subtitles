00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.140
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.250
In this next year, we are going to fetch news.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.850
All right, so now that you are set up and all that formality is out of the way, what I want to do

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.490
is we are going to grab this input.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.290
And whenever this input is submitted or when they enter, a key is pressed.

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.300
We want to fetch the data.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.660
So first off, let's go ahead and let's create a constant that says news input.

8
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.940
All right, so we're going to say document, document that query selecter, let's grab the news input

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.360
so it has a class of news input.

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.870
Let's put it here, the next thing that I want to grab is going to be our form and I'm going to just

11
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.560
grab it by the element selector query selector, and I'm going to name four because I don't have any

12
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.610
other forms in here, so it should work.

13
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.230
And finally, we are going to grab our newest container.

14
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.440
So here is our newest container.

15
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.920
So let's grab this.

16
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.560
I'm not grabbing the titles because the titles, they are not doing anything.

17
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.580
They're just sitting there.

18
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.040
Say, concert news container.

19
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.280
Document to query, query, select tour, sparser right here.

20
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.500
All right, so let's grab the four.

21
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.890
And we are going to add a listener, the event is going to be submit and we are going to run a function

22
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.160
here.

23
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.130
First off, we want to remove we want to prevent the default behavior, the default default behavior

24
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.990
of the form submission is it is going to reload the page, right.

25
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.960
But we do not want to reload that page.

26
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.730
We just want to grab the data.

27
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.610
The next thing that I want to do here is I want to grab my search query.

28
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.670
So I'm going to say search query.

29
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.979
Where is the search query coming from?

30
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.790
It's coming from the value of the input.

31
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.510
So we have selected the input.

32
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.560
I'm going to say news input to add value.

33
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.920
Very simple.

34
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.230
That's going to be our search query.

35
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.260
And now we are going to say fetch news and we are going to pass in our search query.

36
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.710
Now, let's go ahead and let's create that function.

37
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.750
So async function.

38
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.580
The function is going to be fetch news.

39
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.100
Fake news, all right, and we are going to pass in the search query as the parameter.

40
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.700
All right.

41
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.720
Soon here.

42
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.630
What I want to do is I want to grab my API key and I want to provide it inside a separate, constant,

43
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.150
constant.

44
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.400
And I'm going to call it API key.

45
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.750
Right.

46
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.510
And my API key is I have actually generated two APIC so I could use either of them because I have two

47
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.960
accounts and that's why.

48
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.010
And now let's go ahead and let's ask for the response.

49
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.540
Let's make the response.

50
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.090
Our response is going to be we are going to wait until the fetch is completed and then we are going

51
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.060
to store it inside the response variable.

52
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.230
So what is the you are all that we are making requests.

53
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.810
We know that.

54
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.640
What are you Earl is right.

55
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.800
And I'm just going to copy it from here and I'm going to put it.

56
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.940
Yeah, I'm going to put it right here.

57
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.490
OK, let's put it right.

58
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.170
So this this is the world that we are making requests to.

59
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.650
It's actually this.

60
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.700
You are also if I were to copy it from here, all the way to questionmark, do not get the Q that because

61
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.010
I'm going to be explaining it.

62
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.790
So it's going to be the same.

63
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.230
And then we are going to write.

64
00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.700
Q An equal sign.

65
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.720
What is the Q The Q is whatever the user inputs in that, the value of the user's input.

66
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.410
So how can we grab that.

67
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.630
We have already selected that and that is.

68
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.980
Search.

69
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.970
Search query perfect, which is coming from here, and then we need to pass in our API, so you are

70
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.200
going to write and.

71
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.660
API, Dasch, KEYT, equal to you need to write this and then what is the API keyless Gravett API key?

72
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.640
Perfect.

73
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:46.090
Let's grab our response response data and we are going to sit await Jason.

74
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.340
In response to the U.S. response.

75
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.420
Jason.

76
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.210
And now let's consider Lagoa response, console the log.

77
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.440
Let's see what we have inside the response data.

78
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.070
And we have called the function here.

79
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.810
So whenever I click sorry, I submit the form, then this is going to run, right.

80
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.390
So let's save it.

81
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.270
Let's come here.

82
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.930
Let's open up the inspect.

83
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.250
I'm going to put it on the side.

84
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.650
It's easier there, right?

85
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.730
He's here now.

86
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.010
It's not.

87
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.360
But down the bottom, the bottom.

88
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.430
All right, so let's say succah.

89
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.980
Soccer.

90
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.660
Enter and we get the response now inside the response, you can see that we get all this weird mumbo

91
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.170
jumbo.

92
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.960
All right, but what it what it is that we are interested in is this results, which is empty.

93
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.760
All right.

94
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.770
And you can say the status is OK.

95
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.890
User tier is developer because that's what I used.

96
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.360
Order by relevance.

97
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.560
Current page one.

98
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.450
That's because I have misspelled this one.

99
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.590
So if I say soccer, I have misspelled it.

100
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.200
That's why there are no results.

101
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.030
So if I enter this, we should see some results.

102
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.880
Let's enter it one more time.

103
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.360
Let's come here.

104
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.050
And now we get how many?

105
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.760
We get ten results.

106
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.250
All right, and a total of fourteen hundred, a total results are fourteen hundred.

107
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.820
All right, so now that we have successfully made calls to the CPI, let's see what it is that we are

108
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.450
looking for.

109
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:47.790
So we are looking for our response data, which is generated, this DOT response, which is this one,

110
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.680
and from their results, which is this one.

111
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.230
And inside the results, you can see we have these these objects and these objects.

112
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.500
They contain our Aperol I.D. and we have our section names.

113
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.250
So this is what we are going to grab.

114
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.940
We have our Web publication date.

115
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.440
This is what we are going to grab.

116
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.790
And we have our web.

117
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.530
You are out and this is what we are going to grab.

118
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.580
All right.

119
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.120
All right.

120
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.520
So let's go ahead and let's convert this into a meaningful data.

121
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.620
Right.

122
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.270
So I'm going to remove this now.

123
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.260
I'm going to keep it here.

124
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.640
So if I say response.

125
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.940
Response to dot results.

126
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:41.250
Response the results and save it and do, for example, climate and save it now you can see we get ten,

127
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.780
so we get all of this.

128
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.370
So now this is an array of objects so we can loop over it.

129
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.140
All right.

130
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.100
So this is what we get.

131
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:57.210
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a function and as a as a argument, I'm going to

132
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.410
pass and this so I'm going to say news results.

133
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.350
News results is going to be this.

134
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.080
And this is the argument for this function.

135
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.200
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to create that function.

136
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.020
So I'm going to say function news results, results, let's put it.

137
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.200
And the parameter is going to be results itself.

138
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:26.280
So first off, I'm going to create a a variable and set it to an empty strength.

139
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:35.159
And then we are going to change the the inner HTML of this element.

140
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.169
So sorry, this.

141
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:45.060
Variable, what's happening to me, I don't know, so we are going to have news, the news, right?

142
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:53.310
And then so in here, if I were to say Consul Log results Consolo, I shouldn't even log, but I'm still

143
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.650
going to do it results.

144
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.630
We should see the results that are coming from here.

145
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.850
So if I constantly Google results, let's save it.

146
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.600
Let's come here.

147
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.450
So if I say climate, we get ten results, right.

148
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.370
And comes from loan to any six, which is right here.

149
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.290
So instead of this, I'm going to say results because it's an array.

150
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.150
I'm going to say for each.

151
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.930
For each and we are going to pass on our results.

152
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:28.280
Result singular and for each of the results, what do we want to do?

153
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:35.310
First off, let's grab the section name from that result, the Web publication name, a date, the Web

154
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.650
URL and Web title.

155
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.880
So let's store all of this information.

156
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.040
I'm going to say I just showed you that news section and it's going to be a result.

157
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.670
DOT section, section name.

158
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.330
So section, section name.

159
00:09:53.470 --> 00:10:02.290
We are going to let new state news date and it was result web publication date.

160
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:02.630
Right.

161
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:07.990
So Web publication, publication date.

162
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.170
And we have our news.

163
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.830
You are our news are always used whenever the the users click user clicks on it.

164
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.740
So it was web you URL Web.

165
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.930
You are well, so where you are.

166
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.630
And finally, we have.

167
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:42.400
Let new title, new title, and that's news, this is the ass, here is this new title.

168
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.670
What was what is the title?

169
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.520
The title is Result DOT Web title.

170
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.840
Web title.

171
00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:00.780
OK, so after that, now that we have selected these, now let's grab our fetched news, fetched news

172
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.820
and we are going to set it equal to an X.

173
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.320
So in here what it is that we want to create.

174
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.740
So we are going to create a diff.

175
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.900
So let's, let's create a diff.

176
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.060
The devil is going to have a class of news that if you remember in our stimulus's review, we didn't

177
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.900
have that because this that diff is created dynamically.

178
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.120
So this is the diff.

179
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:35.270
And inside here, we are going to have so the first two, that section and the the date they were paragraphs

180
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.310
and the third one was an anchor text.

181
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.060
So they're going to create a paragraph.

182
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.330
And this is our paragraph.

183
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.590
So this is going to be our section.

184
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.140
Right.

185
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.350
So I'm just going to pass a new section.

186
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.600
All right, and I'm going to copy this line and this paragraph is going to be our news date.

187
00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:01.500
All right, and finally, we have an anchor tag, so let's create that anchor to make.

188
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.660
Hmm, is it does it does income tax half closing tax?

189
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.890
I think so.

190
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.780
So, Trev, where is the strength when you click on it?

191
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.120
Where it goes, it goes to the news.

192
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.920
You are Al, right?

193
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.270
So.

194
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.000
Hmm hmm.

195
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.090
I should grab the news.

196
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.840
Right.

197
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.850
I should do that news.

198
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.380
You I don't know why I was thinking.

199
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.710
And now that's the Ashraf.

200
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.950
But what is the title for the anchor tag?

201
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.990
What is the content of the anchor to the content of the anchor tag is the news title.

202
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:47.900
All right, and now let's say that there are two issues with this, but I'm not going to fix him here.

203
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.780
I need to show it to you so I am able to fix it sensibly.

204
00:12:52.960 --> 00:13:01.750
So let's each time that's at it, let's say now we are going to grab our news container and we are going

205
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:09.700
to say that in HTML and we are going to set it to fatchett the news, say, well, let's come here.

206
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.130
Perfecto.

207
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.980
So climate save it entered.

208
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.620
There we go.

209
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:23.740
So we get undefined here we get this and we get climate crisis.

210
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.550
Does journalism actually make a difference?

211
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.640
Why did we get undefined for the section so suck.

212
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.520
Because we have misspelled it.

213
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:41.820
So let's try it again one more time, so I'm going to say, Bird, we get environment time and that

214
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.280
so this news is from this time.

215
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.600
All right, keep that in mind.

216
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.140
This course is not the news.

217
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.990
This from this time.

218
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.140
Right.

219
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:55.010
So why why do we only get one result, we're the other ones, so that's the first issue.

220
00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:01.220
It's because the second result is going to override the first one and then the third one is going to

221
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.360
override the second one because we don't have any plus vinyard.

222
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.600
Plus all of them are going to be added on to this news.

223
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:16.210
So now if I save it and if I say Birdie the bird, we get all these results.

224
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.940
See, we get all of them perfect.

225
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:29.450
So if I click on it and now this is another problem, I think it was my previous oops, that's not a

226
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.070
good page.

227
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.010
So let's.

228
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.170
Django Bates.

229
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.060
What is this weird stuff?

230
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:46.920
So I think it was my previous course that I talked about this issue, talked about this thing that whenever

231
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:53.850
you you provide you are inside your website, make sure that they do not take away the focus of your

232
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.300
website.

233
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.700
Now, this URL, it takes away the focus from this website because.

234
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:11.570
When I when the user collects, the user is redirect is the user loses access to your website and goes

235
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.680
to here and then searches this Web site.

236
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:20.330
You have to provide the users in a way that the user, when the click when the user clicks on it, they

237
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.290
open in Anuta.

238
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.970
So they never they never get distracted away.

239
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.520
From your website.

240
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:35.340
So for that, we have a very, very, very, very, very simple track and that is another attribute

241
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.570
and that is target.

242
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:47.440
Equal to and when you said it to blank, underscore blank and save it and come here so you can say like

243
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:53.010
climate enter and when you click on it, it is going to open in a new window.

244
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.550
It doesn't matter which one to click.

245
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.500
So now your window is open and the new windows open as well.

246
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.840
So user never loses attention from your window.

247
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.250
This is something that you need to keep in mind.

248
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.430
Okey dokey.

249
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.980
So with this, I think I think our work here is done.

250
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.320
I know it was a long video, but I wanted to do it.

251
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.640
I wanted to do it in one lecture.

252
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.660
So let's check out the console.

253
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.100
We don't have any errors.

254
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.750
So let's check for something else for like maybe a couple of things.

255
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.380
Finance.

256
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:42.060
Perfect, we get some finance, we get university, we get that a varsity sized swan, see, Swan,

257
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.400
see?

258
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.790
All right.

259
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.100
So if I say TV.

260
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:54.550
We get TV, if I say like, um, a real estate real estate market.

261
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.840
St..

262
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.870
You can see that we get our results, there are there is no error and everything is working perfectly

263
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.030
fine, right.

264
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.060
But there is this we get 10 news, I think each time we are getting only 10.

265
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.750
And so we don't need the scrollbar, actually.

266
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.460
So I'm going to go to this d'Hiv, which has a class of news, and I'm going to just decrease the padding

267
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.140
by maybe like one pixel.

268
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.790
So this goes away.

269
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.480
Right.

270
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.560
So.

271
00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.890
News, where are you?

272
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:31.900
So it has a whiff, it has a border, it has that it doesn't have it should have potty.

273
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.790
So our anchor tax or twos.

274
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.840
Let's check it out here and just going to check it out.

275
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.820
So this is our paragraph and we have some padding for the news.

276
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.150
All right.

277
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.130
So the padding is being fed from here.

278
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.780
All right.

279
00:17:52.670 --> 00:18:00.020
So I'm going to copy that padding to the titles and I'm going to copy it to the news itself.

280
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.200
And this belongs to the top and bottom padding.

281
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.920
So I'm just going to decrease it by one pixel and save it.

282
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.370
Oops, save it and come here.

283
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.710
And now it goes away.

284
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:16.160
But now there is this that these they do not match, so they should match.

285
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.680
That is the border.

286
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:25.010
And so that was the twelve hundred let's put it 12, 20.

287
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.670
Oh, it's a little bit more I think it was 12, 18, if I remember correctly.

288
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:40.140
Save it and let's put it, yeah, yeah, it's 12, it's 12, 18, so now we get one, two, three,

289
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.810
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten news.

290
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.700
Without that we are scrollbar.

291
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:51.630
And I could go ahead and come in this one out or I could leave it in case you to increase the number

292
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.860
of news that you want to get.

293
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.480
But I think that's it for this lecture.

294
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.240
See you guys in the next one.
