00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,660
Hi, everyone, in this chapter, we are going to implement smooth scrolling for any website.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,390
All right, so what is smooth scrolling?

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:11,860
All right.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,930
So I just want to mention that if you are a student of my flex box, great SATs and advanced developers,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:28,440
advanced animations developer of course, then in which I have created so far three projects, OK?

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:36,120
And in the future I may add on to those projects more and these effects we have in all I think.

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,490
Yes.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,550
And all three of them we do have enough.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,880
But except for the second one and the first and third one, we do have enough.

10
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,210
But when you click on it, it's not going anywhere.

11
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:46,710
Right.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,340
So actually, a student, a student of mine asked for this.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,580
That's why I included it in the JavaScript project, because I just wanted to show you that this is

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,250
done actually through JavaScript.

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,660
You can't do it through access, but it's not that well supported across browsers.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
And that is this scroll not behavior.

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,250
It's not really supported.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,990
So you shouldn't do it now.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,600
It may be well supported, maybe like five or maybe like two years or three years.

20
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,210
But for now we can just implement it through a very lightweight JavaScript.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,700
You could say library, OK, because this is extremely difficult implementing through JavaScript.

22
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,510
That's why we are going to insert a small library of JavaScript.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,150
That is the smooth, smooth scroll.

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,570
Right.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,660
And this work works in this way, that, for example, you have four sections in your website.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,350
This is Section one, Section two, Section three, Section four, and when you have four sections,

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,620
whenever you want to click the about section, it should go to that section in a smooth manner.

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,710
OK, if you want it to go abruptly, you can do that through access, but we want it to go smoothly

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,050
there.

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,610
So this is how this what we are going to create here.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,169
So if we go to the contact section, click on the home, we are going to go to the home section.

32
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,060
These images, these text, this is this is actually nothing in here.

33
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,390
And I just wanted to go ahead and implement this.

34
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:23,590
In fact, these these sections, these images, they just simulate a real world kind of situation.

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:31,600
So if I click on the about contact, we can go to home, we can go to services, then contact then about

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,170
so we can move along this.

37
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,950
So the first thing that I'm going to do as well.

38
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,140
Well, actually, the JavaScript part is really, really simple.

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,130
It's just one constant that we are going to one variable that we are going to create, and that's it.

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,430
So if you go ahead to this, open this we are going to you're going to see a script where I have inserted

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,300
this, the CDN external JS file.

42
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,570
It comes from the JS to deliver a dot net.

43
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:10,460
And this is, I think, the person, Ferdinand Ferdinand, smooth scroll, this is the 15th version

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,280
and this is the script for that.

45
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,340
Just go ahead and insert it at the end of your e-mail document at the end of your body, of course not

46
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:19,840
e-mail.

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,170
And this is the JavaScript script because this is only one variable.

48
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,760
I did not create another ambiguous file like two to put it there because the lines of code are basically

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,450
like two and we don't need that for two.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,820
Right.

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,480
So this is the markup.

52
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:43,040
You are going to go over the markup and styling first and in the next lecture we are going to implement

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,220
it.

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:52,120
So first off, we have a diff container, so if I were to go ahead, where is the untack for that if

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,560
we don't have it?

56
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,270
So let's create it.

57
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,470
So now let's save it now.

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,940
We do have an intact for that for the stove.

59
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,270
So we have a diff which has a class of container inside that.

60
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,500
We have two sections.

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,790
One is not for the other, one is well actually our sections.

62
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,610
So we have four sections for now.

63
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,120
You can add or decrease or increase the number of sections in the Navar.

64
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:25,960
We have our nav ul and regular Elize, but the aircraft has Gosta to the IED of that section.

65
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,310
Now this is the important part.

66
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,970
Now this hash is inserted here because this section has an IED and the idea of that section is home.

67
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,350
That's why it goes there.

68
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,040
Right.

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,220
And the same is repeated for the rest of the sections.

70
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,980
And each section has the same idea.

71
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,460
And the idea of the section is inserted in the extra for this agritech.

72
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,970
And yes, I think that's it for the e-mail and the CSIS.

73
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,030
First we have a reset, then we have some stats for the body.

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,040
Regular style's very simple.

75
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,710
Then we have our container.

76
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,550
This is the big diff.

77
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,830
That is the container of them all.

78
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,730
Highton With we have the Navar position is fixed because when we scroll up and down we don't want it

79
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:17,320
to scroll, we want it to be fixed in relation to the scroll display we have.

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,880
OK, this one is incorrect actually.

81
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,450
So let me take it out and OK, this is actually the project that we are working on.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the complete project.

83
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,970
You see, it works.

84
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,070
But this one, it doesn't work.

85
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,390
It actually works.

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,230
But when you want that smooth behavior, you have to insert some sort of like JavaScript code or library.

87
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:47,230
So without with only access and this is an HDMI out, this is the part why it works because the aircraft

88
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,320
has the same idea of that section.

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,540
So if I click on the about it should go to the about section and it does go to the about section.

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,070
But the transition is so abrupt, it's not smooth.

91
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,180
And we are going to smoothen it in JavaScript through JavaScript.

92
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,870
We have some number you Elsom properties for that simple flex ally.

93
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,900
We have an I for the anchor tax and properties.

94
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,170
If there is any unique property, I'm going to explain it to you.

95
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:25,120
As I did explain the object Fed property, these display flags, and these are all flex properties and

96
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,430
they cannot be explained in just two minutes.

97
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:35,780
Because complete courses should be dedicated to item two topics or discussions of flux and grit, these

98
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,620
are the rest of them.

99
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,840
They are very, very basic properties that we have for home background image for home, and we have

100
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,740
some linear gradient on top of it.

101
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,390
So what I'm going to do in here, basically, I just want to change something.

102
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,790
So I want to grab all the three five.

103
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,680
This is the Alpha Channel and I want to change it to point well, actually, point five five.

104
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,670
So this text has a better contrast.

105
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,770
Oh, right.

106
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,570
So I guess we could go over the JavaScript as well.

107
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,800
So in the JavaScript, what we are going to do is we are going to create a constant and this code actually

108
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,290
comes from this GitHub.

109
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,340
So I'm just going to take a second and I'm going to show you the GitHub page for this.

110
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,560
So I've just I've just opened up the GitHub page.

111
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to put it, I don't know, like right here for your reference.

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,270
So this is actually to get help page for Smooth Scroll.

113
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,920
And the only thing that we had to do was just insert the CDN and then we are going to add this inside

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,370
the script that we have and we are going to go over what that is.

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,740
So I'm going to add it.

116
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm going to change the VAD to const.

117
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,960
All right, and we are going to create a new smooth scroll here and the smooth scroll is going to be

118
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,820
added to the Navar.

119
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,340
So for that one, I'm going to do it.

120
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,980
So let's go ahead and Colombus these sections to make the navigation better.

121
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:15,030
So I'm just going to add a number here because we are going to grab it and it is going to grab any Ashraf.

122
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,720
This is the asterisk selector.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,740
This is the asterisk attribute selector.

124
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:35,440
And we do have an and a hush hush here, so this address is going to select this attribute selector

125
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,950
is going to select any aircraft that has the character of hash in its name.

126
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,110
And that's that's basically it.

127
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,410
And it is going to it is going to select that.

128
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,610
And let's go ahead and let's save it.

129
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,540
So now I think we should be good.

130
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,780
So if I come here and if I click on the about now, you guys can see that this this is smooth, the

131
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,960
behavior is smooth, and that's it.

132
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,710
We just added the behavior.

133
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,050
We can go ahead and modify this.

134
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,690
We can add another function.

135
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,860
Well, not a function actually.

136
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,460
What we can do is we can modify this and we can.

137
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,940
I'd like a speed to it.

138
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,340
What is the speed that we want this to happen?

139
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,060
So we are going to add an object in here and we are going to give it 800 milliseconds.

140
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,420
So now if I click on it, it is going to take 800 milliseconds.

141
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,640
So if I put in like 3000 milliseconds, so let's click on it.

142
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,430
So let's click on this.

143
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,560
It is going to get it is going to take three seconds, three seconds to go from top to bottom.

144
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:51,640
All right, so it is very, very slow, you could put it to, I don't know, like 700 if you want faster.

145
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,460
So this is faster, but if you want it to be a bit slower, you can go with 800.

146
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,190
So what did we do wrong?

147
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,830
Let's save it and let's click here and it works.

148
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,830
So this is going to be it for this chapter and this project.

149
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:18,270
We basically inserted the CD in and we added the constant and voila, the project works.

150
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,480
And this is how simple it is whenever you're using JavaScript libraries.

151
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,360
But with vanilla JavaScript, this is like very, very difficult.

152
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,230
You know, you have this as a reference.

153
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,530
Well, because this but this does not belong to me.

154
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
This is someone else's library.

155
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,730
So smooth scrolls.

156
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,460
And I've just used it in this project.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,270
Right.

158
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,260
So that's it.

159
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,300
See you guys in the next lecture.
