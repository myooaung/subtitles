00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,660
Hi, everyone, in this we're going to implement that mouse move effect.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:17,140
All right, so this is where we left off in our previous lecture, and we have all these like almost

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,740
500 of them on the screen, and you can see that they bounce off the edges of the screen and whenever

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,440
we reload the page, they do not get recreated outside the canvas.

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,740
So what the only thing remaining here is implementing that mouse move effect that we have, you know,

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,030
that we have right here before implementing that, I'm just going to resize them to their original,

7
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,460
which was five.

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,330
So this is what their original was.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:46,960
Right.

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,020
So what we are going to do here first is I'm going to create an event listener, so I'm going to come

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,680
on top of that and I'm going to say mouse move, event listener.

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,480
Well, Senator.

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:10,690
Right, and we are going to add this event on the window, because whenever the mouse is moving in that

14
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,550
entire window, that event is going to be fired.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,100
So we are going to say that at a listener, it's going to be mouse move, no coykendall required, no

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,770
nothing, just mouse move.

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,430
And we are going to execute this function.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,840
First off, let me go ahead and cancel the event.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,070
Right.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,930
And let's say, well, let's come here.

21
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,540
I'm going to put it to side this console.

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,430
So now I'm just going to clear the console.

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,050
And whenever I hover on any of these balls, I haven't seen any of them.

24
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,470
You can see that when I hover on this entire page, it's not like I'm hovering on a specific ball.

25
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,620
No, it's like I'm hovering on this entire page.

26
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,950
Right.

27
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,080
You can see that this event is being fired.

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,520
And if I open up one of these here, we have an X and Y, right.

29
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,630
So if I were to clear this and if I come right here, so in here, we should have a small number for

30
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,260
X, I mean, right there.

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,640
And I'm just going to go out of it.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,910
So you should have a small number for X and we have to have a small number for Y.

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,360
There we go.

34
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,080
So five pixels along the x axis and two pixels along the Y axis.

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,300
So basically this is going to give us this X and Y.

36
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:38,650
These values are going to give us the exact coordinates of where that mouse is being is actually moving.

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:38,980
Right.

38
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,050
And we can use that to our advantage.

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,840
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a mouse effect.

40
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,560
Right, but actually, before creating this here, I need to create an object, so I'm going to say

41
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,360
let a mouse effect.

42
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,940
So this is going to be an object.

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,950
What does this object has?

44
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,740
Now, let's think about it first before actually implementing it.

45
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:19,380
So whenever any ball comes in, in in a close proximity to this pointer that the size of the ball is

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,730
going to get increased.

47
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,150
Right.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,320
And what is actually happening here whenever any balls, because they're moving with different velocities

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:36,130
in in different directions, whenever anybody comes in contact to like approximately 20 pixels, the

50
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,480
size is going to enlarge.

51
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:45,660
Right, that's what we are going to do in this and particularly in this lecture, so whenever the ball

52
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,970
comes in and like comes close to this pointer, so how can the ball come?

53
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,290
The ball has only two dimensions, sorry, two directions that it can travel.

54
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,760
So one is going to be the X and the other one is going to be the Y.

55
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:06,090
So what I'm going to do is within this mouse effect object, we need to trace for the X.

56
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,380
And for the why so initially I'm just going to set him to undefined.

57
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,339
Because we don't know where actually the mouse is, that's why I'm just going to set it to undefined

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,990
initially, we are not we don't know where it is.

59
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,550
And how do we know where it is we are going to know where it is when we move our mass, right?

60
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,540
So in here, I'm just going to say mass effect.

61
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,700
So I'm going to select the X property from that object and I'm going to send it to IDOT X and I'm going

62
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,130
to do the same thing for Y.

63
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:50,040
So let's put it to I, right, and now if I go ahead and if I log to the console, the mouse effect,

64
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,300
let's see what we get.

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
So if I come here, let's change it.

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,090
And if I hover on it, you can see that we get the X and Y.

67
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:07,290
OK, so it says that, for example, right here, the Y 726, the X is five twenty for the X goes all

68
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,610
the way to nine thirty eight.

69
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,180
Y is seven 10.

70
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,110
So this is going to give us the, the dimensions.

71
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,170
But keep this in mind that if you crack open any of these objects and if you come, you can see that

72
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,090
this is actually an object.

73
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,250
And which object is that?

74
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,060
I can see all of these prototypes inside the protoje of this object, but this object has it has two

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,340
properties, which is which are right here.

76
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,860
So basically we have modified the value for the X and the value for the Y.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,930
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a maximum radius.

78
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,500
So I'm going to say maxcy radius and I'm going to set it to 40.

79
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm going to set it to 50.

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,100
So this is the maximum size that the circles can get.

81
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,270
And let's sit in a mini radius.

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,950
This is the minimum radius that the circles can get.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,310
So Maxey radius, mini radius.

84
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,650
I'm going to set it to five.

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Right.

86
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,930
And after this, now, we need to implement the logic that and whenever any of the balls come close

87
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:24,180
to the pointer in the distance of 20 pixels, we want to enlarge those balls.

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,670
So when we see that we have a function of date balls here, now we have inside our constructor, we

89
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,810
have two methods.

90
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,390
The first one is actually drawing, but the second one is responsible for moving them.

91
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,140
Right.

92
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,810
So this is the function that is responsible for moving.

93
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:49,450
So inside here before this, I'm just going to come down here and I'm going to say mouse move effect.

94
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,040
All right.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,550
And.

96
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:00,610
And here I'm going to say, if I give this F Mass Effect dot X, we know what that value is.

97
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:09,530
That is the value of the pointer along the extraction minus this dot, the X position of the F, the

98
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:19,820
horizontal position of the pointer when we subtract it by the horizontal position of the ball if it

99
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,650
is less than 20.

100
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:33,520
And now this is going to be like chaining logical operators and and if the mouse effect acts or the

101
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,100
horizontal position of the cursor minus.

102
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,330
The horizontal position of the ball.

103
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:51,190
Is greater than negative to any pixels, it means that it's less than 20 pixels all the way to greater

104
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,830
than 20 pixels in that in that range.

105
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,220
Right.

106
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,880
So this is for the horizontal direction, whether we want to do for the vertical, basically, we are

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,010
going to do the same thing.

108
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,760
So I'm just going to go ahead and copy this and I'm going to put it right here.

109
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,850
But there is one thing missing, and that is a logical operator right here.

110
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:20,650
So we are going to f also the Y position of the cursor minus the Y position of the circle is less than

111
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,540
20 pixels.

112
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,340
So they are close to each other and along the right side of the window.

113
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,110
Sorry when this is why.

114
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,140
So this is going to the positive is going to be towards the bottom and if it is X the positive is going

115
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:46,080
to be towards the right and also the Y position, whenever it is less than minus 20 pixels.

116
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,800
What do we want to do in this?

117
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,550
So we know that we have successfully traced that.

118
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm just going to save it.

119
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,300
So the code for formatter, take care of take takes care of it.

120
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,370
And why do we want to do we want to apply that an if statement in here.

121
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,990
Because if this dot radius.

122
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,770
Now what, what is the radius.

123
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,060
The radius is 30.

124
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:16,570
If 30 is less than the maximum radius, the max radius, it means that we want to enlarge that circle.

125
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,240
It means the circle is small and we want to enlarge it.

126
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,070
And I'm going to say this dot radius and I'm going to enlarge it.

127
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,140
I'm going to add on one to it.

128
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:26,710
Right.

129
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,120
If elusive.

130
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:39,350
Also, the radius of the circle, which is 30, is greater than the mini radius.

131
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,700
What do we want to do?

132
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,220
We want to subtract from the radius.

133
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,370
So basically, we want to keep it between the radius, the radius of the circle.

134
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,470
We want to keep it between the mini and the max.

135
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,660
So this is the radius.

136
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,840
We are going to subtract one from it each time.

137
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,400
Let's save it.

138
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,420
Let's come here.

139
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,440
So this is what we have so far in here.

140
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,710
Let me refresh the page.

141
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,420
So when I hover on the circle, you can see that the circles, they get bigger, but they still they

142
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,590
stay big.

143
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,700
Right.

144
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,330
And.

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,770
OK, so let's hover on that, they do not get back to the normal size, they should get back to their

146
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,540
normal size.

147
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:36,900
So we had if the mass effect minus this Star XP is Lessner and the also greater than negative 20 pixels,

148
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,290
less than 20 and greater than 20 pixels.

149
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,180
What do we want to do?

150
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,560
We want to grab the radius of the radius is less than the max radius.

151
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,600
We are going to add to the radius.

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,060
Ancef, the radius as.

153
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,020
Hmm.

154
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,450
All right.

155
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,830
OK, I think the reason that it is not working is because this ownself is in the incorrect position,

156
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:16,860
because the NSF is going to be a part of this in this bigger if clause, because we have if all these

157
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,610
conditions are true, we want to add on to the radius.

158
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,770
If even one of these conditions is not true, we want to reduce the size.

159
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:34,830
So the size should not be provided within that, because if the circle is not is not close to the pointer,

160
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,090
we want to decrease its size.

161
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,530
That's why whenever I hover on them, they get increased.

162
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
For example, this blue circle, but we're in a hover away.

163
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,820
It doesn't get smaller.

164
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,720
Right.

165
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,910
So let's save this.

166
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,590
Let's come here now and see all of them.

167
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,090
They get smaller, they get bigger, and when they move away by tiny pixels, they're going to get smaller.

168
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,160
So we end up with this.

169
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,510
Now, this effect is going to be better if I just go going to go ahead.

170
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,770
And at 1000 now, I can see that we are going to get more balls in here.

171
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,240
What if I do like 4000 and.

172
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:18,990
So it's you can see that this is slow for me, so I'm going to change it back to 2000, for example,

173
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,270
let's see, it looks fine.

174
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,480
This is smooth and we get this kind of effect.

175
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,480
So whenever you hover on the circles and when the circles are in that close proximity of 20 pixels,

176
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
you're going to get big.

177
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,500
And when they go away by 20 pixels.

178
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,070
Farther than that, then they are going to get smaller automatically so we don't even have to move the

179
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,510
cursor to see the effect.

180
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,290
See, there we go.

181
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,640
So this is going to be it, I'm just going to set it to 1000, I think that's better.

182
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,460
That's it for this project and for this chapter.

183
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,370
And before wrapping this up, I want to say something that.

184
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,360
Starting our next game, starting our next actual game.

185
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,650
All right, these were actually some things that I needed to do in order to, like, solidify this,

186
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,750
the foundation of game development.

187
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:22,600
And starting from our next chapter where we started, our first game is going to be Pong Ping Pong,

188
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,930
and we are going to play against an A.I..

189
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,940
All right.

190
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,430
And it's going to be a very simple eye.

191
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,840
It's not going to be like crazy mathematics.

192
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,580
No, not something like that.

193
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,030
That's not something that I want to do in this course, because for that, we need to dedicate a complete

194
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:47,110
course, not just to do it as a part of another course, like complete A.I. development training and

195
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,590
all that.

196
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
That's basically another course.

197
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:56,080
But what I want to do is I just want to create that game and I want to implement it by like I want to

198
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,830
go against an AI and we are going to implement an intelligence level for that, because if if we play

199
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,920
against the AI, the AI is never going to lose.

200
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,290
I mean, that's just like a fact.

201
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,180
You can't win and we can just only win that game.

202
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,570
I've created that.

203
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,000
So I'm just giving you like a mental idea of what the game is going to be like.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,430
And if we play the game against the AI when it is in its full power, we will never be able to beat

205
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,630
it.

206
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,380
I mean, the pong, we will never even be able to score one.

207
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,100
And the reason that I'm saying all this is because starting from our Pong game until the end of this

208
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,620
course, until our last project, I haven't created that yet.

209
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,390
I don't know what that's going to be.

210
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,000
I have an idea and I'm not going to give away the spoilers or the surprise.

211
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,310
I'm not going to give you that.

212
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,110
I'm just going to work on that.

213
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:03,910
And I expect you to to be to follow what I'm saying, because we have done a lot of projects.

214
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,770
This was our project for three.

215
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,110
We have completed 61 chapters.

216
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:14,140
Aside from the course introduction, we have completed 60 chapters where we have talked about a lot

217
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,240
of beginner intermediate and a ton of advanced stuff.

218
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,780
And we have covered literally everything you will ever need when it comes to JavaScript.

219
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,620
The theory for that, the practicality of that, and if there is anything that you're not feeling comfortable

220
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,900
with, the course is at your disposal.

221
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:42,130
Go back to whichever chapter or whichever lesson it is that you think that you have not gotten gotten

222
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,090
the full grasp on the topics, that sort of thing.

223
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:53,650
Because when we get to our next game, next chapter, when we start actual game development, there

224
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,920
is going to be a lot of ideas that are going to be interconnected.

225
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,840
And I'm not going to be explaining, like, how a for loop works or how a form of work works or how,

226
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,200
if else statements they work, how functions work.

227
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,860
Now, we have covered all of that and I do not want to go over that anymore because there are a lot

228
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,470
of new stuff that we need to cover.

229
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,220
And as far as the collision detection is concerned, like bouncing off the changing the direction and

230
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,800
changing the velocity, these are the very, very beginner stuff that we have done like in the past

231
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,790
for projects, including this one has three projects.

232
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,210
And this one and I'm not going to be going over like in depth.

233
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,390
Of course, I will be explaining that, but not in that depth.

234
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,940
And I expect you to follow.

235
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:52,180
And and I just want to say that what I'm trying to say is when I created these games, I've created

236
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,780
two of them.

237
00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:00,640
So the next one is going to be the Kinect for a game, which is which has like a ton of game game development

238
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,270
logic, which is really fun when I created these two games and they're going to be like a couple of

239
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:13,510
a couple more, I assumed that your level is advanced to experts.

240
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,020
You know, I've not assumed that your level is beginner.

241
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,810
Your JavaScript knowledge level is beginner.

242
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,599
I have not even assumed that your JavaScript level knowledge is even intermediate.

243
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,890
I have assumed that it is advanced transitioning to expert.

244
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:37,900
So that's how would that mental mindset is how I created those games, those games and how I'm intending

245
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,060
to create the upcoming games right after that, as many as there might be.

246
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:43,960
All right.

247
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,560
So I just wanted to say that and I do not want to scare me away.

248
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:55,090
I just want to show you what the true power of JavaScript is in code, what is the power of code and

249
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,750
what you can really build with code.

250
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:06,020
Right, and again, if there is anything that you think that there are like uncertainties, just go

251
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,970
back to it just just just like brush over that knowledge.

252
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,040
And after that, come with me to the next lecture.

253
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,880
Well, we will create our very interesting game, which is the Pung.

254
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,680
So see you guys then.
