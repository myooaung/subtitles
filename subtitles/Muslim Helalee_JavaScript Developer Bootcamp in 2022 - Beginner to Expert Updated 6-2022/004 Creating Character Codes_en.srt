1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,060
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to create our character codes.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,650
All right, so before diving into this lecture, I want to show you the character codes that we will

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,400
be using inside this application.

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,400
So this is the part where this application could go a thousand different ways.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:29,660
We could go ahead and create different arrays with these letters and symbols that we have.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:37,820
But we could also use the character codes, the SCIRI character codes table and cheat sheet, which

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,170
is available at this YORO, which is at your disposal right here.

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,770
Right.

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,330
So here we are for each letter.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,870
We have a different code and we could use that code to access that letter, OK, to generate to include

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,030
it inside our password, generate function.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,730
All right, so, for example, the upper case letters, they start from 65 all the way and go all the

13
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,500
way to 90.

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,710
The lower case, they start from ninety seven, all the way to 122.

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,260
We have our symbols.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,280
We have our numbers.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
And then we again, we have our symbols.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,290
All right.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,260
So now taking this resource into consideration, we are going to create our character codes.

20
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,540
All right.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,670
So first off, before creating them, I'm just going to create a function inside of which we are going

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,470
to insert an array that is going to loop over these characters character codes, and each time is going

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,500
to grab one value from there.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,820
So I'm going to call this function.

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,530
Oops.

26
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm going to say character codes, looping function.

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,210
It's not a good name, but it definitely conveys the point.

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,700
All right, so let's create a function.

29
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,890
Let's call it Ray, low to high.

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,410
I don't know, something like that.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,430
OK, and we are going to insert two parameters of luks, not low and high.

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,960
All right.

33
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,480
So we are to loop.

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,460
So we are going to use a for a loop the loop variable.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,410
This time is going to be high and it is going to start from the low and it is going to go all the way

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,720
equal to less and less than or equal to high high.

37
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,250
And each time we are going to we are going to increment I by one.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,010
And what does it what is it going to do?

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,150
It is going to grab an array and it is going to push everything that it has created that push.

40
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,260
Right.

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,960
And what is it going to push to that array?

42
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,060
It is going to push our low variable.

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,370
OK, I'm going to explain this one more time.

44
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,580
But first off, let's create our array.

45
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,540
So I'm just going to call it a flat array for this stuff.

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,620
I'm just going to set it to an empty array.

47
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:08,600
And after that, when the loop variable runs our character codes and it grabs each time one of those

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,080
characters, it is going to pass it inside this empty array.

49
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,190
And then we are going to grab this material and we are going to call a string method of joint to convert

50
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,410
it to a string so we can display it or a user like this whenever we click.

51
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,180
This is an array which is converted into a string and we can display to a user.

52
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,010
All right, so at the end, what we want is we want to return or that said, this is it.

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,730
So this is this is what's going to loop over our character.

54
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,510
All right.

55
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,250
So let me remove that space maybe like provided now let's go ahead and let's create our character counts.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,300
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create the lowercase character codes.

57
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,730
Right.

58
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:00,500
So I'm going to tell you why not now maybe like in two more in the next two lectures.

59
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,910
So first off, I'm going to call it lower case.

60
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:14,780
Character Charcot's lower case character codes, and we are going to call our Arae our function of a

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,600
real low to high and it is going to iterate from one number all the way to another number.

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,710
So what is the lowercase character code?

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,590
So we are going to come in to our website, not my website, of course, and it is going to start from

64
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,060
97 and go all the way to 122.

65
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,090
So we are going to say.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,100
Start from ninety, go all the way to 122.

67
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:46,860
So now this has been created, the function knows what are the values, what are the numbers that it

68
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,020
is supposed to start looping?

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,190
From and what is the number that it is supposed to loop until that number, so the starting point is

70
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,440
97, the ending point is 122.

71
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,360
We have called this function once.

72
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,880
We are going to call it like a few times.

73
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,560
So the next variable that I want to and before creating that, whenever dysfunction loops over these

74
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,790
numbers, it is going to grab a number and we want to store that number inside this variable.

75
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,030
That's why we have called this function inside this variable.

76
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,890
We want to store that value here so we can access this value later on.

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,280
OK.

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,480
So the next one is I'm just going to call it no character codes, no Charcot's or character codes,

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,070
you are going to call our function and we are going to pass.

80
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,470
And so what are the number of character codes?

81
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,940
Let's come in to our website.

82
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,690
It says they start from 48 and they go all the way to 57.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,900
All right.

84
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,270
So we are going to say 48, 57, starting and ending point.

85
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,200
The next thing that I want to create is going to be our symbols, symbol, character, codes.

86
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,190
Let's go singular, not plural symbol character cotes.

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,970
OK, and we are going to call in our function of our low to high.

88
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,130
A real low to high.

89
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,450
Now let's see where our symbols this is going to be a bit trickier than the previous two.

90
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,570
So let's see.

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,020
So first off, our symbols, they're going to start from right here from 33 and they are going to go

92
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,640
all the way to 47.

93
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,300
So now, first off, let's pass those in 33 all the way to 47.

94
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:49,290
And then if we go ahead and take a look at that, we see that from 58 all the way to 64.

95
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,360
We again have we have our symbols.

96
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,450
And then from 91, all the way to 126, we again, we have our symbols.

97
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,380
So we need to add on to this array and the method that we are going to use for this kind of thing.

98
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,030
Whenever we want to add on to an array we are going to use.

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:19,160
A concat method, it says that additional items to add to the end of Array one combines two or more

100
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,120
arrays, right?

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,090
So it combines two or more right in here.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,290
So what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to include from 58 all the way to 64.

103
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,850
So this is going to be 58 all the way to 64.

104
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,480
And then we are going to call the concat once more.

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,720
And this time it is going to start from 91.

106
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:55,720
All right, so we have included it is going to start from 91 and go all the way to 96.

107
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,290
All right.

108
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,380
Because this is not 97, this is 123.

109
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,060
So it is going to start from 91 all the way to 96.

110
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:14,800
And finally concat, we are going to add more items to the end of this array from 123 up to 126.

111
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,500
All right, Sawan, 23, up to 126.

112
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,150
Let's save it.

113
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,560
So this is going to be the symbol character codes.

114
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:33,940
Each time that this function loops over these numbers, it is going to give us one specific or a specific

115
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,960
range of numbers, codes, and we are going to convert those close into actual characters and we are

116
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,470
going to store them inside the symbol character codes.

117
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,320
All right.

118
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,190
So lower case number and symbol there, Don.

119
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,810
The only thing remaining is our upper case.

120
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,230
So I'm going to call it upper case character code.

121
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,540
Right.

122
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,580
So it is uppercase character code.

123
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,580
And we are going to call in our function and let's pass on the two values.

124
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:11,800
So from here for the upper case, you can see that it starts from 65 and goes all the way to 90 because

125
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,370
it says upper case right here.

126
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,180
So 65, 90, 65, all the way to nine.

127
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,090
Oh, let's save it.

128
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,300
So now we have successfully created our character codes right here.

129
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,050
And what we're going to do in the next lecture is to create our very final function.

130
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,600
And that is, of course, the generate password function for which we have already created the function

131
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,860
of call, but the function itself is still missing.

132
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,110
So in the next lecture, we are going to create that function.

133
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,240
See you guys that.
