00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,750
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,770
In this lecture, we are going to update the chart based on the updated UI function.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,510
All right, so we are going to call the update chart function inside this update UI function, but there

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:24,700
is something that we need to consider that whenever we we are traveling from one file to another file.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,360
First off, you need to make sure that the file arrangement is accurate, that we want our charges to

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,610
run first and then the object file.

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,190
So this is the first thing.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,690
The second thing is we need to pass in the correct parameters, the correct parameters.

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,700
So we are going to pass an income, an outcome because we do have income, an outcome inside our update

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,110
UI.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,800
So first we are going to grab our context to D and we are going to clear our rectangle or our you know,

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,560
it's funny because it's a circle, but if you want to clear the canvas, you should call the clear rectangle

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:13,580
method zero for the X coordinate, zero for the Y coordinate and we are going to grab the canvas dot

14
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,320
with and we are going to grab the canvas dot.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,870
Height, right, and then now let's go ahead and let's define the ratio now, the ratio might seem a

16
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,730
bit weird, but I'm going to explain it.

17
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:37,140
So the ratio is going to be income divided by income plus plus outcome.

18
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,730
So I'm going to tell you why.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,260
So imagine the income is, too, and the outcome is one.

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,280
OK, so we are going to have to divided by two plus one.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,760
OK, so two divided by two.

22
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,740
OK, let's grab our calculator.

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,290
I know it's point seventy five but still so too divided by two plus one which is three.

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:12,320
So we get, we get two point six six not point seventy five point six says we get one third, we don't

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,460
get one fourth of it.

26
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,820
OK, if the income is three and the outcome is I mean I should have told you, you know what, let's

27
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,450
start over.

28
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,070
Let's say the income is three and let's say the outcome is one.

29
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,800
So three plus one, we are going to get four.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,060
And in here we have three.

31
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,620
So three divided by four.

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,490
Right.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,390
So let's go ahead and let's divide it.

34
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,980
We have three divided by four.

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,800
We get we get three quarters.

36
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,550
OK, so when the income is four and the outcome is one, it means that we actually have four quarters

37
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,230
of final quarter means like four parts of that pie.

38
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,100
Think of a circle like like divided into four parts.

39
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,110
Then one of those parts is going to be the outcome.

40
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,190
And three of those parts is going to be the income.

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,200
But what is the ratio of this?

42
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,350
The ratio is going to be point seven, five or three by four.

43
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:21,110
So I'm just going to comment it three by four, OK, because actually the whole pie or the whole circle

44
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,910
that we have is divided into four parts and the ratio drops three parts of that.

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,030
So what are the other what is the other part dedicated to that is dedicated to the outcome?

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,520
All right.

47
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,670
I hope you're not getting confused, so I'm going to go again.

48
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:44,420
So if the income is 100, like let's say the income is 100, the outcome is one.

49
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,620
This ratio is always going to be less than one.

50
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,890
It is always going to be less than one because the bigger number should be accommodated, should be

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,780
dedicated to the income.

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,880
And these the smaller number should be accommodated to the outcome or vice versa.

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,630
Doesn't matter.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,960
What matters is one of these incomes or outcomes should get a bigger number than the other one in case

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,580
both of them are equal.

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,540
Then we will get like a sort of like like an equal ratio for both of them.

57
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,390
OK, like a point five that we saw there.

58
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,180
OK, so let's go ahead and we are going to complete this and then we are going to play around with it

59
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,470
so we can understand it.

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,880
Now, inside here, I want to call the draw circle function twice.

61
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,460
First one, I'm going to call in the line green.

62
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:49,400
Lorne, green color for the income, OK, and the ratio, whichever value comes out of this excuse me,

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,910
and the anticlockwise is going to be true because whenever we are working with the ratio, we go from

64
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,730
here to here.

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,690
So this is anticlockwise whenever we working sorry with income, but whenever we're working with the

66
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,930
outcome, it is going to be clockwise.

67
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,420
So.

68
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:14,740
From here all the way to here like that, so it is going to be true and a next time where we are going

69
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,280
to grab it and we are going to set it to false right.

70
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,590
And we are going to change the color to tomato.

71
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,840
Now, keep in mind here that we do have a ratio of, for example, zero point seven five.

72
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,460
This is going to be the ratio, but we are going to say one minus zero point seventy five.

73
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,220
So one minus zero point seventy five is going to give us zero point two five.

74
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,490
OK, so zero point two five is our ratio.

75
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:54,490
OK, and we have said that three is the income and one is the outcome and point seventy five is going

76
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,920
to be divided between the income and the outcome.

77
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,080
Let's just go ahead and implement it.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,210
I feel like the more I explain it, the more confused you get.

79
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,830
So I'm going to come in here and say the update UI function and I'm going to call the update chart.

80
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,930
You can see that it's.

81
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,040
It can.

82
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:25,470
Detected and we are going to call in the end, come and come and out, say it, let's come here.

83
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,910
Let's just see it for ourselves.

84
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,830
Let's close this.

85
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:36,630
So if I were to person project for the project, let's say I have three add added.

86
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,900
We can see whenever the expense is zero, all of the circle is going to be dedicated for one of the

87
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,100
trackers, whichever is present and let's say dinner.

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:07:00,250
Let's put it to one, OK, now, this is the problem here, you can see that because dinner is one and

89
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,220
well, actually this is this it should and shouldn't do this.

90
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,290
I think we have done a mistake here.

91
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,890
We should see a whole circle here.

92
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Everything else is correct and is three outcomes.

93
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,940
One balances two dollars.

94
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,040
But we should see this expense come all the way here.

95
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,150
Get the one third of it.

96
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:33,330
So we have income and then we have the outcome, if we come inside the update chart, we have the one

97
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,360
minus ratio and draw a circle.

98
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Let's go ahead and let's add a negative sign to the ratio.

99
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:52,400
We still see that it's OK, we don't see it anymore, let's say Project South, let's add three and

100
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,240
come into expense, let's say dinner one and now it is working, right.

101
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:10,000
So you can see that the entire circle has been divided into four parts, one of the parts is dedicated

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,040
to this expense.

103
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:18,640
You can see that this is one fourth of the circle, three other fourths of the circle, three quarters,

104
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,360
not forts.

105
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Of course, three quarters of this circle has been dedicated to this three.

106
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,610
So what this is going to do is this is going to grab all of our incomes and all of our expenses.

107
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:38,230
It is going to sum them up and it is going to create a circle and the circle is going to have segments.

108
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,580
Each segment is going to be equal to one of the dollars that we have inserted here.

109
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,690
So if I reload this page, the circle is going to go away.

110
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,110
Now, let's go ahead and let's say project.

111
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,310
I'm going to say 1000.

112
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:02,300
OK, so now the circle has 1000 segments and let's say dinner and I'm going to pass in five and now

113
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,550
it means that this five is actually five of those 1000 segments.

114
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:17,090
OK, so 995 segments are dedicated to the incoming five segments are dedicated to the outcome.

115
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,730
That's why you can see them very, very small.

116
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,700
Let's go ahead and let's say Birrarung.

117
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,970
Brunch and let's say 1994, OK?

118
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,690
And if we do that, you can see that now because we had five here, you know, what can I deleted now?

119
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,620
I cannot delete it.

120
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,020
Can I edited nine, cannot edit it.

121
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,740
So I'm just going to reload the page and I'm going to explain it one more time.

122
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:52,450
So let's say we have a project here and it is you know what, 100 is better than 1000.

123
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
Let's say we have dinner.

124
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:05,150
And for dinner, we have five, but then we have brunch, and for the brunch we have 90, you can see

125
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,360
that 90 plus five, we get ninety five.

126
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,270
And the it's this income is going to be 100.

127
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,470
That's why if you pay attention, the income is a little bit bigger than the expense.

128
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,390
So if I were to add five more for the expense, lunch is going to be five.

129
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,350
Now both of them are equal.

130
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:35,750
The reason for that is we have 100 inside the project, 100 inside the expense, I'm sorry, 100 inside

131
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,990
the contractor, 100 inside the expense structure.

132
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,450
That's 200.

133
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,310
So this circle is made up of 200 because both of these segments are equal.

134
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,580
Equal spaces of this circle have been has been dedicated to each of these incomes and outcomes.

135
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,880
So this is how we create that.

136
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:03,620
The reason that we say minus one, because the result of this ratio is going to be a decimal, we basically

137
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,000
change through this.

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,430
We mimic changing it to like a like a ratio.

139
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,110
That's why it's a ratio.

140
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,710
All right.

141
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,540
So this is going to be it for this lecture.

142
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,860
I think there are only two things remaining here at this point.

143
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,930
The first thing is that.

144
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,710
Actually, three things, the first thing is we need to be able to delete the items.

145
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:34,180
The second is edit the items and the third is add them to the local storage.

146
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,970
See you guys in the next lecture.
