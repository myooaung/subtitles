00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.720
Welcome to the first part of coding an eye for the DOT connector game.

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.640
All right, so I'm in My Geass file, so right at the top where we have our game parameters, what I'm

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.950
going to do is, first off, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create to create a constant called

4
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.630
delay A.I. because we would like it to first highlight a side, then select that specific side.

5
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.590
Right.

6
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.860
And right after that, let's go ahead and let's create a time for the FBI as well.

7
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.140
So I'm going to say time I.

8
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.790
Perfect.

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.810
And if we go to our click function, we say that if it is not player's turn return, but we actually

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.500
we are checking for time and but we need to pass in the player's turn as well.

11
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.020
So I'm going to say players, if it is not player's turn or.

12
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.239
If it is if we are in the end game, we do not want to select any side.

13
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.690
It means that if the A.I. is selecting, we should not be able to select anything.

14
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.530
For example, if I selected something here so I decide, then it is going to be the ice turn.

15
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.220
But during that time, I should not be able to select any other side.

16
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.950
All right, so, for example, let's go ahead and it's like this, and I can see I cannot select now

17
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.740
I cancel it until the A.I. chooses or select suicide.

18
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.640
We should not be able to select anything.

19
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.170
There we go.

20
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.040
You can see that we cannot.

21
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.950
So and I think we do have another one of that as well.

22
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.880
And that is highlights side and go to highlight where is our highlight.

23
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.440
Great.

24
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.890
I think it's up top.

25
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.360
So I'm just going to this is highlights side, this is our new game function.

26
00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.940
This is highlighted.

27
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.830
There we go.

28
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.350
Here we also want to implement the same thing.

29
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.370
So if it is not player's turn or it is time and we just want to go ahead and we want to return.

30
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.830
Perfect.

31
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.070
So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and collapse all these functions first just

32
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.690
to make this navigation a bit smoother.

33
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.880
All right.

34
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:31.480
So this is a site and also the square class schraub, the draw squares, draw scores, draw a line,

35
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.840
draw a grid, draw a dot, draw board and finally click.

36
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.610
So what I'm going to do down beneath here, I'm going to create a function and I'm just going to call

37
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.320
it EHI.

38
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.280
Right.

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.610
So what this function is going to do is this function is going to contain our logic for creating this

40
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.010
A.I..

41
00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.370
All right, so now let's go ahead and let's create this function, so I'm going to come below this grid,

42
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.140
get grid Y and in here I'm just going to provide a comment and I'm going to say ehi function.

43
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.720
Right.

44
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.990
So this is going to be the eye function.

45
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.600
So it is going to be function, the name is just going to be I they're not going to be any parameters

46
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.050
in here.

47
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.490
They're just going to pass.

48
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.150
We're just going to code here.

49
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.060
So first off, I'm just going to pass.

50
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.790
And that if it is the player's turn.

51
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.940
All right, players turn.

52
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:42.130
In this case, the players turn as the turn of the eye to play or if it is time and then we don't want

53
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.030
to do anything.

54
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.700
We just want to go ahead and we want to return from this function.

55
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.600
Next up, what I would like to do is.

56
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.030
I would like to set up that delay that we have, so set up the delay and it is going to be time.

57
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.750
Time and I is going to be equal to the math, Dalziell.

58
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.330
All right, so seal and Mark, the seal returns the smallest integer, greater than or equal to its

59
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.390
numeric argument.

60
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.740
Right.

61
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.870
And we are going to pass in here our delay 80 times the frames per second.

62
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.700
So delay is one second frames per second is 60.

63
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.510
So it is going to delay the 60 frames and because we have 60 frames in one second.

64
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.650
So it is going to delay the eye by exactly one second.

65
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.140
Next up, let's go ahead and let's create a countdown until the computer makes its selection.

66
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.120
So I'm just going to say count down.

67
00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:04.380
Until the FBI makes its selection perfect and we are going to say f time II, Time II is greater than

68
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.840
zero.

69
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.520
We are going to grab time and we are going to decrement it.

70
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.620
And then within that if statement, we are going to check that F time.

71
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.000
If Time III is equal to zero.

72
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.830
If time is equal to zero, we want to switch the player now here, what I'm going to do is we are going

73
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.940
to select the we are going to grab the select side function.

74
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.080
But I'm going to commented out and I'm just going to hear for testing purposes, of course, for testing

75
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.660
purposes, just going to switch the player.

76
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.700
We're going to come in this one because I just want to test to see if this is going to work or not.

77
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.330
So Player's turn is not going to be the player start.

78
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.420
Basically, we want to switch and then we want to return from this function.

79
00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.520
Right.

80
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.100
So.

81
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.500
With that, let's go ahead and let's actually check this if we can't see anything, so if I come here,

82
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.160
I'm just going to reload this page and this is actually where we're working.

83
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.070
So I'm just going to I'm just going to close that one so I can see it is my turn.

84
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.990
And if I select something, it is the eyes turn and the air has to select.

85
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.010
But because we have not done any kind of coding for the the it doesn't select anything.

86
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.950
So let's go ahead and let's actually set up a a priority set up priorities for the year.

87
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:42.930
So priority Ts for the A.I. and based on these priorities the is going to make a selection.

88
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.270
It didn't because we did not set up any selections for the air, any priority.

89
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.820
So we are going to have first priority.

90
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.520
So I'm just going to ride them out here because you have to understand them.

91
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.990
Our logic is going to be based on these three priorities.

92
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:11.380
The first one is going to be to select a square that has that has three sides completed.

93
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.110
So the first priority is to select a square that has three sites completed.

94
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.460
And why is this the first priority?

95
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.680
Because whenever the selects the fourth side, the air is going to clean that square.

96
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.420
Right.

97
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.810
So that should be our first priority.

98
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.670
The second priority is to select.

99
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.630
A square.

100
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:44.730
Now, this is going to take in two conditions that has zero or so, that zero is condition one or one

101
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.940
is condition to sides zero or one site site completed.

102
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.620
So if it is zero, it means that it doesn't have any sites completed, then that is a safe square to

103
00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.300
celebrate.

104
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:06.060
But even if it has only one site completed, that is still a safe square to select.

105
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:16.350
And finally, the third priority and actually the worst of them or the are not the the not the good

106
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:23.510
scenario is whenever the eye has to make a selection and that selection will allow the user to score.

107
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.850
So we are going to select a square.

108
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:37.230
Square that has two sides completed, so we need to account for that as well.

109
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:44.100
And the reason that we need to account for this priority is whenever there isn't any square that has

110
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.840
three sides completed or or like it doesn't have any sites completed or at least one side completed,

111
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.820
then the one might make a move and our game would be stuck there.

112
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.810
We don't want to we don't want it to stuck there.

113
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.890
We want to make sure that there is a winner there.

114
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.740
So now let's go ahead.

115
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:15.120
And let's first off, we are going to set up so setting up the options array and within these options

116
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.940
that we are going to pass on these three priorities.

117
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.600
So first off, we are going to say options are going to be an empty threat.

118
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.020
And then the first item within this option is going to be an empty array.

119
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.060
And the same goes for the second.

120
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:39.050
And the third the third items within this and next stop, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say

121
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:45.320
populating Palm, populating the options are we need to populate it.

122
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.680
Right.

123
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.350
And let's see what we need to do here.

124
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:55.880
So first off, let's go ahead and let's iterate our squares array, because all the squares are there.

125
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.970
So we are going to settle for let I.

126
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:10.850
Equal to zero I is less than the squares that length, because it starts from Zero and Workington Tremendo,

127
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.100
I buy one each time.

128
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.550
Now let's go ahead and let's iterate over our columns as well.

129
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:16.980
All right.

130
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.100
So we are going to therefore let J equal to zero and we are going to say J is.

131
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.500
Less than the squares.

132
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:37.830
Squares, first item now squirter zero is going to be our first row and we will be iterating over to

133
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:44.070
the first row all the columns within our first row, all the columns within our second row and so on.

134
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:51.600
So we're going to start with our first row and we are going to say that J should be incremented by one

135
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.080
each time.

136
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.060
Now.

137
00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:04.680
In here, we are going to create a few a few cases now, these cases are created to make sure that the

138
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.550
eye chooses correctly and, of course, wisely.

139
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:16.480
So first off, now these cases are based on these sites or these priorities that we have created here.

140
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:22.680
So we are going to have case three, which means that a square has three sites completed.

141
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.760
We are going to have Chris sorry, Chris.

142
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.360
We are going to have case zero, which means that a square has zero sites completed.

143
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:37.760
We are going to have case one just going to either unless it means that a square has one site completed

144
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.690
and we are going to have a case two, which means Square has two sites completed.

145
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.720
So first, we need to check for all of them.

146
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.370
So we are going to switch.

147
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.330
And what is the array that we are looking inside?

148
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:57.490
That is going to be our squares area and we want to grab the the rows and the columns.

149
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:05.960
Now we have a number selected property that is going to give us how many sites have been selected in

150
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.180
case it is three.

151
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.180
It means that it is our first priority, what do we want to do in this case now?

152
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:25.010
In this case, we want to grab our options away and we are going to grab the first item because zero

153
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.610
is that.

154
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:30.140
And to that, we are going to push the square's array.

155
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.650
All right, and we're going to say squares.

156
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:44.560
Squares I and I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to copy this part because it's just a bit time

157
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.720
consuming to type it.

158
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.800
So then we have our break.

159
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.580
And now let's move on to our the other case now.

160
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.850
In this case case, a sorry square has zero sites completed.

161
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.570
And we are just going to breeze through this case to the next case, which which is one a square has

162
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.880
only one set completed.

163
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.610
Now, inside this case, we don't have any break.

164
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.480
So it is going to flow through zero to one.

165
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.750
So we don't need to really put it because the logic that we've provided is just for the second priority.

166
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:26.470
So this is second priority as well as the one above.

167
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.110
So let's just put it there as well.

168
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.780
Now, what do we want to do in our second priority and this second priority?

169
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:39.800
Basically, we want to grab all of that and push it to our second option, which is options one, and

170
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.810
then we want to break from it.

171
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.810
Just put it there, let's save it.

172
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.280
Yeah, it did indented.

173
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:54.470
And finally, we are at our third priority, which is the worst one, and it is going to be case two.

174
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.950
There isn't is two is because we have two sites completed.

175
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.480
I'm going to say third priority.

176
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.250
And in here, basically, we want to do the same thing.

177
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.790
Whenever we find something, we just want to push it to that.

178
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.380
And this should be so we have zero one and this should be two.

179
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.440
All right.

180
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.430
All right, so.

181
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:27.360
Next stop, what I would like to do as let's go ahead and let's actually make the A.I. to randomly choose

182
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.720
a side based on the priority or so before actually here.

183
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.390
I'm just going to write here randomly.

184
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:48.840
Randomly choose a site in priority order or based on the priority order, based on the.

185
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.010
Priority.

186
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.630
Or if it is misspelled, just forgive me for that, I just want to move on.

187
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:06.390
So for that, first of all, I'm going to do as we are going to create a variable called option for

188
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.760
each of our individual options.

189
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:17.900
And we are going to say if now if it is our first priority, we need to select from the options with

190
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.930
our options this one options zero index.

191
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.220
So I'm just going to grab that because this is going to be our very first priority.

192
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.820
And we are going to say that we are going to grab the length.

193
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.650
If the length is greater than zero, what do we want to do?

194
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.420
We want to make the EHI to randomly select a column.

195
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.000
Now, what is this prior to say?

196
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.040
It means that in this priority, we have three sites completed.

197
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.790
All right.

198
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.850
So it is going to be first priority right here.

199
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:56.910
When it is when there are three sites completed, the A.I. is going to be randomized when it comes to

200
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.480
columns.

201
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:04.800
And what does that randomization is going to give the it is going to give the a choice to whether select

202
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:10.200
the square that has already three sets completed or just to give that to the user.

203
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.070
All right.

204
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.230
That's why we are going to randomize it.

205
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.590
We are going to say options and it is going to be the zero.

206
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.430
So the row is going to be our row first.

207
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.990
That is why we are not going to change the row, but we are going to change the column.

208
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:39.510
So we are going to say math, dot floor and math dot random times the options.

209
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.990
Zero item, dot length, right?

210
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:52.300
So and so this is going to be whenever we have our first priority, what about the rest of them?

211
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.730
So let me just go ahead and copy that and let's just put it here.

212
00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:03.920
So in our second priority, what we have is when the options one, the length is greater than zero,

213
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.770
we want the option to be the options.

214
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.170
So this is going to be the wrong number two.

215
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.030
And we are going to passan number two here as well.

216
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:14.810
Right.

217
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.569
So it is going to choose from one of those columns.

218
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.900
And finally, let me just copy that and let's just put it here.

219
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.069
This is going to be two and.

220
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.410
Two and also two.

221
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:40.050
Perfect, so next up, let's go ahead and let's grab the squares, coordinates, and we are going to

222
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.390
pass on the coordinates for the A.I. to actually select them.

223
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.250
So let's see where we should put them.

224
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.000
So what?

225
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.640
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to put them down here and I'm going to call them getting the

226
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.800
squares, coordinates.

227
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.740
All right, so what do we want to do here?

228
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:09.010
I'm just going to initialize the variable and I'm going to say coordinates.

229
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:17.900
Coordinates is going to be our option, the option that the FAA has selected and then we are going to

230
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.880
call in a get free side, sorry.

231
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.560
Yeah, it is going to be get free site coordinates function.

232
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.730
We haven't created this function and we will be creating that.

233
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:38.570
And then we are because whenever the whenever either the EHI or the Are iSelect decide, they're going

234
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.760
to highlight it first.

235
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.830
So we are going to call in our highlight site and we need to pass an exposition, as you can see here,

236
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.030
and a Y position.

237
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:52.610
So the exposition is going to be the exposition of the coordinates and the Y position is going to be

238
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.410
the Y position of the coordinates.

239
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.480
Right.

240
00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:02.780
And next up, let's actually go ahead and let's create this function so we know what it is that we are

241
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.670
actually doing.

242
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.890
So I'm just going to collapse this.

243
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:15.780
All right, I did do that, I think so I'm going to grab that one, this one drawer side drawer sides

244
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.590
as well and highlight side, select side.

245
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:26.120
So after the draw sides here, I'm going to create a function and that is get free site coordinates.

246
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.370
This is going to be an area function.

247
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:39.270
Right, and in here, first off, we need varlet coordinates for each of the sites, so we have valid

248
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:45.180
coordinates, coordinates for each.

249
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.240
Of the site.

250
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:58.620
Perfect, so let's just remove that and we are going to call it coordinates bottom for the bottom and

251
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.230
we are going to say now this is going to be an an object.

252
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:10.220
The reason that it is an object is because we are going to pass in two properties for coordinates.

253
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.360
We are going to have X and Y.

254
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.230
And we need to posehn both of them right here.

255
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:24.000
So for the Sidebottom, what is going to be the coordinate sorry, when it is Sidebottom, what is the

256
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.660
X coordinate?

257
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.460
The X coordinate is going to be this the left plus half of the width.

258
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.190
So this W divided by two.

259
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.710
And what is going to be the Y coordinates.

260
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.890
The Y coordinates is going to be disturbed bottom.

261
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.660
We are selecting it in reverse, so I'm just going to pass and negative one.

262
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:50.130
And let's go ahead and let's create we are going to create these coordinates and we are going to leave

263
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.760
it leave it right here and we're going to pick it up in our next lecture.

264
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.210
All right.

265
00:20:54.390 --> 00:21:00.420
From continuing in our next lecture, then I'm going to say coordinates left.

266
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:08.220
And for this, we are going to have an exposition, which is this the left, this stuff left, and we

267
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:16.350
are going to have a Y position, which is going to be this top plus half of the height divided by two.

268
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.180
Perfect.

269
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:25.230
Let's grab the coordinates are right are Eigsti.

270
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.130
And for that we are also going to have an object.

271
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:38.840
Now, whenever we're moving towards the right, we tend to grab the light, the latest square within

272
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.510
that array.

273
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.140
So what we're going to do is you're going to say this, that, right, minus one.

274
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:54.530
And the Y position for that is going to be this top plus half of the height of the square.

275
00:21:54.770 --> 00:22:01.010
So this that height divided by two and finally the coordinates.

276
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:11.090
For the top is going to be what is going to be the ex, the ex is going to be this star left the left

277
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.150
position plus half of the width.

278
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.290
So this W divided by two and four.

279
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:23.380
The Y we are we are just going to say it is the start top.

280
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.270
So that's it for this naturalise.

281
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.880
In the next lecture we are going to pick up where we left off in this one.

282
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.560
So see you guys then.
