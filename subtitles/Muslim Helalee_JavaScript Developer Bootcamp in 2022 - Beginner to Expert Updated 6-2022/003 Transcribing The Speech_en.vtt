00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.640
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.070
In this lecture, we're going to implement the functionality of the speech recognition.

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.960
All right, so first off, let's go ahead and let's grab the elements that we need.

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.580
First off, I'm going to grab the trans corruption.

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.530
So it's transcription and I'm going to say document.

6
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.680
That query selector, query selector.

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.970
What is this?

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.720
It is going to be this diff that we have, right?

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.570
So it is going to be that diff.

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.570
And next thing the next thing is going to be our speech para speech paragraph.

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.610
Now, this paragraph I will be creating dynamically in here because we don't have an equivalent in here.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.270
We are just going to be creating a dynamically.

13
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.670
So we are going to say document dot, create aliment.

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.400
What is the ultimate name?

15
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.340
It is paragraph.

16
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.989
So first off, let's call our speech recognition.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.790
We are going to call it on the window.

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.830
So you just say window the speech recognition.

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.060
It's right here now because it's experimental and because it's not worth supporting Chrome as well.

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.230
What we are going to do is we are going to say window dot speech recognition.

21
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.720
Or window, sorry, Web kit, Web kit.

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.090
No, not here.

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.470
Window dot websocket, speech recognition kit, speech recognition, right?

24
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.940
So we either use this one or we use this one, whichever one is supported, speech recognition.

25
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.320
All right.

26
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.500
Now let's let's instantiate the speech recognition.

27
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.260
So we are going to say consed recognition.

28
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.100
I'm just going to call it a recognition and we are going to say new window, that speech recognition,

29
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.120
window dot speech recognition and this is going to be a class, right, that we are instantiating here.

30
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.020
Now, let's go ahead and let's cancel log this this recognition that we have added here.

31
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.470
Ruki speech.

32
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.370
I'm just going to say recognition speech.

33
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.000
Speech, let's Soviet.

34
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.150
So whenever we oh, we should start it, then it is going to work, so I don't you know what, before

35
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.550
starting this, go ahead and check it inside the console.

36
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.310
So we get the speech recognition in here.

37
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.420
We get a lot of things.

38
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.720
But we're we are working we're looking for as interim results.

39
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.230
And what interim results does is it is going to listen to our speech and get the results.

40
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.220
So I'm going to say

41
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.210
recognition, that recognition, speech, that interim results, we want to set it to true because by

42
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.190
default, it's false and we want it to grab the results that we are talking.

43
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.110
That's why we are going to set it to true.

44
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.430
Now, on the same recognition speech, we are going to add an event listener.

45
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.970
The event is going to be result and we are going to grab our event object as well.

46
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.230
Right.

47
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.440
And now whatever that we speak, they are going to be like our results.

48
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.710
Right.

49
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.410
And I want to put all of them inside an array.

50
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.000
So let's say concert speech.

51
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.520
I'm going to call a speech to text.

52
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.370
All right, and let's say a Ray Dart from from IDOT results and what do you think Iida results is going

53
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.920
to give us?

54
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.260
Now, I'm going to comment that one out and I'm going to say conserve the log.

55
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.430
E first off, let's just grab the E and Downbelow.

56
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.210
We are going to say, let's start over.

57
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.900
Recognition, recognition, speech.

58
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.040
Here it is.

59
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.630
Dot start.

60
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.980
Say it.

61
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.970
Perfect.

62
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.230
So if I close that and if I reload the page, you can see that it is asking for access to your microphone.

63
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.070
Of course you should allow it, otherwise it wouldn't work.

64
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.820
So let's say hello.

65
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.070
Hey there.

66
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.250
What is going on here?

67
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.610
We don't get anything.

68
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.100
Do we?

69
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.390
So the results, let's just say, are results.

70
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.560
Save it.

71
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:56.090
Hey, what's going on here, we don't get anything and we should get something, I don't know why this

72
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.540
event is not an event listener.

73
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.270
The results, let's just cancel logs.

74
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.270
Anything like one to three, like success.

75
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.370
Success.

76
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.870
OK, so this event is not firing at all.

77
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.040
OK, so what do we do with this one?

78
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.020
And this event, it should fire.

79
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.500
Why doesn't this event I mean, is not my mic working?

80
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.680
Oh, we have we have a lot of stuff here.

81
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.350
Now, my mic definitely works, so we are not getting anything inside the console.

82
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.140
No problems, recognition, speech that add evilness into it is result.

83
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:56.020
And then we have selected our event object and we have said set it to six have said console logs, success.

84
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.970
We are just listening for that.

85
00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.380
Right.

86
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.680
I mean, we should be able to get something from.

87
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.660
All right, all right, so we have our guests, I'm going to check if we have any misspelled so we have

88
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.400
speech recognition.

89
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.260
Perfect, it's perfect.

90
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.490
Their perfect, their perfect, their interim results.

91
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.540
Perfect shoe.

92
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.130
Should get success, so you know what, I'm just going to close this one maybe.

93
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.650
Because everything is all right, maybe it is because of that.

94
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.080
So and I'm going to open this up with Life Server and right here and I can see there we go, we get

95
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.500
the duck.

96
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.890
So two windows cannot be opened at the same time.

97
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.210
And then we can see that this count is increasing each time I say a word.

98
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.080
And what we can do is we can print our event object as well.

99
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.480
All right.

100
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.370
Perfect, and we can see that this event is being fired at now because the session is ended.

101
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.810
We cannot see this event being fired anymore.

102
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.960
So now you can see this this entire thing.

103
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.300
But the thing that we are interested in is the results from their speech recognition results.

104
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.000
And it says I right.

105
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.090
I said, all right.

106
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.110
And it got all right.

107
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.620
And the confident I'm not calm, 50 percent confident.

108
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.700
Let's try this over, OK?

109
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.180
Let's check this one out.

110
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.340
The confidence level should be higher.

111
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.010
Ninety seven percent.

112
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.650
There we go.

113
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.700
So you can see that we are basically looking for this transcripted thingy, right?

114
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.400
I'm just kidding.

115
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.430
We are looking for this TransGlobe or not.

116
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:56.540
You can print out the confidence every kind of there is a lot of stuff here, but I'm just going to

117
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.540
grab the text and we are going to print it.

118
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.240
So inside our speech recognition, we are going to go from the speech recognition to results and then

119
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.010
we need to loop over the results.

120
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.750
That's why we have indices here.

121
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.550
And then we are going to get the transcript.

122
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.920
So we need to do some sort of like for each or something like that.

123
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.240
So because we are going to do for each word, we need an array.

124
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.590
That's why we are we are going to create that array.

125
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.990
So it's going to be the results to this array.

126
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:35.059
And if I were to say console lock, speech to text, let's save it.

127
00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.539
And now let's go ahead and check it out.

128
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.290
OK, so if I come here, you can see, let's save it and notice, go ahead and check it out.

129
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.930
I said, let's go and check it out.

130
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:49.930
All right.

131
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.990
So this is inside an array, right?

132
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.800
And let's go over let's map this array.

133
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:02.560
So I'm going to come right here and I'm going to say dot map.

134
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.860
So because we have to end this is we are going to need two maps.

135
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.470
The first one, I'm just going to call a results.

136
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:15.820
And what it is going to do is it is going to give me the result, which has an index of zero.

137
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.460
So return a result that has an index of zero.

138
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:26.240
And you know what, for this one, we are not going to need because we are just returning one thing,

139
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.850
so we are not going to need any any kind of curly braces, we can just put a result of that.

140
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.150
And then I'm going to tack another map.

141
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.600
And what is this map going to do?

142
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:45.960
It is going to grab that result that we just received and it is going to give us results, dot what

143
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.070
it is that we're looking for.

144
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.100
Transcript.

145
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.800
There we go.

146
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.750
And because MAP is going to return an array, we need to convert it to a string.

147
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.780
So we are just going to call it the join and just put in empty quotes here.

148
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.190
So now we should be good with this one.

149
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.620
All right.

150
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.670
And now let's go over and added to this paragraph that we have created.

151
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.340
So the reason that I've used let is because we are going to change this paragraph multiple times.

152
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:28.610
So speech Parreira, you're going to say that inner text should be equal to speech to text.

153
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.350
And now we have created that parents should adopt it.

154
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.500
So we are going to say transcription does not append child.

155
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.540
What is that child?

156
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.280
It is speech.

157
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.780
Power speech.

158
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.830
Uh, PEMRA.

159
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:51.400
Save it and let's come here and now there we go.

160
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:59.110
All right, so there is a problem with this, and why is that, what is the problem?

161
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.670
The problem is once this session ends and, you know, you can see that I'm talking, it doesn't just

162
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.630
record it again.

163
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.240
It is just going to end there.

164
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.600
So we need to create is a session whenever and a session is one session is ended.

165
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.330
We need to create another session.

166
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.810
So first off, let's grab our recognition speech.

167
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:26.330
So what is that recognition speech, that ad event listener?

168
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:34.430
The event is going to listen when a session one session ends and then we are going to run and we are

169
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.140
going to start another session.

170
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.270
How do we start it?

171
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.670
We just say recognition, speech, dot start.

172
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.150
All right, so now you can see that we have a recession is started.

173
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.950
But there is still another problem that whatever I say next is going to.

174
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.360
Override what I've said before.

175
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.130
See, you can see that here.

176
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:08.590
So what we are going to do is we are going to wait until that is final, until a result is final, and

177
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.780
then we are going to create another paragraph.

178
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:22.420
So if either results, the first index, which is the zero index, is literally final, what do we do?

179
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:31.150
We grab our speech para and we are going to say document that could we create element?

180
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.920
We are going to create another element and that element is going to be another.

181
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.800
So that's how we are going to get multiple PS inside our inside our website.

182
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:50.340
All right, so that's the next line is actually the next paragraph, and if you wait for like three

183
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.470
seconds, you're going to start another session.

184
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.490
All right.

185
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.470
Session for.

186
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.040
Session five.

187
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.560
Session six.

188
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:17.680
And so on, you can see and if you come here and take a look at what we have set inside the e-mail aliments.

189
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:25.490
Transcription, you can see that each one of these is actually a paragraph because we have said so when

190
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:31.070
the results is final, the next result is going to be a different paragraph than before.

191
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.890
So they should not override each other.

192
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:45.560
With this, our application comes to an end, I think that for those of you who whose language is whose

193
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:54.960
English, for those of you whose first language is not English and you're maybe like in the process

194
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.540
of learning it or you have learnt it.

195
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:07.540
The way that you can use this application is you can test your speaking skills and the better this application

196
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.220
understands you, the better.

197
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.270
Another person that you want to talk to is going to understand you.

198
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:20.710
So think of this for those of you whose first language is not English, for those of you who are learning

199
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.320
English, just speak to this.

200
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.570
I know it's not that accurate, but still it's almost like 90 percent accurate.

201
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.860
And you can see that right here, OK?

202
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.400
And it's almost like 90 percent accurate.

203
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:42.910
And whenever this application understands you, even though this application is is flawed, that another

204
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.570
person that you want to talk to is going to understand you as well.

205
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.360
All right.

206
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.170
So with this, our application comes to an end, and that's it for this application.

207
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.880
See you guys in the next one.
