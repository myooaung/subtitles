1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:07,120
Hi, everyone, in this that we are going to continue studying the properties and methods.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,070
All right, so back to our property, number four, so this property in this property, we are going

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,870
to traverse the dome.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,710
OK, now there are actually four properties, but I've just combined them into one because they basically

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,700
do the same thing.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,560
Either we go one step up or one step down or to one side or to the next side.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,560
So one step up is going to be the parent element.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,870
One step down is going to be children.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,680
Previous elements, sibling is going to be to the left.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,390
And next, a sibling is going to be to the right.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,370
So these are all traversing the dumb sort of properties.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,380
All right.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,100
So what I'm going to do is we are going to grab the concept that we have.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,010
We are going to grab our paragraph.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:04,569
And let's do a name for that variable, we're just going to call Okpara and say document.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:15,710
That query selector for as of now, we know what is our favorite way of grabbing any Estima element.

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,280
All right.

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,210
So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say cancel the log.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,370
Now, what do I want to log to the console?

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:32,720
I want to log to the console, the parent element of this P paragraph, tag or paragraph element.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,240
And I want to know the parent element of the Parro.

22
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,180
So I'm going to say parent element and I'm going to say and it is going to give me body, because if

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,790
you come to our e-mail, we see that we have in each one we have a para, we have an image and we have

24
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,330
a URL.

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:54,620
So Parreira, the parent of the parent element of the paragraph is going to be the body.

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,380
And when we hover over, it's going to show us everything.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,030
And in here, this is basically is an esteemed representation of the console in the console off our

28
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,750
Web page.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,360
So this is the parent I'm just going to go ahead and hit a comment here and I'm going to say one and

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm going to call it parent.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,920
Parent element.

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,100
All right, so this is the parent element, next stop, we are going to use the children elements,

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,730
so I'm going to call it, too, and this is going to be children.

34
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,990
All right, so in here I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab the body and we

35
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,060
are going to take a look at what are the children of the body.

36
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,060
All right.

37
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,610
So we are going to take a look at that.

38
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,400
So we are going to say const.

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:56,340
Consed body, not boy body, and we are going to say document that body, so to be able to grab the

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,160
body, we can just say document that body.

41
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:07,980
We don't have to do like any fancy query selector because there are some reserved selectors in JavaScript,

42
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,310
like native JavaScript selectors for the optimal alignment and for the body element.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,390
These are reserved, right?

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,130
So we can take a we can use them.

45
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,570
So we are going to say consider log.

46
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,940
And in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the body.

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,580
This is actually the element name that we are grabbing.

48
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,980
So I'm just going to give it body by the one and I'm going to say, what are the children?

49
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,470
And when I say it, we are going to grab an e-mail.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,720
We are going to see an e-mail collection.

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,480
And each of the children, they are indexed from zero all the way to five.

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,380
Right.

53
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:58,760
OK, so the length is six and it is an extreme element in our collection, so if we want to grab any

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,500
of these elements, we can just do our array methods, OK?

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,780
And we can use we can use the index to be able to grab that specific element that we want.

56
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,820
So what I'm going to do is in here, I'm going to say give me the element which is associated with the

57
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,690
index of zero.

58
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,709
And when I do that, it's going to give me this title and then.

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,880
You know what, I'm just going to zoom out the console, I'm sure it's still readable.

60
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:32,230
And we can go ahead and say, give me the element that is associated with the index of four and we are

61
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,010
going to grab we are going to get the script maybe like go ahead to three.

62
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,330
We're going to grab it.

63
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:37,830
You will.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,460
So you, Earl, is going to have a lot of allies, three allies inside of it.

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,120
Right.

66
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,970
So this is how we can grab children.

67
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,800
Next up, we are going to talk about the elements, siblings, previous elements, sibling and next

68
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,630
element sibling.

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,380
So I'm just going to go ahead and say three previous elements, sibling.

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,810
Now, siblings are the kind of elements which are on the same level.

71
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,580
So these allies, all of them are siblings of each other.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,010
Right.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,290
So this is a sibling of this, sibling of this.

74
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,960
And we have a previous element, sibling and the next on sibling.

75
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,950
So consider this funny.

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,520
The previous element sibling is this ally, which is loyal.

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,120
And the next element sibling is this good company, ally.

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,100
We can't select elements based on elements based on their siblings as well.

79
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,700
So what I'm going to do is I want to create a concern.

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,780
I'm going to name it item, and we are going to go ahead and we are going to grab the document that

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:49,730
query selector, and we are going to grab it because this inside these quotations or quotes is the realm

82
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,980
of Cyesis selector.

83
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,390
We can do any validity as a selector.

84
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:02,720
So I want to go into a manual and from there I want to grab any Daehlie, which is the ninth child number

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,320
two.

86
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,700
So I want to grab the middle one, the funny one, because this is going to illustrate better for us

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,870
the previous element sibling and the next on its sibling.

88
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,670
So both of them are going to come here.

89
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,950
Let's add another like this.

90
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,100
All right.

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,460
So now we have successfully selected our second item.

92
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,840
So let's go ahead.

93
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:33,560
Let's go to the console and I'm going to say item that previous.

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,490
Previous elements.

95
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,770
And it is going to give me loyal because if I solve the log.

96
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,190
The item itself, we should get funny.

97
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,630
So this is funny.

98
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,150
So this is the middle one.

99
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:56,840
The first one is going to be the previous and the last one is going to be the next.

100
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,370
So this this is how we can grab elements by either by traversing the dumb.

101
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,180
Right.

102
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,720
So this was our property.

103
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,060
Number four, we are going to take a look at one more property and then we are going to wrap this lecture

104
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,310
up.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,550
So for property number five.

106
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,440
I'm just going to sit here and I'm going to change it to five and in here.

107
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,930
Well, basically, this is the style of property and the style of property inside JavaScript allows

108
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,460
us to use this style inside the JavaScript file.

109
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:33,990
All right.

110
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,240
Now, changing Cyesis properties with Geass.

111
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:45,290
These styles will be converted to inline Cyesis, which have the highest specificity encases.

112
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:53,230
Everything is empty because there are no inline styles applied right now before even diving into that.

113
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,900
There are no standards applied here, but we can apply some styles there.

114
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,080
So if you go ahead and if we grab the image, all right.

115
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:11,050
And we say document that query selector and let's grab it by the element selector, which is image,

116
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,770
and I'm going to do one for the paragraph as well.

117
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,770
So let's put it there.

118
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,320
And this one is going to be P and let's call this Para.

119
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:33,120
So now if I go ahead and if I say cancel the lock, I am image and now in here, this is this is the

120
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,919
element that we are grabbing.

121
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,590
And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab the power as well.

122
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,440
And I'm not going to comment comment them out because I want to take a look at them when we apply styles

123
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,809
on them.

124
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,020
All right.

125
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,870
So all sorts of styles are camel cased in JavaScript.

126
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,030
This is something that I want to get it out in the open.

127
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,470
So if there are any styles which are which have two words in them, they cannot be applied until you

128
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,210
use camel casing.

129
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,620
All right.

130
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,190
So first off, let's go ahead and let's grab our image.

131
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,830
And for that, I'm just going to increase the size of the window a bit more, the chrome window.

132
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:19,650
So I'm going to grab the image and I'm going to say, dot, whenever we do dot, we reference or we.

133
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,350
Access either properties or methods, but style is a property, so I'm just going to stay up.

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:35,060
And now whenever you write style and head dot, these are all the Cyesis styles that you can ever use.

135
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,150
And now you can see everything is Kemakeza.

136
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:47,330
So if I come here to the top, we have an image delay and cyesis we have animation, dash dilli animation,

137
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,820
dash direction, animation, dash duration.

138
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,410
But in here they should be cummock.

139
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,420
So when, when you do style dot you are accessing all Sears's properties.

140
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,800
And this is how cool Dom as it allows you to access all the elements.

141
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:10,390
And all they see is his properties, so in here, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say with

142
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,090
and I'm going to set it to five now, let's set it to 700 pixels.

143
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,630
And when I say it, boom, you just saw this image get bigger.

144
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,590
This image is bigger, right?

145
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,300
We can do a lot more properties.

146
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,690
We can do whatever we want.

147
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,460
So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say back ground color this

148
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,890
one, and we are going to set it to thisll.

149
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,130
But I want this to be applied on the para.

150
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,830
Let's save it.

151
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,560
And now it has a background color of thisll.

152
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,220
All right.

153
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,320
We can go ahead and apply some.

154
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,760
Parting on the paragraph as well.

155
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,490
I'm just going to say parting, but this is not the optimum way of doing it, but you can do it.

156
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,220
And I'm going to add like 20 pixels of padding all around so you can see how this is this is changing.

157
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,740
And and whenever you change that, inline styles are applied in here.

158
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,870
So this is style, background, color, thisll padding to any pixel.

159
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,240
And these styles, they have the highest specificity.

160
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:29,110
So you should be careful when using these these dots style in line style of the JavaScript for success.

161
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:29,860
All right.

162
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,150
So now you guys can see that these properties, this with is 700 pixels.

163
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,720
It doesn't matter how many times you you set it to here.

164
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,670
If you set it to like tenth, 1000 or 10000, it's always this inline style is always going to be applied

165
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,400
because it has the highest specificity.

166
00:11:50,380 --> 00:12:00,760
We can provide, I don't know, like some color, it's a color should be let's set it to white and the

167
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,520
color is white, we can apply some.

168
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,040
Well, it is it shouldn't it shouldn't be white.

169
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,950
And let's let's go ahead and let's set it to blue.

170
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,690
Let's color this is also let's change this and that one will be applied.

171
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,210
We are going to say line.

172
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,570
Height, let's set it to one point eight, one point eight.

173
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,080
Let's say that the color is blue, very, very terrible design it.

174
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,880
This illustrates that I'm not good at design.

175
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:38,470
So we end Fadela for the final style that we we are going to add is font size.

176
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:49,000
So these double words or multi word Cyesis styles, they should be cavalcades if you want them to work

177
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,720
and it should be 20 pixels.

178
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,500
And when I say that they just get bigger.

179
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,340
So we can do this as well, but this is not the optimum way of doing it.

180
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,760
All right.

181
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,940
Now, what is the optimum way of doing styles with JavaScript is the topic of our next lecture.

182
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,940
See you guys in the next one.
