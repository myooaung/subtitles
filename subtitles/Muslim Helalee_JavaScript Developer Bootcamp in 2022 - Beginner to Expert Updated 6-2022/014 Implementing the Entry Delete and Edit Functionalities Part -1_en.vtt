00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.780
Hi, everyone, in this we are going to implement the delete and the edit entries functionality.

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.530
All right, so this how does this actually going to work?

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.830
I'm going to go into console because we might end up with some errors.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.880
OK, I'm going to tell you beforehand and we should end up with errors because I want to show you something.

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.170
So I want to be able to click this trash icon and this item to be deleted.

6
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.600
And I want to be able to click this edit icon and this item should come in here.

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.860
I can edit it.

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.760
So whenever the icon item comes, the entry comes here.

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.560
It should be deleted from here.

10
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.910
And then when I edited and added, it should go back there so I can just show you here.

11
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.660
So when I click on the trash, the item goes away.

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.680
But when I click on the edit, you can see the item is deleted from here.

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.760
Everything is zero.

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.430
When I just updated with 2000 and added, the item is re added.

15
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.270
OK, so how can we click on these icons now, these icons, they are not like inline icons, they're

16
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.040
like a difficult kind of icons.

17
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.450
They are dynamic icons.

18
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.890
So we have created them right here.

19
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.910
So there is no way for us to, like, grab them.

20
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.800
So what I'm going to do is actually, you know what?

21
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.770
What I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the list inside, which we have our icons.

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.590
And from there we are going to keep clicking around until we find these icons.

23
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.400
Right.

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.660
So if I come, I'm going to come beneath these event listeners because we are going to add event listeners.

25
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.670
And if you remember, we had stored all of our lists inside.

26
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.050
This lists variable.

27
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.450
So I'm going to call the lists.

28
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.190
So I'm going to say lists, event lists.

29
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.770
And you're right.

30
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.350
So we are just calling it right here.

31
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.930
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all of the lists and I'm going to say for each and I'm

32
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.220
going to run a function.

33
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.350
The function is going to is going to have a parameter of list.

34
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.330
And on this list, I'm going to say add event listener.

35
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.090
The event is going to be is going to fire on click.

36
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.680
And when the click is received, we want to run a function, we are going to grab the event object because

37
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.410
we need to target those icons.

38
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.860
OK, so in here, what I'm going to do is first off, I'm going to say cancel that log e let's go.

39
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.310
Hey, let's go step by step.

40
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.620
So if I come here and if I click on this, we are going to get this.

41
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.090
It is going to give us, like, everything that we need.

42
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.380
But from here, let's go ahead and let's go into Target.

43
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.130
Target is going to give us that specific icon.

44
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.880
Right.

45
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.330
But we need to know that if we have clicked on any of these icons, we want to do something.

46
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.280
And if we have not clicked on them, we don't want to do anything because this event is this event has

47
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.810
been appended to this entire list.

48
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.760
So even if I click here, we are going to see the event fire click, see the event is being fired.

49
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.410
We don't want the event fired there.

50
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.330
We want the event to fire whenever we click on any of these icons.

51
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.100
Other than that, we want to wrap up the function.

52
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.270
So even if I click here, you can see that the event is being fired.

53
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.750
But I just I just want the event to fire when I click on either of these icons.

54
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.900
So if I come inside this target.

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.330
So let's click on the edit.

56
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.320
If I come inside this target, this is a property that we have from the target.

57
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.160
Let's go ahead.

58
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.630
Now, we have done the local name, right.

59
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.940
But that Routh was really long path and then pass in the index and all that.

60
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.590
I found out that there is local name inside this target as well.

61
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.000
So if I come here, the local name is the element name.

62
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.380
The local name is I.

63
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.550
So I could see the target and inside the target local name.

64
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.340
Now let's go ahead on this click.

65
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.510
So for the U.

66
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.130
For the list, I should get a UL, which we do for the elai.

67
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.450
We should get on Ally.

68
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.970
Sorry, this is the diff.

69
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.160
So this should be really OK because this salary is inside one div, this icons, these are inside another

70
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.900
div that has a class of action.

71
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.250
So this is a diff.

72
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.460
This is I, this is I.

73
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.490
This is Elai.

74
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.060
You Well you, you, all of that.

75
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.770
You are so based on this we can run an if statement.

76
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.890
All right, so before even doing the statements, I want to show you some more council logs as well.

77
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.540
So the other council log that I want to show you here is going to be the attributes.

78
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.920
So either target DOT attributes, we can grab the attributes as well.

79
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.930
I could show you I mean, like I should show you first.

80
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.550
So if I click on this, the event is fired.

81
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.320
Let's go into Target.

82
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.520
This is the event target.

83
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.410
And from the target, let's go into attributes a double T..

84
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.240
So inside the attributes, we are going to have access to all of the attributes.

85
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.760
So we have like a class and then we have this.

86
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.290
So inside the class we can say dot class.

87
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.580
We are going to grab all the we are going to have all this all this information.

88
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.750
But what we need is what is the value for that class?

89
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.130
Because the value for the class is actually what it is.

90
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.090
The class name.

91
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.720
It is exactly like an e-mail and a statement.

92
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.170
A class has a name and has a value, hence the value.

93
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.680
So we are going to grab this.

94
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:24.900
And if I just pay attention to this, it is a Ardeche sorry if I are space f a dash edit.

95
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.760
And if I come here on top of this application, we have stored that inside the edit icon and this is

96
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:41.400
that we have stored it inside here, inside this at first and like in the first lecturer's of this project.

97
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.630
So we have stored this class name here and this is the class name for F a trust.

98
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.620
So if you followed the same route, we are going to grab that trash.

99
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.000
We are going to reach it as well.

100
00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:08.130
So e dot target, dot com attributes, dot class dot value is going to give us this.

101
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.140
Right.

102
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.010
So I'm just going to show you once for one of them.

103
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.410
I'm sure this is clear.

104
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.210
Now, where are we?

105
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.060
Here we are.

106
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.490
Target dot com.

107
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:30.510
What was that was attributes, attributes, dot class, dot value.

108
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:37.530
So if I excuse me, if I click on this, we are going to get a list.

109
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.050
This is the class for that.

110
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.790
The class of the Ullas list.

111
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.900
The class of the ELA is income, if you remember correctly, from our dynamic element, because the

112
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.110
class of each of the allies depends on which list they are in.

113
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.130
So if they are inside the income list, the class is income.

114
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.100
If they are inside expense list, the classes expense.

115
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.600
If I click on this trash, this is the class for the trash.

116
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.410
This is class for the edit.

117
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.210
We need these classes.

118
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.770
All right, and before writing, there was one more concert, the log that I want to show you, because

119
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.820
I want you guys to really understand what it is that we are doing here, concert log.

120
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.150
And I want to say dot e let's let's go ahead and let's check it out.

121
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.160
So what is it that we want to do?

122
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:33.470
If I click on this Strache icon, I want to remove this illi, but what is the relationship between

123
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.820
this entire Illi and the Strache icon?

124
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:45.110
We can visualize that from our this element that we have created here because this is our elai so we

125
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.360
can see inside the light we have a div that varies depending tak for that def.

126
00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.310
Oops, I should have done this, you know, STEM elements, they work without closing tax, but this

127
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.260
is a best practice to provide closing tax.

128
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.450
Just a fun fact.

129
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:14.680
And so the eye has a parent node, which is this Sadef, and this div has another parent node, which

130
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.490
is this ALLAI.

131
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.560
So this is a a like a grandchild of this illi.

132
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.130
So two levels up is going to be alive.

133
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.360
Remember, two levels up.

134
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:34.120
So let's come here and say the E let's go ahead and let's try to visualize it here.

135
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.610
So e dot dot target.

136
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:44.190
That parent note is going to give us the first level of parents, the first parent OPIS.

137
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.730
So this is the parent node.

138
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.310
You can see that it is the div with a class of action.

139
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.180
But what is the parent node of this div with a class of action?

140
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.950
It is the ALLAI.

141
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.520
And this is the.

142
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:04.050
See, this is the entire line, so whenever we click on the icon, we want to delete the parent of the

143
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.360
parent of this icon, very, very simple, so we can pass it in here as well.

144
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.580
Targeted parent.

145
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:19.070
No doubt, parent, the first parent note is going to give us the divide with the class of action,

146
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.970
the second one is going to give us the ally that we want to delete.

147
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.040
So, OK, this page is loading, let's wait for it.

148
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.110
So when I click on this, we get the ALLAI.

149
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.130
When I click on this, we get the Allai are ready, right.

150
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:42.060
When I click on this div with a class of we get the second parent doesn't matter.

151
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:42.520
Right.

152
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.130
So the usual is right here.

153
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.280
This is the first parent and this is the second parent that we got.

154
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.670
But that doesn't matter.

155
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.680
What matters is whenever I click on this trash, we get the ALLAI.

156
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.290
We have successfully found this.

157
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.540
Aliment, however, this is something else.

158
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.050
All right, so now let's go ahead and let's write our FEMA.

159
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:14.580
So we say if either target we have done this, the local name is not equal to I.

160
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:24.030
Return, so if what the user has clicked on doesn't have a local name.

161
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.810
If I just return, we can consider log this as well.

162
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.770
One, two, three.

163
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.240
So it doesn't matter where I click, we can't see one, two or three.

164
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.330
But if I click on this trash, we can see one, two, three.

165
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.430
If I click on this edit, we can see another one, two, three.

166
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.760
It doesn't matter where we click.

167
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.500
So we have limited the click.

168
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.260
I'm going to tell you why we need this if statement.

169
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.550
We don't really need it.

170
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.450
But this is like best practice that I like to do.

171
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:59.640
Now, what I want to do here is I want to grab the target button.

172
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.060
So the target button is the target button.

173
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.440
The trash icon or the target button is the edit icon.

174
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.270
We need to find out which is which.

175
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:19.420
All right, so keep your friends rich and your enemies rich and find out and wait to find out which

176
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.270
is which very wise words I'll try.

177
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.110
All right.

178
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:32.650
So we say either target attributes, attributes, dot class, dot value.

179
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.200
We know what this is going to give us.

180
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.420
This is going to give us the class for it.

181
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.160
And then we are going to run another statement as well.

182
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.820
Let entry be equal to.

183
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.950
Let entry be equal to the target at parent.

184
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.500
Note, not parent.

185
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.170
No, I just showed you what this is going to give us.

186
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:05.460
This is going to give us the ally, of course, and now let's create another one, which is the target

187
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:13.900
IED, OK, because when we click on the let's say let's say there is another item as well.

188
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:22.140
So when I click on this icon of two, one, two, I do not want to delete the salary of 2000.

189
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.780
I should delete that specific elai that for which I have clicked the trash.

190
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.230
I should delete that.

191
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:38.280
So that's why we are going to get the ideas were targeted entry date attributes the same routes as the

192
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.530
class dot idee, dot value.

193
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.470
We know what the ideas from this entry that we have created here.

194
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.970
That's why we have passed and the IED.

195
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.290
So this elai has an IED, OK, that Eli has an IED.

196
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.580
Excuse me.

197
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.670
So you know what?

198
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:04.650
I'm going to postpone the rest of this video, the rest of this functionality to our next lecture.

199
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.810
Hopefully we will get it done.

200
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.000
If not, we are going to create another lecture.

201
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:15.340
We don't care as long as this application works beautifully and you understand wonderfully.

202
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.830
See you guys then.
