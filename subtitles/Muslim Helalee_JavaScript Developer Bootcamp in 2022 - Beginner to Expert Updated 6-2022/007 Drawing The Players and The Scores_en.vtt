00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.490
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:10.060
In this lecture, we will be drawing the players and the scores, so first things first, I'm going

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.250
to go to our game variables.

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.220
We need to create this course for our A.I. and our eye.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.910
So I'm going to say let's score A.I., which is going to be the second player and score our AI, which

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.370
is going to be the first player.

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.170
So we have created this discourse.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.530
We need to call them somewhere, so I'm going to go to our new game function and the way I'm just going

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.220
to go ahead and comment about everything that we do not need.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.110
I don't think we are not just going to comment out this.

11
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:55.830
I'm going to comment of the constructor that contains the the drawer side, the drawer sides highlight

12
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.500
side, select side if we needed them.

13
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.510
We are going to, of course, open them.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.760
So inside our new game right below here, they're going to say score EHI is going to be initially zero

15
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.040
and we're going to say score.

16
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.520
Aaargh!

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.900
Is going to be zero as well.

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.800
So we are going to initialize them to zero.

19
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:27.090
And then we need to go ahead and we need to handle this score, whichever players turn it is we need

20
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.640
to handle score for them.

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.760
So I have put something in here and that is we said that we are going to handle scoring here.

22
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:45.120
So I'm going to say, if it is players turn player's turn, we're going to grab the score of the first

23
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.780
player and we're going to incremented by one else.

24
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.250
It means that that it is the computer's turn or the other players turn.

25
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.180
We are going to say score II and we are going to incremented by one.

26
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.830
Whichever players turn it is we are going to increase their score by one.

27
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.370
So now let's go ahead and its collapse this once more.

28
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.670
What I would like to do next is I would like to go ahead and create a draw scores function.

29
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.900
Right.

30
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.600
And let's see where we should put it.

31
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.380
So we do have our draw squares here.

32
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:35.220
And on top of the draw squares, I'm going to say draw scores, draw scores, let's say function.

33
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.860
This is going to draw the player, the score, everything.

34
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.880
So we're going to say draw scores.

35
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.610
We're not going to pass in any parameters.

36
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.970
So first off, let's check out which color it is that we want to give it.

37
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.790
Now, we are going to create a color eye, which is the second player.

38
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.640
So first off, we need to check for a condition.

39
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.850
The condition is, if it is colors, if it is the player's turn, then we want to show the light color.

40
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.760
If it is the if it is not the player's turn, we are going to show the other solid color.

41
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.870
So if it is the player's turn, if Blair's turn is true, we are going to show the color a light.

42
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.880
Otherwise we are just going to show color if we are going to do the same thing for the our eye as well

43
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.230
or the first player.

44
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.440
So we are going to say if the player's turn is true, we are going to show the color player.

45
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:44.780
Color player, and if it is not true, we are going to show the color of player color, player light.

46
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.430
This is going to handle for us this, for example, when it does the player once turn.

47
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.200
You can see the player, too, is faded out.

48
00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.840
When it is players to stern, it is like back on and the player one is faded out.

49
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.110
This is going to handle for us this.

50
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.290
And now let's go ahead and let's draw the text.

51
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.220
So we are going to call our draw text function, which is going to draw any kind of text for us.

52
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.930
The text now we need to pass and text.

53
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.839
The text is going to be text player.

54
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.280
And what is going to be the exposition, the exposition is going to be with

55
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.480
with times zero point twenty five, the Y position is going to be margin because we are talking about

56
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.040
the Y direction and margin is for we created margin for this purpose.

57
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:49.670
Margin time zero point two five, the color is going to be determined by the color or eye variable that

58
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.060
we created and the size is going to be the text size top.

59
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.850
Let's do the same thing for the other player, which is the AAA, we're going to let's let's draw the

60
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.840
score as well.

61
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.730
And so for the score, what we are going to do is we are going to pass and score.

62
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.000
Schoharie, So this is our eye, we are going to pass the score for that, the deposition is going to

63
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.820
be with Time's 2.5, but for the Y position, we wanted to come down a little.

64
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.640
So we have our player player right here and then the score is below the player.

65
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.670
So if this is point to five, this is going to be point six a little bit further there.

66
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.450
The color is going to be the same and the size is going to be let's increase the size and multiply it

67
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.950
by two.

68
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.710
So this is going to be for the for the first player and this is going to be the second player.

69
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.750
So the text is going to be text, I text, I perfect.

70
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.370
The width is going to because we want it to go all the way to the other side.

71
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.470
We're going to say multiplied by zero point seventy five, the margin is going to be the same.

72
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.060
This is going to be I and text size top is going to be the same.

73
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.620
The score is going to be a.

74
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.440
The width is going to be beneath there.

75
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:26.140
So, again, zero point seven five, the margin is going to be that and the score ehi and basically

76
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.470
that.

77
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.420
So let's save it.

78
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.300
Let's come here.

79
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.040
Have we call this function, this draw course?

80
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:43.340
All right, so DROs course we are not calling this function, are we?

81
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.560
We should call that function, right.

82
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.350
So we need to call it in here.

83
00:06:52.670 --> 00:07:00.710
So what I would like to do is right beneath there, I'm going to call our DROs cause function and it

84
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.140
should constantly dry, since I can see it is the player's turn.

85
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.120
That's why this color is highlighted.

86
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.080
Now it is the to turn player one.

87
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.010
Player two.

88
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.130
Now let's go ahead and score so you can see the score is one.

89
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.050
I get another turn.

90
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.330
The score is too perfect.

91
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.330
And let's put it there.

92
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.830
Let's put that one here.

93
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.750
Flattr one and player one.

94
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.990
The next thing and the final video is I mean, we do have some time here.

95
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.520
There is still seven minutes.

96
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.500
We have just worked on seven minutes.

97
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.970
But I'm not going to do that.

98
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.970
We are going to do that in our next lecture.

99
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:45.950
We are going to work with that draw that we need to go ahead and handle the the event whenever we end

100
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.370
the game.

101
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.050
Now, the end game is ended.

102
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.030
We should see a draw here and after two seconds, the game should restart.

103
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.600
So I'm just going to check this one more time and.

104
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.070
So that is going to be player one for that here player to.

105
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.740
And why does it always have to be draw?

106
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.270
Let's check for some other condition as well.

107
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.250
Let's make the player one when all of them.

108
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:20.270
So let me put this here and that one is going to come there.

109
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.500
So player one player, one player want and player one.

110
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.900
Perfect, it is four and this is zero.

111
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.580
All right.

112
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.080
So that's it for this lecture.

113
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.720
See you guys in the next one.
