00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,740
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create our generate password function.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,910
All right, so first of all, let's go ahead and let's create the function, the name is already specified,

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,700
which is generate password.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,100
The parameters are actually the arguments that we have passed.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,980
So I'm just going to pass it right here and then open up the function function block.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,330
All right.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:37,060
So first off, before doing anything, I want to console to the one I always say console to lock, but

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,320
it's actually I want to log to the console or print as as in Python or print to the console.

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,950
The lower case character counts.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,650
I just want to print this.

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,090
All right, so let's come here and let's let's you know what?

12
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm going to keep it here.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,930
And now we are inside the console here.

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,390
So let's go ahead and let's click on this.

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,530
If I click on one, if I click on this, what do I get?

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:14,800
I get all the character codes and associated with our lower case numbers.

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,300
So we have ninety seven all the way to 122.

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,070
So if I bring it here, it says ninety seven all the way to 122.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,760
Right.

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,330
So we get all those.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,950
So it means that our generate function is working properly.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,810
I'm just going to come out and I'm going to keep it there.

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,830
I'm going to create another variable.

24
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,280
The reason for this variable is that I'm going to tell you why.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,920
And it it takes its roots from this argument that I told you why we specify lower case, lower case

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,260
character quotes.

27
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,890
First, why we are going to use we are why we are going to give this.

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,160
This these character quotes preference over the others, and I'm going to tell you why, that's why

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,300
I'm going to set our character codes to exactly this variable.

30
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,640
So I'm going to say I'm going to call it Charcot's in general character codes, and I'm going to set

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,570
it to that.

32
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,300
And that set the reason for that is let's come into our final application right here.

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,070
So I'm going to reload our page.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,460
So everything is zero.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,340
I'm going to go to all the way to number 10.

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,720
Now, you guys can see that we have only specified our number of characters with which has nothing to

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,650
do with either with the with the password being lowercase, uppercase or or with the password, including

38
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,290
numbers or symbols.

39
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,950
So this number of characters is an independent variable that we are using here.

40
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:56,510
So before clicking on any of these checkboxes like numbers, symbols, uppercase, even before clicking

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,690
on those, we can still create a password, we can generate a password.

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,520
And when I click, we have a password here.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,780
And when I click again, we are going to get another password now, this password doesn't include uppercase,

44
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,100
does not include symbols and does not include numbers.

45
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,790
So this is a lowercase password.

46
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,330
So by default, so what?

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,170
What does it mean?

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,430
It means that by default, when the user doesn't want to include numbers, symbols or uppercase, the

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,970
user is going to get a lowercase password.

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:42,130
I hope you're following, so our default password style is going to be lower cased, that's why we are

51
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,840
giving this lower case precedence.

52
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,090
OK, so if I go, it doesn't matter how many times I click, it is going to only show me lowercase letters,

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:53,720
right?

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:02,550
That's why I have set initially the character codes initially is going to be set to our lowercase character

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,580
codes because when the user has not checked any of those checkboxes, the user should be able to see

56
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,060
some sort of password.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,700
It's not like when these are not checked, the application should breakdown.

58
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,149
No, no, no.

59
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,620
We don't want that to happen.

60
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,530
We want the user to see some sort of password, even if nothing is checked, for example, even if the

61
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,930
number of characters is a default.

62
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,270
So let me reload.

63
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,370
And when I click, we are just going to get a password.

64
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,480
I know it's only one character, but that's not the point.

65
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,990
The point is this one character is lowercase.

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,900
So by default, the default password style that the user is going to get is going to be a lowercase

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,000
password and the number of characters is irrelevant of the rest of them.

68
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,070
So I'm not I'm not talking about this.

69
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,860
We talked about this in our very first JavaScript lecture, and that was the synchronization and that's

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,020
it.

71
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:57,850
All right.

72
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,130
Now we are talking about the rest of them.

73
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,560
So we have lowercase, no symbols and uppercase.

74
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,920
OK, so now that that's clear, we are going to come down and we are going to control the flow of this

75
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:17,690
application through of statements, so we are going to say if include numbers is true, what does it

76
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:17,960
mean?

77
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,360
If it is it has been checked, then it is going to evaluate to true.

78
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,150
So when this include numbers has been checked, what do we want to do?

79
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:37,330
Let's open our if statement block and now we are going to grab our character codes and we are going

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,550
to concat tonight, this array to it, because this include numbers.

81
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,680
It is going to when this is true, it means that when this has been clicked is the include numbers,

82
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,450
they include numbers comes from numbers element that value.

83
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,790
All right.

84
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,730
We have specified that here.

85
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,810
So this is include numbers that value one that has been checked.

86
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,060
When the value is true, then what do we want?

87
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,590
We want the character codes to be to have another array added to it.

88
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,900
Why and why another array, you might ask?

89
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:20,830
Because originally the value of the character codes is lowercase character codes and lowercase character

90
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,960
codes is going to give us an array, see an array from low to high.

91
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,770
Where does this array come from?

92
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,640
It comes from this function that we have created here.

93
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:40,990
So when the initial value of character codes is set to an array and we want to add on to that, right,

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,670
so we are going to use our concat method and why you might say that we want to add on to that.

95
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,420
Why not just set it to to this to this numbers?

96
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:58,070
Because the reason for that is whenever we create on this, we are going to see a lowercase password.

97
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,520
But when we say no and let's set it to 10 so we can talk about it, when we say include numbers and

98
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,560
claque, we can see that we have numbers and lowercase.

99
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,580
Right.

100
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,910
It's not like when you when you click on the numbers, then the lower case is going to go away and you're

101
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,310
just going to have numbers.

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,280
It's not like that.

103
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,930
We want a combination of both of them.

104
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,800
So when we click symbols, it's not like numbers and lowercase, they go away and we only end up with

105
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,230
symbols.

106
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,760
No, no, no.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,580
We want a combination of lowercase numbers and symbols.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,320
That's why we are going to add them on to each other.

109
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,020
Right.

110
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,570
So we are going to concatenate and what is it that we are going to concatenate?

111
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:48,110
It is going to be the number character codes that we have created in here.

112
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,780
So we have created these character codes and we are going to reference them inside our generate password.

113
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,260
That said, that's basically what we are doing here now.

114
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,680
Now that this if statement is completed, this basically runs one line of code so we can even simplify

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,040
this.

116
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,260
Let's remove the block and let's put it on the same line.

117
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,410
And when we save it, it's just going to basically do the same thing.

118
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,220
It's more readable this way.

119
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,550
So let's copy it two more times, so we have include numbers, then we have to include symbols.

120
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,250
What is that?

121
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,230
Include Assemblance.

122
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,100
Do we have this variable include symbols?

123
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,520
Yes, we have it right here.

124
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:38,990
So when they include symbols is true, we want our character codes to be concatenated.

125
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,530
By what?

126
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,270
By the symbol.

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,170
By symbol character codes, so we write it correctly, where is it, symbol, character code.

128
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,650
So let's copy it.

129
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,890
Yeah, it is correct.

130
00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:01,700
And when the password if the password includes uppercase, include uppercase, we want no character

131
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,310
codes to be added or to merge with with this upper case.

132
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:07,760
Right.

133
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,950
With this upper case that we have created on top.

134
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,540
So it is going to be uppercase character codes.

135
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,610
So let me grab this and this should be highlighted.

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,170
Yes, it is highlighted.

137
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,000
All right.

138
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,740
So now we have created our program flow.

139
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,680
Now we know how we can access that.

140
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,710
But how can we actually know?

141
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,650
Technically, we can generate a password at this point in time.

142
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,980
But the problem here is that we have no way of making that password random.

143
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:50,630
So each time that the user clicks this, this this should show us a random password that we are going

144
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,090
to implement our next in our next lecture.

145
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,290
See you guys then.
