00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,070
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,750
In this lecture, we are going to draw lines, arcs and circles.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:17,490
All right, so we have the exact same styling for our e-mail elements, and canvas is basically the

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:17,800
same.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
So that's come into our JavaScript.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,650
So in the JavaScript, again, we have selected the canvas.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,690
We have initialized the 2D context.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,420
The Highton with are the same.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,840
What we are going to do is we are going to draw lines, draw arcs and draw circles.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,970
Now this is a link to a website.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,430
This is Mathis's fun fun.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,210
And we are going to go over this over the irradiance.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,030
Right.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,950
So first off, how can we draw a line now?

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,590
The first thing that you need to do is always just get the canvas context because all of them are reliant

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,440
on this one now for drawing the lines, for drawing lines, arcs and circles.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
First, you need to begin path.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,180
You need to start a path.

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,900
Now the path is just started.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,260
It it doesn't have any coordinates yet, but it is started.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,010
Right.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,400
And then now when the path is started, what is the initial points for that path?

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:20,370
Because this is a 2D context we need in XPoint and we need a waypoint or a horizontal point and a vertical

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,830
point.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,660
So what we're going to do is we are going to say get a canvas context move, too.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,170
So this is where the position is.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,780
I'm just going to say 250 by 250.

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,590
Right.

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,890
And now now this is the starting position.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,320
Right.

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:47,400
We say that our begin path should go should move to this coordinates and it should start the path and

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,230
where it should go to it should go to get that canvas context line, too.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,150
Right.

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,940
So where do we want it to go to?

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:04,910
We want it to go to 400 to move along the extraction and 350 along the way.

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,160
So when it starts from 250, it goes by this distance and in each of the directions now.

37
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,750
Still, we don't have any life style for our line, if I save it, we are not going to see anything.

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,970
So let's grab our context.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,120
And we are going to say stroke's style, right, because lines, they don't have any dimensions and

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,210
they just they just have strokes, right.

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,860
And it means like we we don't have to say, like, fill that line.

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,740
We just say like like lines are like borders.

43
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,320
We just have to specify the color for them.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,080
And I'm going to set it to white.

45
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,040
And finally, in order to draw the line.

46
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,760
Now, all of these they were this has started the path.

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,340
The path should start from here, go to here.

48
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,080
But what is the method to actually draw that line?

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,890
It is the stroke method.

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,420
So if I save it, we should see some light.

51
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,200
So you can see that the line starts from 250 along the x axis and what was.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah, 250 along the Y axis.

53
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,590
And then it moves to 400 along the X axis and 350 along the Y axis.

54
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,650
Right.

55
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,740
And so this is our first line.

56
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,930
I'm just going to say a line one.

57
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,480
You can't create jobs.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,600
You can't create as many lines as you want.

59
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:34,120
So by creating if you want to create more lines, you just say a line to whatever line to.

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,240
And I'm going to say a line three, line four, line five, line six, line seven.

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,600
So what about line two?

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,390
We want the line two to be 600.

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,690
So we're going to put it 600 and 150.

64
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:02,500
So it should go up, right, because it is going to decrease its height from 350 to 100 to 150, the

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,370
line number three.

66
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,990
So I'm just going to for a sec.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Oops.

68
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,570
For a second, I just want to commend those ones out, and you can see that it decreases its height

69
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,700
because it went from 350 to all the way to 150.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,890
So the line number three is going to be I want it to go 700 and the extraction and 450 in the Y direction.

71
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:41,990
Line number line number four, I want it to go 1000 in the extraction and 50 in the Y direction.

72
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,060
So it goes really, really up.

73
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,440
Then I want it to go 50, 100 along the X axis and 250 along the Y axis.

74
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,150
Now you can see that at this point it has increased its horizontal distance and it is coming down from

75
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,600
the top.

76
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,420
So it's 50 and now it's 250.

77
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,280
The other line can be 250.

78
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,440
So now you can see that it goes back in the negative direction and this is going to be 650.

79
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,770
It has come way down.

80
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,730
So if I save it, where are we?

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,230
We are right here.

82
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,920
You can see that.

83
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,230
Right.

84
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,540
So this is what is that, 250?

85
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,280
And this is 650.

86
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,490
Right.

87
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,140
And finally, what I want to do is I want to create another another line here as well.

88
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,340
And I'm going to call it six.

89
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,500
And I want it to be 650 and then 650 to 250.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,550
And finally, line number eight should be 250, back to 250.

91
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,080
And I'm going to call this line number eight.

92
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,930
So let's save it.

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,420
You can see that we created this.

94
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,440
So this is a basic drawing here.

95
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,560
Now, this is drawing lines and then we have drawing arcs in the drawing arcs.

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,550
What we have is we have radians instead of degrees.

97
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,570
So what irradiance?

98
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,520
This website is really fun.

99
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,450
It explains in a very simple term.

100
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,450
So the angle made when the radius is wrapped around the circle.

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:23,660
So this this angle that you can see when if if we get this radius and wrap it around the circle, like

102
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,390
literally around this angle, then the angle that we get is one radius.

103
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,620
And here is the animation for that.

104
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,180
So if I click play, you can see that it is being wrapped around that angle.

105
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,650
And this is one radion.

106
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,570
I can I can show you this.

107
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:46,010
I have to show you this as well, because one PI is three point one four one five nine or three point

108
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,460
one four one six and half a circle.

109
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,540
Half a circle is pi radians or one hundred and 180 degrees.

110
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,510
So one entire circle is 360 degrees, but half a circle is hundred and eighty degrees.

111
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,840
One entire circle is two is to pi r or two pi radians.

112
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,210
Half a circle is one pi a radius.

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,800
So if I click on it and why is it three point one four one six.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:24,290
Because we get one radion two radion three irradiance and this little part is one four one six point

115
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,370
one four one six.

116
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,430
So if I click on it this is one radion two radians three radians and then three point one four six.

117
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,090
It's five radians which equals one hundred and eighty degrees.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,380
All right.

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,280
And there is a lot of information in here that you can go over.

120
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,990
And this is really, really fun.

121
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,100
And it's this one.

122
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,790
Radion is fifty seven degrees and it proves it to you why it is that it is going to get right.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,550
So this is actually a gradient.

124
00:07:52,790 --> 00:08:02,150
So if I say if I grab the PI because in JavaScript PIs are not pi degrees, they are pi radians.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,790
So one pi radion is 180 degrees which is half a circle.

126
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,160
So if we were to create one entire circle we should say PI times two.

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,640
Right.

128
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,370
We should multiply it by two because 180 degrees multiply by two degrees we get we get 360.

129
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,930
So let's go ahead and create that.

130
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,400
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say canvas.

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,280
Canvas.

132
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,659
Canvas context, but I'm going to begin the path I know we have already begun the path, but this is

133
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:47,300
a different path and if I do not begin, then the circle will attach itself to these lines and I can

134
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,050
show you that.

135
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,440
All right.

136
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,250
So I'm going to say canvas context, that arc.

137
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,590
So this art creates arcs and creates circles.

138
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,130
So first off, we get the horizontal and vertical dimension positions.

139
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,370
So let's say I want it to be 750 along the x axis and 350 along the Y axis.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,290
Then we need to get it.

141
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,250
The radius.

142
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:20,700
So radius is this so far from the center of the circle to the circumference of the circle?

143
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,200
That is the radius.

144
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,880
Right.

145
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:31,590
So radius, if you go if you connect one part of the circumference of the circle and move past through

146
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:38,130
the center of the circle to the other part of the circumference of the circle, then that is going to

147
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,380
be one diameter.

148
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,430
Now, one radius is half a diameter.

149
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,970
Right.

150
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,290
So this is one radius.

151
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,190
This is this is the circle radius.

152
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,500
And this is how we circle is created.

153
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:58,530
So the radius is 50, it means that the diameter is going to be 100, diameter is always twice the circle,

154
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,500
then we get the start angle.

155
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,320
Keep this in mind.

156
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,450
This is in radians, not degrees.

157
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,480
And then we get the end entangle because we want to at first I want to create an arc.

158
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,190
Right.

159
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,300
I just want to create ARC here.

160
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,010
So for ARC, basically we just say multiplied by PI.

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:24,930
So the end angle is just one pi because we know PI is actually half a circle and this is an arc, half

162
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,980
a circle is an arc.

163
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,660
So I need to pass and pi.

164
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:27,990
Right.

165
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:38,700
But in JavaScript PI is a property of the math object that set the other variable that the other parameter

166
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,320
that we have here is anticlockwise or clockwise.

167
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,540
So if I said it's true then it is going to draw anticlockwise like it should be like this.

168
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,530
It should go from right to top then to left.

169
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,260
So if I save it and if I come here, we are not going to see anything because we have not called the

170
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,220
stroke method.

171
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,820
So can this context stroke?

172
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,470
Let's save it.

173
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,080
And now we can see this is anticlockwise if I put it to false.

174
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,860
This is going to be clockwise.

175
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,440
OK, so I'm just going to go ahead and remove it because we are concerned with drawing circles.

176
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,740
So by default, it's safe.

177
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,900
It is going to be and is going to be clockwise.

178
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:25,980
Right.

179
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,250
So we got the horizontal position, vertical position radius and mathaf.

180
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,490
So this is how we draw a circle now in case I remove the begin path.

181
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:44,050
You can see it attaches itself with this line because the line started the path, but we do not want

182
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,790
that to happen.

183
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,590
So this is our drawing arcs.

184
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,860
Now I'm going to come down to drawing circles.

185
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,320
Basically, we are going to have the same thing.

186
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,950
So I'm just going to copy it, put it here.

187
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,230
I'm going to change the positions.

188
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,210
So I'm going to say twelve hundred and to 200 in the Y direction.

189
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,550
Right.

190
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,060
So.

191
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,270
That part is clear, the radius is clear, the start angle is clear.

192
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,510
Now we want to draw a circle.

193
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,400
We don't want to draw an arc.

194
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,380
Now, half a circle.

195
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,360
We know half a circle is pi.

196
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,950
Now, an entire circle is going to be two times pi, two times half a circle, we get in a complete

197
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,390
circle.

198
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:34,660
So if I save it and if I come here, you can see that we get a perfect circle right now.

199
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,250
You can create as many circles as you want.

200
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,220
You just have to repeat this combo.

201
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,540
Right.

202
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,950
I'm just going to hit enter here and here, for example, for the second one, I'm just going to say

203
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,320
200 and 300.

204
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,870
I'm basically changing the positions.

205
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,770
All right.

206
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,330
And then I'm going to say 400 and 400.

207
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,220
And then I'm going to say.

208
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:07,430
600, 500, and finally, 800 and 600.

209
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,850
That's what it's come here.

210
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:17,440
So basically, we have created these circles, so now creating all these circles by hand manually,

211
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,110
not by hand, of course, like putting it in this way, it's not an efficient way of doing it.

212
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,660
Doing it in this way is not an efficient way of doing.

213
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,920
That's why in the next lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to discuss our second part of

214
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,750
drawing shapes randomly.

215
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:41,760
And in the second part, we are going to draw random lines, lines randomly, circles and arcs randomly.

216
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,420
Right.

217
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:49,360
And in case you're wondering, we will be coming back to this website over and over again, because

218
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,720
one of the most important aspects of game development with a team of five and can it's just him team

219
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,440
of canvas.

220
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,750
And James is actually doing a lot of math.

221
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,810
And I do not expect you to be good at math.

222
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,300
If if you are, then that's a bonus.

223
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:14,050
But if you're not, I'm going to I'm going to explain this stuff to you the way like in the way that

224
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,270
I'm going to assume that you don't you have nothing.

225
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,610
You have no knowledge of math.

226
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:26,740
OK, so I'm going to be explaining the mathematics part simply like in a beginner tone.

227
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,960
But the game development part and as far as the logic is concerned, of course, they are going to be

228
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:39,520
high level because we have done so many projects and we have covered so many advanced concepts of JavaScript.

229
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,110
And these the code should be simple right to you.

230
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,700
But if the math is not simple, I'm going to make sure that we go over it many times until it is clear.

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,440
All right.

232
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,740
So that's it for this lecture.

233
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,260
See you guys in the next one.
