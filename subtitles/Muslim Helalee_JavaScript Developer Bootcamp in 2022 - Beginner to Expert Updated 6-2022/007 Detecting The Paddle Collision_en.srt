1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,850
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,470
In this next year, we are going to detect the powerful collision.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:15,430
All right, so right after that, the logic that we have implemented right here, what I'm going to

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,540
do is I'm going to come to this everything manager function.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,200
And in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to call it player.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,620
So I'm going to say let a player be equal to now.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,770
How do we know which player do we want to choose?

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:38,230
Now, this player could be the R.I or the A.I. So why don't we, depending on where the ball is, we

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,670
can find out which player it is that we want.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,660
So if the ball is in the room, if there was exposition is less than the canvases with, it means that

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,550
the canvas width is bigger.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,420
The ball is in the eyes position canvases with the divided by two.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,170
So this is the canvas with the divided by two.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,270
This is one part of it.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,320
This is two parts of it.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,060
If the ball's exposition, for example, let's say this is the point of 300 pixels.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,030
So let's say the ball is right here.

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,340
It means that the ball's exposition is 300 pixels.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:12,940
Right.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,280
And the canvas is with divided by two.

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,070
Let's say it's twelve hundred pixels so that that part is bigger than the box position.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,430
It means that the ball is right here and otherwise the ball is going to be right there, right in here.

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:37,090
So if it is bigger than then the ball's exposition, it means that the ball is going to be in this side.

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,150
If it is less than that, it means that if the ball exposition is greater than the canvas with, it

25
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,810
means that the ball is right here.

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:55,900
OK, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say if Balls X position is less than the canvas, eliminate

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,640
width divided by two.

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,440
Right.

29
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,360
If this is true, the ball should be in which position the ball should be in this position.

30
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,300
Right.

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,570
Because we know that the canvas is bigger.

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,450
The can there for example, here, the canvas is 600, the ball is 300.

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,660
So the ball is right here.

34
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,200
And when it is when the ball's X position is bigger, for example, the canvas right here is twelve

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,520
hundred and the ball is fourteen hundred.

36
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,090
It means that the ball is right here.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,280
Right.

38
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,450
So we are going to say canvas element art with, keep in mind, divided by two.

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,660
If this is true, then the it is going to be player paddle.

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,550
R.I, if it is not true, it is going to be player paddle I.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:50,630
OK, so right after this, what I want to do is I want to go ahead and I want to create that mouse move

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,400
as well.

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,790
So I'm going to come right here and I'm going to see I'm going to say the player Padel r.i event listener,

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,190
event listener.

45
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,760
This is going to be a simple event, the player panel, and we are going to grab our canvas element.

46
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,190
Why do we want this event to be attached to the canvas is because whenever the user goes off the canvas,

47
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,730
the user should not be able to move that paddle by the user I mean the r.i so out of the center.

48
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:28,690
What is the event mouse move and the move paddle function should fire.

49
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,910
We are going to create that function and I'm going to pass in the event and I'm going to say let canvas

50
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,330
erect a canvas rect right.

51
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:49,820
Should be equal to the canvas is now the canvas rect is going to store inside of it all the boundaries

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,110
of the canvas itself.

53
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:58,070
And for that we are going to use a very handy method and that is called get bounding client direct and

54
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,580
thus get bound and close ranks is going to give us the height the with the X position, the Y position,

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,180
all of it.

56
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:13,530
For that canvas and then we are going to say, Padel, sorry, player, paddle player, paddle.

57
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,610
Ah, I dot the Y position of that because we are just moving the paddle in the Y position and we are

58
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:29,540
basically concerned with that now before doing that, I just have to go ahead and show it to you.

59
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm just going to say cancel the log so you can really see what I'm talking about, can restrict its

60
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,270
function.

61
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,560
What is the name of the function.

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,610
Move, paddle.

63
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,520
Perfect.

64
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,850
So if I come to inspect.

65
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:57,400
If I bring the inspector right here, I go to the so you can see that if I if I just clear that and

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,450
if I move inside the canvas, you can see that this event is being fair.

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,050
Now, let's take a look at inside one of these events.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,300
So we have bottom.

69
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,270
We have to hide.

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,480
We have left, we are right.

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,110
We have TARP.

72
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,380
We have with we have X and we have Y now from all of this, what it is that we want to grab.

73
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,240
OK, so let's open this once more and.

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,600
We want to grab this why or also call the client why we can grow, so if I.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,690
There should be a lot more in here.

76
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,490
So let's go into Proteau.

77
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,390
There we go.

78
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,540
Constructor.

79
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,680
That's everything that we have there, Read-Only.

80
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,120
OK, well, basically, what I want to graph from this is going to be the client, why so I'm going

81
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,610
to say darte client.

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,990
Client Y.

83
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,730
Let's see what it is going to give us.

84
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,440
So I'm going to give I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab the event itself and let's see what

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,850
that event is going to give us.

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,490
OK.

87
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,300
OK, so this is the event.

88
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,990
And then we go inside this event, we are going to grab that.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,870
Right.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,310
So basically, I want to grab the client y of the event.

91
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,720
Where is the client?

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,340
Why this is the client y right.

93
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,820
So I'm going to come inside the code and I'm going to say.

94
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:34,900
Let that player, panel player panel are I the y position of that should be determined by the events

95
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,600
client.

96
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:43,560
Why so let's say client Y minus the offset that we have, what is the offset that we have?

97
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,860
That is the canvasses.

98
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,930
You saw that canvas top and we are also subtract from it.

99
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,580
The player paddles height divided by two and it is going to give us the top 50 percent.

100
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,290
So basically what we are going to do is we are interested in grabbing this player's height from the

101
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,980
top because there are only three scenarios here.

102
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,150
One is going to be directly in the middle of this panel right here.

103
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,070
The other one is going to be the top.

104
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,470
The other one is going to be the ball.

105
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,840
So in the middle, the Y is going to be zero.

106
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,990
And the top the Y is going to be 50 and the bottom, the Y is going to be negative 50.

107
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,410
Why do we need all this?

108
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,680
Because we are going to use the we're going to use design cosine tangent to determine the angle of the

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,400
ball to about the angle at which the ball bounces off.

110
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,830
That's why we need to borrow.

111
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,650
That's why what I'm going to do is I'm basically I'm getting either a fifty, which means it's the top

112
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,750
or a negative fifty eight, which means the bottom.

113
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:52,990
So player paddle, ah, I don't hide, that's why we divide it by the height, by the height divided

114
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,380
by two, so we either get 50 or negative 50.

115
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,080
OK, so this is done as well.

116
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,780
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to come down to our everything manager function.

117
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,000
And the next thing that I want to do is I'm going to come on top and I'm going to create our.

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,220
So I'm going to say creating the A.I. is going to be very, very simple.

119
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,910
The first thing that I want to create is going to be the intelligence level.

120
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,680
So intelligence level and I'm going to set it to zero point one and the maximum is one.

121
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,600
And I'm going to grab the player panel A.I. dot y position.

122
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,659
So what is the Y position for that?

123
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm going to add on to it.

124
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:44,070
All right, I'm going to add on to it an algorithm that I'm just going to be writing here, so we are

125
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,980
going to say that if the ball's y position.

126
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:55,680
It's the boss y position minus the player part and the player padel idot y position.

127
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,590
So let's say that Webbs plus the high divided by two.

128
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,330
It's exactly the same thing that we did for here.

129
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,130
So the top position, the position of this, the vertical position of the the ah, I was the client

130
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:17,540
where it was moving in which minus the top position from there, minus the minus half of its height

131
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,670
working, going to do the same thing for that because we want to get a negative 50 and a 50 for that.

132
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:30,150
So player apparel, I dot height divided by two.

133
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,270
All right, now to be able to use our intelligence level, I'm just going to multiply it by that.

134
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:45,980
So in this case, this I will not be able to center its padel completely to head the ball to for the

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,830
ball to hit it in the center.

136
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,290
If it if we just remove this zero point one, if you remove the intelligence level, the I will always

137
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:03,350
be able to center the ball at its panels center and then it is always going to headed there and it's

138
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,520
never going to miss.

139
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,740
Right.

140
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,510
And that's exactly what we want to do as well.

141
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:08,970
Right.

142
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,240
We want the ball to have the paddle directly in the center.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,080
What if it doesn't headed directly in the center?

144
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,860
What about then?

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,210
That's when our collision detection pattern detector data is going to come in.

146
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,730
So.

147
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm going to say f now here is where the all of the interesting things happen, so f the if the paddle

148
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:42,030
paddle kuli ditty, let's passan or two of the arguments, one is going to be the player.

149
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,830
So in here we had the ball and the paddle and the reason that I pass and the player is because we have

150
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,230
specified a right here and the player is going to have a specific paddle.

151
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,510
Either that paddle is going to belong to the EHI or to the to the player or to the ah player.

152
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,250
Now if it hits it, we are going to play the audio.

153
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,840
Right.

154
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,390
That's that's done.

155
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,080
So first off, let's find out what is the point at which that it has hidden.

156
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,240
So that is I'm going to call it the collision.

157
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,590
OK, I'm going to call it the collision point now, the collision point, because we want to make sure

158
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,300
that it hits the center of the ball, heads the center of the paddle.

159
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,360
What is the center of the ball?

160
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,710
The center of the ball is going to be exactly the Y position or the exposition.

161
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:41,700
Why we are not using the X position because the paddles are vertical and they're moving in a vertical

162
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,230
direction.

163
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,730
We are just interested in the vertical position.

164
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,970
So we are going to say the ball's vertical position is going to give us that center of the ball.

165
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,710
So there we go.

166
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,640
You can see that this is moving and this is moving as well.

167
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,010
So if I reload, the ball is going to go away.

168
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,050
Let me keep this ball so it doesn't go off this.

169
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,900
It doesn't go off the screen.

170
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,340
There we go.

171
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,360
So this is the center of the ball, we have talked about this, I think before, that whenever you provide

172
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,260
a starting angle, the starting angle is going to start from here.

173
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,990
And we only provide coordinates for a circle.

174
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,800
The coordinates are going to be directly in the center of that circle as opposed to a rectangle where

175
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,020
when you provide a rectangle with coordinates, the coordinates are going to be at the top left corner.

176
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,240
And from there the rectangle is going to be drawn all the way to bottom right corner.

177
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,620
But for the circles, it's different.

178
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,100
The coordinate is in the middle.

179
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,270
So if I say ball that Y position, it is going to give me the center of the ball.

180
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,620
I want to grab the center of the ball.

181
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:55,790
And from this, let me just come in this one back in and from the center of the ball, I want to subtract

182
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:02,890
the Y position of the player so we get that 50 percent or that 50 pixels.

183
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,980
So the player y the player could be any player.

184
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,480
Right.

185
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,380
So I'm just going to you know what?

186
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:19,490
I'm just going to come in this one out so it is clear when the ball hits the paddle of any player.

187
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,360
Right.

188
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:29,250
Plus, the players height player, that height divided by two, save it.

189
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,830
So this is going to be a this is going to give us our collision point now.

190
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,230
This is the time to go to our Mathis's fun website.

191
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,300
So here it is.

192
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,450
Here we have our sine cosine and tangent.

193
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,230
We are basically interested in design and cosine.

194
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:55,650
So the sign of any angle is going to be the opposite side of that triangle divided by the hypotenuse.

195
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,530
The cosine of the angle is going to be the adjacent divided by a hypotenuse.

196
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,220
We know the angle, this theta angle.

197
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,240
We know that that's 45 degrees.

198
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,950
That's something that we have determined in our sole discretion.

199
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,760
You can determine that as ten degrees.

200
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:23,280
For example, if I were to the, let's say, open this game and zoom out and if I had it, you can see

201
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
that was 45 degrees.

202
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,570
So it's totally up to you.

203
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,290
You want to specify 45 degrees.

204
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,940
There we go.

205
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,290
Or do you want to specify 10 degrees, 100 degrees?

206
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,410
That's completely up to you.

207
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,850
There we go.

208
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,170
Another 45 degrees.

209
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,900
I want it to be 45 degrees.

210
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,390
So this theta is going to be 45 degrees.

211
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,660
And I want to find out how the ball is going to move diagonally.

212
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,810
I know how the ball is going to move towards the top.

213
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,240
That is the Y velocity.

214
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,760
I know how the ball is going to move to to one side or the other side.

215
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,480
That is the X velocity.

216
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,940
How is the ball going to move diagonally?

217
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,540
That's what we have to find out.

218
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:13,830
So if the ball is moving in this way, we are going to get we are going to get because it is moving

219
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,400
in this way.

220
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,170
We are going to get a negative angle.

221
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,750
And when it is moving in this way, we are going to get a positive angle because towards the bottom,

222
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,850
we always know that this is positive.

223
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,160
Towards the top it is negative.

224
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:26,940
Right.

225
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,010
So this is what we are going to do.

226
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,550
So.

227
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,330
The reason that in here, what I'm willing to do is I'm going to say normalization, normalization.

228
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,330
The reason that I'm doing normalization is to convert converting negative 50 that we have.

229
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,660
And 50 to what?

230
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,990
To negative one and one.

231
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,090
How can I do that?

232
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,660
How can I normalize that?

233
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:02,720
Because for sine and cosine to calculate the distance for us or the angle.

234
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:03,870
All right.

235
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:12,300
For them to calculate that they can calculate better if we pass in like I know we are going to pass

236
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:19,110
in 45 degrees, but they're going to return the 45 degrees, not in 50 or minus 50.

237
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,000
They're going to return it closer to one or closer to negative one or closer to zero.

238
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,660
So sine and cosine can only output one negative one or zero or in range or in this range.

239
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,770
So from zero to either one or from zero to either negative one, that's what sine unchosen do.

240
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,100
That's why you should convert them to negative one and one.

241
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:52,780
So I'm going to grab my collision point and I'm going to say the collision point should be divided by

242
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,940
the player's height.

243
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,050
We know the players height divided by two is going to be 50, the complete player.

244
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,150
So let me just write it so it's easier for you to understand.

245
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,530
Player Dotti divided by two players, height is 100, divided by two.

246
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,250
We get 50.

247
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,410
Collision point is either minus 50 or 50 or zero.

248
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,369
If it is minus 50, minus 50, divided by 50.

249
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,619
We are going to get what negative one.

250
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,940
If collision point is 50/50 divided by 50, we get one.

251
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,550
And what is the third thing that sine and cosine output that's zero.

252
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,870
If collision point is zero, we divided by 50 zero divided by 50, we are going to get zero.

253
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,390
So we are going to get our zero as well.

254
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,140
So this is what we need for science and closer.

255
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,810
So what are we going to do as I'm going to specify our bounce angle as well?

256
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,050
So I'm going to say calculating this is where you can manipulate the bounce angle.

257
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,300
You can change it to 30 degrees to 50 to 70.

258
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,990
That's up to you.

259
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,280
Calculating the angle at which.

260
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,850
The ball bounces back.

261
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:14,840
And the unit is going to be Irradiance Arad Radiance, so I'm going to say let bounds angle.

262
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:22,820
So what is that it is going to be math dot pi divided by four.

263
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,630
Why?

264
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:31,180
Because math that PI is going to return 180 degrees hundred and divided by four, we get 45 degrees.

265
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,610
Now, what is the direction of this?

266
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,680
Forty five degrees.

267
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,090
That's where the collision point comes in.

268
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,400
So collision point multiply by that.

269
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,620
So if the collision point is negative one, this balance angle is going to have is going to be negative

270
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,020
45 degrees and it is going to travel.

271
00:18:52,060 --> 00:19:01,630
From here to the top right direction to this direction, that's negative 45, if the bounce of the collision

272
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:08,950
point is one, it is going to this bounce angle is going to be 45 and 45 is going to travel in this

273
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,400
direction.

274
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:17,190
If the collision point, this is the cool part, if the collision point is zero, the bounce angle is

275
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,970
going to be zero and the ball is going to travel in a straight line.

276
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,440
This is where it where we tie up every loose end.

277
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:32,370
So now, because we have selected everything, we need to update our velocity.

278
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:44,580
So I'm going to say updating the velocity now when I'm going to say when the ball hits any part of.

279
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:55,420
So we are going to grab the balls X velocity first and we are going to say there is one more variable

280
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,060
that we need to create here, but I have to first update it and then create that variable.

281
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,850
And so what is the we are going to grab the ball speed.

282
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,350
Of course we need that.

283
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,310
We are going to multiply it and we are going to say now what do we want to get?

284
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,160
We want to get this.

285
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:19,480
See, so when we provided forty five degrees, how the ball is going to travel, what is what is the

286
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,950
tilt that the ball is going to travel by.

287
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,390
So we need the hypotenuse for hypotenuse.

288
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,210
We know if the ball is traveling in this way, that is the Y velocity.

289
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,260
If the ball is moving in this way that is adjacent, that is the X velocity.

290
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,130
But what if the ball is moving in a combination of opposite and adjacent velocities?

291
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,290
How can we find this hypotenuse?

292
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:52,860
We just say if we want to find out the X direction or the Y direction for the hypotenuse.

293
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,780
Now, actually, we have found out the hypotenuse.

294
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,430
We know that the the ball is going to move in the 45 degrees.

295
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,840
But when the ball is moving 45 degrees, how much is it moving in the direction and how much is it moving

296
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,760
in the right direction?

297
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,660
That's why we need to find out these two, not the hypotenuse, but this time, I'm sorry for that.

298
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,480
I just because it's been twenty one minutes and I'm getting a little bit tired and I hope you don't

299
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,800
mind.

300
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:28,780
So when the ball is moving diagonally, how far it is moving in the Y direction, how far it is moving

301
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,700
in the direction.

302
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:38,020
So if I multiply hypotenuse by side of that angle we are going to get how much the ball is moving in

303
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,950
the right direction.

304
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,520
And if I multiply hypotenuse by the cosine of that angle, we are going to get how much the ball is

305
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,190
moving in the direction.

306
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,420
So first things first, let's get the X..

307
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,980
So where are we?

308
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,990
We are right here.

309
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:58,390
So we are going to say math dot for the X we have cosine.

310
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,910
So we are going to say cosine and I'm going to pass.

311
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:07,870
And the bounce angle, the best angle is going to be either forty five negative forty five or zero.

312
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Right now we do have this, but we need to find out the direction this is going to give us how far the

313
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,690
ball is moving along the x axis.

314
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,120
And if I do this.

315
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:30,070
This is why and instead of cosign, I'm going to put inside, this is going to say how far the ball

316
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:37,330
is moving along the Y direction along the Y axis, but what is the direction it is along the Y axis

317
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,290
or but is it moving upward or is it moving done what?

318
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,210
We need to find that out as well.

319
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,740
So my computer is really working hard.

320
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,730
I'm just going to close that one and there is only one going to be open.

321
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:55,570
And for that I'm going to say calculating the direction.

322
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,680
The direction at which.

323
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,990
Which the ball bounces.

324
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:15,120
Back of the boat, not it's not that it's the one calculating the direction of the ball.

325
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:24,950
The direction of the ball when it bounces back, bounces back, what is the direction?

326
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:32,430
So when the ball hits this paddle and the angle is not zero, it means that it's not moving in a straight

327
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:32,800
line.

328
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,420
We know it's moving at 45 degrees, but it went which direction we need to assign that negative forty

329
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,090
five degrees to something.

330
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,990
So we want to assign that negative in 45 degrees to top and positive 45 degrees to bottom.

331
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,830
So for that, I'm going to say let direction this is our point.

332
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:02,010
Our Situation Room say if the ball's exposition is less than the canvas element, canvas elements with

333
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,090
divided by two, if this if this is true.

334
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:16,940
It means that the ball is in the endzone at the players, it could be at each side's player, it doesn't

335
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:23,420
really matter, but we want the ball to move in a positive direction and otherwise we want it to move

336
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,490
in a negative direction.

337
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,340
And I'm going to grab that direction and I'm going to multiply this by that direction as well.

338
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,510
So I'm going to multiply by the direction and want to say multiply by the direction.

339
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,000
So let's put it there as well.

340
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:45,710
And finally, when after each time the ball, I'm going to say after each bounce back, each bounce

341
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,330
back, what do we want to do?

342
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,720
We want to increase the speed of the ball.

343
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,640
The speed of the ball should be increased.

344
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:04,490
So we are going to grab the ball that speed and we are going to add onto it now how much you want it

345
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,270
to increase.

346
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,070
That's up to you.

347
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,410
I'm just going to go ahead and increase it by zero point one.

348
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,290
And now let's see so the ball bounces back.

349
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:12,890
There we go.

350
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,930
So let's see if it bounces back from here.

351
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,270
There we go.

352
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,990
You can see when it hits it right at the top, it goes directly at forty five degrees.

353
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,870
And there we go at the bottom directly.

354
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,860
Forty five degrees.

355
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,100
If I tried to hit it in the middle it should go in a straight line.

356
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,050
So let's see.

357
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,760
There we go.

358
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,820
There you can see almost in a straight line.

359
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:49,880
So I'm going to try to make that no, it wasn't so the angle is going to range from zero to 45 C almost

360
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,810
in a straight line.

361
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,640
When it hits it in the middle, it goes almost in a straight line.

362
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,840
And when it hits it towards the bottom, it is going to come to the bottom.

363
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,860
When it heads towards the top, it is going to go to the top.

364
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,970
So so so far, we have been able to create all this.

365
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,050
And let's add our sounds so we should get our sense.

366
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,020
All right.

367
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,410
If I had it perfect, perfect, and now I'm going to let the computer score so we can hear that sound

368
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:24,850
as well.

369
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,540
OK, we did not hear that we are going to fix that, don't worry, and you can see that now we cannot

370
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,200
see the ball.

371
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,260
Where is the ball?

372
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,170
We did not reset the ball.

373
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,420
That's what we are going to do in our next lecture.

374
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,560
See you guys then.
