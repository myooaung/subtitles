00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,710
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,460
In this lecture, we will determine the winner.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:14,870
All right, so we have created the now for each of the boxes we need to provide a an event listener,

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,620
the event is going to listen for a click because basically we are clicking inside these boxes.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,810
All right.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,580
So I'm going to grab the box and I'm going to add event listener.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,780
The event is going to be click whenever the user clicks, we are going to grab a function and call that

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,730
function box collect.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Now, the rest of the game is going to be fairly simple, so I will just go ahead and breeze through

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,490
it.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,640
So we have our box clicked and I'm going to put in the E!

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,990
Now all of our boxes, they have Idiz zero one to all the way to eight.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,820
We can leverage that.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,120
So first off, let's go ahead and store it inside a variable so we can reuse it.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,260
We are going to say a target.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,980
That idea is going to give us the idea for that specific element.

17
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:12,380
And we are going to say if the ID if the if it is not, the space is.

18
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,300
Out of the box IED.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,790
All right, so because we have like nine spaces, and if the IED for the box, IED for that space is

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,540
that we have or actually we do have choices here, because in my original thing, I created spaces that

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,640
Sweitzer spaces.

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,840
If this is not true, it means that the IED doesn't belong to this.

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,830
What do we want to do?

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,780
We want to grab our choices.

25
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,520
And the backside.

26
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,870
The box eyed and we want to set it to the player, Mr..

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,420
So each time it is not true, it is going to be the next player's turn right.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,960
And what do we want to do exactly at that moment?

29
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:10,850
We want to grab the entire text because whenever we click, we are actually changing the entire text.

30
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,010
So inner text should be whichever player it is that is blank.

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,610
So I'm just going to set it to players turn.

32
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,910
After that, we are going to switch the player.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,740
So we are going to say player's turn is going to be first.

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,270
We need to check if it is the player one turn because that's what we did above.

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,920
So if players turn equals player one.

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:48,130
PLAYER one Then we want to switch it to players, too, otherwise we want to keep it at player one right

37
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,120
now in here.

38
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,090
What I would love to do is I want to do and if statement and we are going to create this function,

39
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,300
that is going to be player one, not play one.

40
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,170
Player one.

41
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,860
And we are going to pass on the players turn now, whichever player wins and this statement becomes

42
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,310
true, what do we want to do that we want to grab our result, which is that I want and we want to change

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,450
the entire text.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,320
All right, what do we want to change it to?

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:26,510
So let's open our tactics and we want to change it to the players turn so the players turn is going

46
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,020
to either say oh or X, and then we just want to say wins.

47
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,590
So either O wins or X wins.

48
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:44,030
And then because the board is going to be reset it automatically, we are going to do after one second.

49
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,920
I'm just going to increase it to maybe like one point five seconds.

50
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:56,690
We are going to call a function that is going to be reset board and it is going to be called after 1500

51
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,510
milliseconds.

52
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Now, first off, let's go ahead and let's create the player player once a function, play your player

53
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,340
want.

54
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,460
Now, this function is going to be fairly straightforward.

55
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,050
We are just going to hard code all the possibilities in which a player can win.

56
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:24,350
So the first possibility is whenever you either put three in a row, like in the first row or in the

57
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,040
first column, first off, I'm going to do that.

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,430
So what is the so we are going to grab this.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,240
So this is going to be our pivot.

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:41,600
So from this pivot, if I have two in the row in a row or if I have two in a column which match, whichever

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,480
it is, whatever it is inside this pivot, it means that this player has won.

62
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,140
So let's go ahead and let's implement if statements for that.

63
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:59,320
So we are going to say f the choices, we are going to grab the zero index.

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,120
That's the first pivot that we are talking about.

65
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,700
Let's grab our player.

66
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,420
Now, if if it is the first index, we only have two possibilities.

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,330
I'm ignoring diagonal because we are going to handle it later.

68
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,700
So for this, we just have row in column.

69
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,320
So we are going to say that.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,140
And if the choice is now, first off, let's grab the row.

71
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,840
So what is the index of this?

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,820
It is what what is the index of this?

73
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,470
It is too.

74
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:37,610
So we are going to say if this equals this or the index of one equals the index of two choices.

75
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,390
One equals the player that we have.

76
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,900
So the player is going to be displayed that we passed in there and choices.

77
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,330
So what was the other index?

78
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,510
That was two, if that is also equal to the player, what it is that we want and say we want to return.

79
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,870
True.

80
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,210
Right.

81
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,100
So this is going to take care of that.

82
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm just going to also say council log when.

83
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:21,140
All right, I'm going to say pivot, pivot, one when one, I'm just going to say one pivot one, one,

84
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,270
right.

85
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,490
That's open up the console in here.

86
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,250
There we go.

87
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,420
So if I put one here and if I put one, that was the Anex, OK, so I'm just going to reload the page.

88
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,990
One here, one here, one here, one here and one there.

89
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,480
And you can say it says that player one, of course, the reset board is not created yet.

90
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,630
So in order to just avoid that, we are going to say just commented out.

91
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,850
Now, this is when the choices is zero.

92
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,610
Keep this in mind.

93
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,890
It means that we are using this.

94
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,450
So we have handled the let's go ahead and let's handle the column.

95
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,080
So for the column, what do we have?

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,090
What are the indices?

97
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,780
So the index is three.

98
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,800
So zero one, two, three, four or five and six.

99
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,290
So three and six.

100
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,140
Now, if the choice says I'm just going to copy this just to save you some time because the ideology

101
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,720
is the same.

102
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,430
So three and six, we are going to return the same thing.

103
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,700
So let's just put it right here.

104
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,290
Pivot one point one, pivot one, point two.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,890
So now let's create that pivot one point two.

106
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,460
There we go.

107
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,150
So we were able to do logic for that.

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,320
I'm just going to put in pivot.

109
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,390
I hope it makes sense.

110
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,460
This word pivot, if it doesn't make sure to change it with anything that makes sense to you.

111
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,240
Now, the next thing that I would like to do, I would like to travel diagonally to this side and I'm

112
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,170
going to provide

113
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm going to provide one for whenever we go up and whenever we go left.

114
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,990
Right.

115
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:19,240
So let's go into our coat and we're going to grab what is the index of the what is the index of that?

116
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,880
The Spivet, the index of this Privett is the last index, which is index number eight.

117
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,780
Right.

118
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,280
So let's grab that.

119
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,170
And for that, we could just go ahead and copy this.

120
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,510
So I'm going to say pivot one and I am just going to put it here and I'm going to say pivot to.

121
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,159
So the index is eight.

122
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,900
We want to say that whenever five and two are equal.

123
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,530
So let's just put it to five.

124
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,310
That is two.

125
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,560
We are going to say pivot two point one.

126
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:59,230
And whenever it is seven and six, so it's going to be seven in six, we are going to say pivot two

127
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,110
point to perfect.

128
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,160
So let's go ahead and test it.

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,470
There we go, pivot two point one, reload the page

130
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,920
and also pivot to point to and we are done with that as well.

131
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,860
So this was pivot to and we will have only one other pivot.

132
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,580
And within that, we are going to handle diagonal movements.

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,360
So the pivot is actually going to be the center point that we have.

134
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,760
So let's copy that, put it here.

135
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:39,540
Let's change it to pivot three, right, and now what is the index of this?

136
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,520
The index is going to be force.

137
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,190
I'm just going to put it for now for this.

138
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,260
We are going to have four different conditions.

139
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,230
Right.

140
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,450
So this is not only diagonally, but also in these ways.

141
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,630
So first off, if it is, I'm just going to put one here.

142
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,700
If it is horizontal, the second one is if it is vertical from top to bottom.

143
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,500
This one.

144
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,870
This one and this one.

145
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:11,730
The third one is going from either from this diagonal diagonal to there or going diagonally to here.

146
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,540
Right.

147
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:20,070
So whenever you put it from in this direction, from left to right, keep in mind that right to left

148
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,050
is also covered.

149
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,870
So you don't have to provide if statements for those.

150
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,870
So it is for first off, we are going to get the horizontal.

151
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,320
So on one side of the four, we have three.

152
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,120
On the other side we have five.

153
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,960
So let's put in three and let's put in five.

154
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,610
Let's grab this three point one and three point two.

155
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,070
So on top we have one and we have seven.

156
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,740
So we have one and we have seven.

157
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,580
Perfect.

158
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm going to copy it two more times.

159
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,060
Four diagonal movements.

160
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,570
All right, so diagonally we have three, so this is going to be three and this is going to be six,

161
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,710
so let's pass them.

162
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:11,900
And so it's three and this six, we are going to say three point three and the other diagonal is going

163
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,370
to be zero and eight.

164
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:21,610
So this is going to be zero and this is going to be eight and we're going to pass in three point four.

165
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,120
So let's save this.

166
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,170
So it should work in all directions.

167
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,000
Perfect O wins, perfect to reload the page.

168
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,290
It should work in this direction as well.

169
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,570
So I'm going to do it like this.

170
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
And it didn't work, it must it should have worked.

171
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,280
And player one.

172
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,250
OK, so what did we do here?

173
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,570
Players turned and we said zero.

174
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:06,150
OK, so this is private to eight, and for the eight, we had five and two and we had seven and six.

175
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,650
Perfect.

176
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,890
So for the third private, what we had was whenever it is choices four, we have three.

177
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,260
Oh, this is not three.

178
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,760
So whenever one is three.

179
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,020
So let's take a look at it.

180
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,120
Three this on one side and the other side it is five.

181
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,720
Perfect.

182
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,380
So now this is this should be working and let's put in double equals and just going to click everywhere.

183
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,100
And I could, I could just grab both of the quality sides.

184
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:46,910
And we could just pass in another, uh, equality sign there and another here.

185
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,860
And why have we done to.

186
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,130
I have no idea, so let's just rectify these as well.

187
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,720
So we have one and seven, so it is ours one.

188
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,740
And so this is one.

189
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,730
And this is seven.

190
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,740
And this is three.

191
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
And this is five.

192
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,570
Perfect.

193
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,250
Then we have three and six.

194
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:22,570
I don't think this is correct, so this is diagonal, right, so diagonally, this is not three, this

195
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,340
is two and six.

196
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,410
So we made a mistake here.

197
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
Well, actually, I made a mistake.

198
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,300
And this is correct.

199
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,130
Zero and eight.

200
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,040
So let's save it.

201
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,250
Let's come here.

202
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,640
So let's check it diagonally first when it's perfect.

203
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,450
We are going to check it this way as well.

204
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:54,200
Wins perfect and let's check it top to bottom wins, check it sideways wins, and I think it should

205
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,970
win in all cases.

206
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,160
I mean, in this way, it wins perfect, so the only thing remaining for us is going to be handling

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,500
the reset button.

208
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,210
So let's go ahead and let's actually grab our reset button.

209
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,590
I'm not going to postpone it to another video.

210
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,250
We are just going to go ahead and added here.

211
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:22,460
All right, so we have our event listener and it is going to be Kleck and then we are going to call

212
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,100
a function that is going to be a reset board.

213
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,730
Right, that's commented in in here as well.

214
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,110
One point five seconds and let's create this function.

215
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,830
So it is going to be function reset board.

216
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,980
And we're going to grab our choices, they're going to set it to an empty array.

217
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,240
We are going to grab all of our boxes and we are going to say for each of them, we want to grab our

218
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,340
individual box and.

219
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,990
And that individual box is.

220
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:11,190
Inner text is going to be an empty and empty quote or an empty string, right?

221
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:19,410
And after that, we want to grab our result because whenever the game is reset it, instead of saying

222
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,210
who won, we want to change the results in a text to the tic tac toe.

223
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,770
So let's say tic tac toe.

224
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:39,090
Perfect, and finally, we want to change the current the players turn, so it's going to be a player's

225
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,640
turn.

226
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,030
It's going to be player one.

227
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,070
Perfect.

228
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,370
So let's save that and let's check it out here.

229
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,950
So.

230
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,400
There we go.

231
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,280
And after one point five seconds, it is going to go away and you can see it's this pivot.

232
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,980
One point to this should be pivot to point to point to the we.

233
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,530
And did it show who won?

234
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,150
Yep, went.

235
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,240
So now, uh hmm.

236
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,600
All right, so let's test it a few times, we can see that the player is there, the player is being

237
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,630
changed, and we actually we do not need to go ahead and hardcoded there.

238
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:30,740
And because each time the game is reset it, we want another player to actually play it.

239
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,200
So and now it is it has to be exis.

240
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,650
There we go.

241
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:44,170
So I think that's it and the only thing remaining here as just the restart button, which works fine,

242
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,250
you can just click restart it and just to restart the window.

243
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,410
So restart the board.

244
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,820
So you can see no one went there.

245
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,870
Yeah, except one.

246
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,840
So basically you can we started using this button as well.

247
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,850
That's it for this game and for this chapter.

248
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,410
See you guys in the next one.
