00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.010
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.550
In this lecture, we're going to reposition the stars if they go off either side of the screen.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.630
All right, now, first things first, let's go over the theory first so the implementation is easier.

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.360
So if I reload this page, you can see that because we have only specified the horizontal velocity,

5
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.890
we can see that our stores only work even only move even towards the right, either towards the right

6
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.670
or left.

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.560
There is no up and down movement.

8
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.430
That's something that we are going to do next.

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:44.330
But now what we are going to do is let's go over the theory so we can we know that this this if we move

10
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.000
from one side of the screen to the next side of the screen to the other side, this is horizontal movement.

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.300
Right.

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.820
And if we move to the right, it is positive numbers.

13
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.210
If we move to the left, it's negative.

14
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.760
So where does this positive and negative numbers they their origin.

15
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.620
So this right up the edge of the screen, right towards the edge, this is zero.

16
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.070
So right up up against this edge, it is X is zero.

17
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.620
So if something goes off the cat of the of the right, we know when it goes the off of the left side,

18
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.270
what happens.

19
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.530
But what about if it goes what what about if it goes off the right side.

20
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.860
We would say that it has gone above the value of the canvas.

21
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.140
Start with because in this case can we start with was how much was it?

22
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.650
Let me just bring it back.

23
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.170
So can we start with is in this case, just do that, bring it up a little.

24
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.730
Can we start with is 877.

25
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.580
So when it is eight seventy seven if something travels to 878.

26
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.730
Plus its radius, then we say that it has moved completely off the screen from the right, if it goes

27
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.220
zero below zero plus it's full with, we can say that it has moved off the left of the screen by its

28
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.780
full with.

29
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.310
Now, that is the eye.

30
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.040
That is the.

31
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.260
Theory behind it.

32
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.920
Now let's dive into the implementation, which is usually the trickier part.

33
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.150
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to come down here because we are still and I'm going to stay

34
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.710
within this loop.

35
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.390
I should stay within that.

36
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:48.200
And I'm going to say reposition stars if I'm not to the other to the other side of the screen.

37
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.900
If not, I'm not going to say it's not an if.

38
00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:04.080
It's a when when they move off either it's either side of the screen.

39
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.750
Right.

40
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.820
So so we need an if statement.

41
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.600
Why would we need an if statement.

42
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.630
Because we need to check whether they have gone off the left side of the screen or right side of the

43
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.030
screen.

44
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:25.920
So if if the stars if each of the stars horizontal position is less than zero.

45
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.030
All right, it means that they have gone where to the left of the screen, off the left of the screen,

46
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.130
and I said the radius don't don't forget the radius, because we want to make sure that they have gone

47
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.850
completely off, not like by one percent are.

48
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.030
For example, the radius is, let's say, 10 pixels.

49
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.480
Right.

50
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.460
If they have gone one pixel off the screen of the radius, we don't want them to be shown from the other

51
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.910
side.

52
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.970
When they go off completely, then we want to show them from the on the other side.

53
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.200
That's why we are going to use the radius as well, star radius.

54
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.680
So if this is the condition, it means that they have gone off the left side of the field, then what

55
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.310
do we want to do?

56
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.320
We want to grab the horizontal position.

57
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.980
They can see we just want to change that horizontal position.

58
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.050
What do we want to change it to?

59
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.490
What is canvas element that with what is it is from this all the way to here?

60
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.240
So that is the maximum with.

61
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.680
Right.

62
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.120
So we are going to grab canvas element art with now we need to add the radius as well.

63
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.440
So we need to account for the radius dot star radius.

64
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.040
Now, if I save this and if I come here, you can see that they go off this side and they appear on

65
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.440
this side.

66
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.070
It is the case that when they go off completely, then they appear completely.

67
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.070
That's the condition.

68
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.960
They should go off completely if they have gone up by 50 percent of their radius.

69
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.010
We don't want to show them.

70
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.710
It should go completely off that side.

71
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.030
Then we want to show them.

72
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.320
See, they come like like flooding in from the other side.

73
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.930
See now.

74
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.810
But the thing is, if they go from this side, we have not provided any statement for that.

75
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.490
They don't appear from this site.

76
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.760
So we are just going to say, hmm, and al-Assaf, let's do analysis, because it's within the same

77
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:38.110
if Stedman block, if the stars now keep this in mind, if they go off this side of the screen, it

78
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.060
means that canvas that with.

79
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.420
Is full, all right, plus, we need to account for the entire radius, so we are going to grab the

80
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.210
radius as well.

81
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:58.330
So if stars horizontal position, horizontal position is greater than the canvas element that height

82
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.230
greater, it means they're moved on the right side of the field.

83
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.040
Plus, let's grab the radius as well.

84
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.770
So Star's idot radius.

85
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.800
So we account for the full star itself, not half of it or one percent of it.

86
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.390
If this is the condition, what do we want to do?

87
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.630
Again, we want to grab our stars stars horizontal position and where do we want to put it?

88
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.950
We want to put it right here.

89
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.910
Whereas is here this is zero, right?

90
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.580
So I'm just going to say zero.

91
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.980
Now, where is the radius?

92
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.780
We need to provide the radius as well.

93
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.820
So that star radius.

94
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.330
Let's say it.

95
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.070
Come here, check it out.

96
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.540
So let's move it faster, faster.

97
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:56.280
It doesn't it doesn't show it, they move they move off this side, but they do not appear from this

98
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.530
side.

99
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.720
The other one worked.

100
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.050
Right.

101
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.270
So we can see that they appear from this side.

102
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.820
OK, so let's see what's happening here.

103
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:16.260
Canvas element that with so else, if we say that if stars horizontal position is greater than canvas

104
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.840
element, let's go to we don't have any errors in the console.

105
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.050
It should work.

106
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.320
I mean, technically, if there isn't any misspelled thing.

107
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:31.170
So al-Assaf stars horizontal position is greater than canvases.

108
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.550
With plus stars, I oh, here is the problem.

109
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.630
This should be stars radius.

110
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.070
Perfect, save it.

111
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.830
Let's come here.

112
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.260
So now they go off this side of the screen.

113
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.130
They do not appear still.

114
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.230
So is there something mistyped?

115
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.490
So it is it is the same thing that we have there, the same thing that we have there.

116
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.300
So.

117
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.060
Oh, its star is misspelled.

118
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.550
That's why it doesn't work stars.

119
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.220
So it works from that site.

120
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.860
And you can see it, they start appearing when they start disappearing from this side.

121
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.650
They started here.

122
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.480
It was just a question of like basic typo.

123
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.750
All right, let's remove this.

124
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.050
Come on, buddy, maybe he doesn't want to be closed.

125
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.280
It doesn't work, it's.

126
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:34.809
Close.

127
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:42.220
All right, so let's test it out, we can see that they started appearing, they start appearing from

128
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:48.610
this side, they go disappear to the right here from the left, disappeared to the left, appear from

129
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.030
the right.

130
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.670
Perfect.

131
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.870
Now, you might be asking, what about the uproar for this part and this part?

132
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.790
Now, I'm going to do that in this lecture as well.

133
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.720
I know it's been like 13 minutes, but you know what?

134
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.870
The concept is actually the same.

135
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.530
So I'm just going to copy that and I'm going to paste it down here.

136
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.290
We talked a lot about it.

137
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.610
So repositions stars to the two top.

138
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:26.030
To top slash bottom side of the screen when they move off, this is a typo here as well.

139
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:39.460
Etai mother move off either either from the top or or bottom.

140
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.220
I think this is grammatically correct.

141
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.380
So what we want to do here, we want to say so.

142
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.030
First off, let's change all these horizontal positions to vertical positions.

143
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:58.200
And we say that this is going to be the same and this canvas with is going to be extinguished.

144
00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.880
And I think that sets.

145
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.700
So let's save it.

146
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.940
So, oh, they do not go because we have not also set up the you remember.

147
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.230
Right.

148
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.570
We updated stars horizontal position.

149
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.890
We need to update these stars vertical position as well.

150
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:21.580
So the vertical position, I'm just going to copy both of them and I'm going to say vertical and the

151
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.760
vertical position is going to add on the vertical velocity times time difference times point zero one.

152
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.350
Save it.

153
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.350
Come here.

154
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.700
So now let's change it.

155
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.580
Reload the page, it should work.

156
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:35.900
I mean.

157
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.050
If there isn't, it doesn't mean we should have gotten something by now.

158
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.590
So where we are, so it's vertical position.

159
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.110
Vertical, is it?

160
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.090
Are there is a team missing verticle?

161
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:04.480
It's always these tapes now you can see there we go, so they go to top and they appear from the bottom.

162
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:13.020
Of course, diagonally and again the same direction, and they go to bottom diagonally and they appear

163
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.700
from the top.

164
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.000
So let's reload.

165
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.710
Let's check all the conditions.

166
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.850
Why do they only move in these two directions?

167
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.880
They should move to the right.

168
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.560
Let's come let's check this one out.

169
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:26.040
I mean.

170
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.740
So that's that was tough.

171
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.910
Let's get a left or right.

172
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.400
This is almost right, left, right.

173
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.850
You can see these they go to this side, so I mean, everything is working perfectly fine now.

174
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.360
There we go.

175
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.340
So you can see they appear to the left.

176
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:50.070
The ones that appear to the left are the ones that appear from the right and the ones that appear to

177
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.970
the top.

178
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.380
They appear from the bottom.

179
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.820
So it's working correctly.

180
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.830
And it's super slow, super slow.

181
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.620
All right, and.

182
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.100
It's a mixture of both of them, that's why they move diagonally.

183
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:08.980
It's a mixture.

184
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.670
I mean, let me check this one out.

185
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.620
Let's see.

186
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.160
Hmm.

187
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.930
Oh, there we got that.

188
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.820
It is random, so you need to refresh the page to get that now.

189
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.490
There we go.

190
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.330
We get this.

191
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.370
We got it, we got it.

192
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.050
Let's do this.

193
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.760
Let's get one for this one as well.

194
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:35.250
So come on, give me a sort of horizontal thing, sort of.

195
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.870
Come on, you can do it.

196
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.730
Or let's just check the code.

197
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:48.320
So if the vertical position it works, if the vertical position.

198
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:57.870
Is less than zero plus the stars radius, then we want to set the vertical position to the canvas is

199
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.790
Eigsti height.

200
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:07.440
All right, perfect canvas height and plus the stars star radius.

201
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.540
That part recarpet.

202
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:18.420
And if the stars vertical position is greater than the canvas is height we want plus these stars radius.

203
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:25.620
We want to reposition the the star is vertical position.

204
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.700
So if I highlighted.

205
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.090
Yes, it is highlighted.

206
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.710
That's correct.

207
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:36.030
Zero minus stars, stars, star radius.

208
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.800
I mean the concept is perfect.

209
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:45.910
And it's not even that that many lines of code, it's almost 90, so you should get that from.

210
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.080
For some reason, we are not getting it.

211
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.370
It's been 18 minutes.

212
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.100
Come on, buddy.

213
00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:02.210
Give me something, it's just either this diagonal, it doesn't move this, I mean, there is something

214
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.050
wrong with this.

215
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:12.350
I'm sure there is, because this one, it moves it moves from this diagonal, from this part as well.

216
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.780
I mean, there is something wrong with that.

217
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.190
So it moves in this case.

218
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.300
You can see that we don't have to switch so many times.

219
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.930
So it moves in this in this direction as well.

220
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.880
And, um.

221
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.510
Hmm.

222
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.020
All right.

223
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.460
I know it's been 18 minutes, but I have to find this thing.

224
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.140
It doesn't work.

225
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:37.040
It just works in two directions diagonally this way and diagonal this way.

226
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.090
It shouldn't do that.

227
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:45.530
All right, I'm pretty sure that it isn't misspell, I'm sure on that part, because otherwise, if

228
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.770
there were something else, we should see an error here.

229
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.510
I mean, if there were like a an assignment, a variable that doesn't exist or an assignment to the

230
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.630
considerable, we would have seen an error.

231
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.130
So when there is no error, it's most likely something a mistake.

232
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.780
So I'm going to go over this and we have our horizontal position.

233
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.090
You can see that they have been highlighted here.

234
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.390
And if I come on top, this is highlighted there as well.

235
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.750
So I'm going to highlight this vertical position.

236
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.470
It has been highlighted here and it has been highlighted here.

237
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.590
And the next thing that we have is I'm going to highlight our horizontal velocity.

238
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.830
There it is.

239
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.620
There it is.

240
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.490
And there it is.

241
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.780
And then I'm going to highlight a vertical velocity, which is here.

242
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.350
This is vertical velocity.

243
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.310
It's here and it's highlighted the horizontal one more time.

244
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.200
Here, here, here.

245
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:51.080
Why do we get more horizontal than vertical here, so we get do we do get one so?

246
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:58.030
So for vertical, I'm going to get this one and this one we don't get this one because we specified

247
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.910
it using this, so.

248
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:09.670
But it says vertical velocity, here is why why does it say horizontal, it should say vertical and

249
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.720
I think this is going to be the problem vertical.

250
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.390
So vertical velocity was actually equal to horizontal velocity.

251
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.570
And this is random sign.

252
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.170
All right.

253
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.810
So let's say let's come here and I can see that fixed.

254
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.810
And now you can see they come from the top.

255
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.550
They go that way diagonally.

256
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.990
They go this way.

257
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.210
Diagonally they go.

258
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:40.960
This they go this to the bottom left and there we go, we get it to one side, let's see if we can get

259
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.940
it to the other side.

260
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:50.360
Come on, come on, it's a lot of randomness, we don't get it slightly, the ones which appear from

261
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.410
here from the right are the ones which disappear to the left.

262
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.410
Come on.

263
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.270
Give me one.

264
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.270
Perfect like that one.

265
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.240
It's random, so it's really difficult to get that sometimes.

266
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.190
It's almost almost like that for these particles.

267
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.380
So let's see if we get now.

268
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.050
This is good.

269
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.349
See if we get it on this side.

270
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.280
This is the thing.

271
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:22.359
Oh, we got it in the previous one anyways, that's it for this like for this lecture and this chapter

272
00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.380
and this project.

273
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.420
That's it.

274
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.109
We are done.

275
00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.349
And I'm sorry for this one.

276
00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.980
It was just this is the problem when you copy paste something.

277
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:37.270
And I think we are done here and we did we covered a lot of cool ideas which which are going to help

278
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.440
us a lot when we want to create our games.

279
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:41.450
So that's it.

280
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.210
See you guys in the next project.
