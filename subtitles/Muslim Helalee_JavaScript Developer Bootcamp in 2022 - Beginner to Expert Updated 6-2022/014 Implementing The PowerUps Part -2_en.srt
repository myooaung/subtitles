1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,320
Hi, everyone, welcome to the second part of implementing our power cuts.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:13,330
All right, so first off, what we need to do as we we have created the power ups, they are coming

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,980
down, we need to collect them.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,770
So in order to collect them, we are going to go into our update padel function right here.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,300
And this function function, what we're going to do is a.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,070
So this is the wall collision for the panel.

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:42,400
Right underneath this, I'm going to say collect collecting, collecting the pups.

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,420
All right, so what we need now, we are going to loop over backward because we collect them and when

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,380
we collect them, we are going to delete them.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,970
That's why we are going to loop over it backwards.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,270
So we are going to say for I is equal to the pups length.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,209
It should start at that point and length minus one, of course.

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:13,360
And the eye is going to go is going to be equal or greater than zero and each time are going to decrement

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,370
the eye by one.

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,340
Perfect.

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,490
Now if now we need to provide some conditions.

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:27,120
So this these conditions are actually collision detection of the part of the pop and the paddle.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,740
So we are going to see if the pups I am just going to say I'm going to copy this because we are going

19
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,580
to have a lot of that.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:48,880
If the pups exposition plus the pups with half of the pups with is greater than the paddles exposition,

21
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,350
minus half of the paddles with the W time, zero point five, if it is greater than that.

22
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:03,940
And we are going to say and the pups exposition.

23
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:15,160
So X minus the pups, minus the pups with half of the pups with is less than the paddles.

24
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,540
Exposition plus the paddles, half of the paddles with so zero point five, let's save this.

25
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,400
Oh, it didn't rearrange it.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,350
I thought it would.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,710
So let's save this.

28
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,000
It doesn't rearrange it.

29
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,830
So let's add the other one.

30
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,080
I'm just going to hit enter there.

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,580
So we have said that if the Pops exposition plus half of the width is greater than the panel six position,

32
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:51,660
minus half of it's with and then the exposition minus the pops half of the pops width is less than the

33
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,930
paddles exposition plus the paddles with a right.

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,670
So what is the third condition now we have checked for the X positions.

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,490
We need to check in for Y positions as well.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,440
So I'm going to pass in our pops that if the Y position of the pop plus half of its off of its height,

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,180
not with this time.

38
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:26,490
If that is greater than the paddles y position paddleboat y minus half of the paddles height the tight

39
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,720
time, zero point five.

40
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:35,970
And finally we are going to check for our final condition, and that is if the pups y position minus

41
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:43,890
the pups height times minus half of the pups height, if that is less than the paddles.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:52,160
Why position plus half of the paddles hide, so paddle Dotti times zero point five, if all of that

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,870
is true, what do we want to do?

44
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,640
It means that's a collision has occurred and this is prettier.

45
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,500
All right.

46
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
So I'm going to go over this one more time.

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:08,470
So X half of that is greater than the paddles with and then smaller.

48
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:08,810
Right.

49
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,730
So we should be good.

50
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,720
We should be good.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,370
So what do we want to do here?

52
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:20,720
We are going to create a we are going to check for whichever type it is that has been passed because

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,480
whichever type it is, that is going to specify for us what we should do with the paddle.

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,470
If that is the extension type, we want the paddle to get bigger.

55
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,570
If that is the sticky, we want the paddle to the ball to stick to the paddle.

56
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,060
If it is life, we want increase the life.

57
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,770
So we have to check for whichever time it is that that has just that has just been devoured by the paddle.

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,500
So I'm going to do switch.

59
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:56,300
Switch and and here we are going to grab our pups, right, and we are going to grow from there the

60
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,410
type, so now we are going to create cases.

61
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,940
So the first case is going to be case.

62
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,720
Puppy type is extension.

63
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,540
So let's parcelling if it is extension.

64
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:21,210
If it is extension, we want to double double the the width of the panel, the width of the paddle.

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,070
How do we do that?

66
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:30,890
So first off, we need to check that if it is true, it means that it has already been consumed by the

67
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:38,810
paddle, then we do not want to double it, because each time if the user, like, grabs an extension

68
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,750
and doubles the width, then we are going to end up eventually with the kind of with that is going to

69
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,890
grab all of the screen.

70
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,230
And that is going to be a bug.

71
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,360
We don't want to do that.

72
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,310
So if.

73
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,880
If the user has already gotten a pop extension, if the extension is true, we just want to grab our

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:07,190
score and add onto it the pop bonus that I showed you otherwise, which is alse, what do we want to

75
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,420
do?

76
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,770
We want to grab our public's attention.

77
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,800
Otherwise, it means that public attention is false.

78
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,040
If it is false, we want to make it to true.

79
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,910
We want to set it to true.

80
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:29,630
And let's grab the paddles with and we are going to multiply on it to perfect and then we are going

81
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,940
to break from this.

82
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,050
So this is going to be our very first condition, our very first case.

83
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,240
We need four of these bad boys.

84
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,910
So this is case.

85
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm just going to provide some space, provide some space.

86
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:51,080
Be very careful when you are like copy pasting like this, because a lot of errors may arise from this

87
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,960
if you're not careful.

88
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,670
So the second one is going to be pop life.

89
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,680
If it is pop life, we want to add at a life.

90
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,720
But first, if the user has already gotten a pop life, well, we don't really are.

91
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,500
We are not going to check for that here.

92
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:17,690
We are basically going to grab our lives because if the user has gotten a life before or not, we are

93
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,420
basically just going to go ahead and increase the life.

94
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,810
It could go to 100 even there are only three.

95
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,780
That's what we that's what I would like to do.

96
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:34,130
You could go ahead and implement this situation and you could say that you can't you will increase the

97
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,340
life only by one in each level.

98
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,340
If you do this, then that is going to do it only because in each level, if you, for example, get

99
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,670
three lives, only the first one will increase the count.

100
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,400
The second two on the second to this condition is going to apply and they are just going to increase

101
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,930
the score to buy to 100 and buy 50 each time.

102
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,990
But each time the user grabs a life, I just want to increase the life for the next step.

103
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,350
We have pop sticky and this is going to make the paddle sticky.

104
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,040
So make the paddle sticky.

105
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:22,790
And we say that if pup pup sticky is true, we just want to add to the score or else if it is not true,

106
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,590
we want to grab our pup sticky and we want to set it to true.

107
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,820
Right.

108
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,500
And that's it.

109
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,179
That's what we want to do here.

110
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,390
We just want to set it to true.

111
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:42,549
We are going to handle that stickiness as well, but later and finally, we have our Super Bowl, this

112
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,490
is going to be pop super and I'm going to call it Super Shutz.

113
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,650
Super shots, right, if pop super, if pop super.

114
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,780
If it is pop, if pop superstar is are ready, we just want to increase the count score count by 50,

115
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,290
you can increase it to 100 or ten, whichever you like.

116
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:19,470
Otherwise, we are going to grab our I'm just going to remove this because we are not going to need

117
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,490
that, otherwise we are going to grab our super.

118
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,400
And said it true, and then we are going to break out of that as well.

119
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,920
So this is where our

120
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,090
our switch is going to end.

121
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,630
So.

122
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:44,630
There we go, it ends there and then I'm going to grab our pops and I'm going to splice the I want one,

123
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,080
right.

124
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,390
And now here I'm going to play the audio for the power up as well.

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,220
So it was the audio power up.

126
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,450
Um, a oh, this one, this is it, this is the one, so let's save it.

127
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,470
Let's come here.

128
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,150
Let's see how far have we come.

129
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,330
There we go, so you can see that the life works, so that's a good thing and it is just one to five.

130
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,130
There we go there with also works.

131
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,590
What about the super?

132
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,030
Now, it doesn't this bounce it off.

133
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:35,860
You can see they don't work, the super doesn't work the stick, it doesn't work, we increase the count.

134
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,960
And if I grab another extension, you can see that we basically increase the count.

135
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,150
It's 162 by 100.

136
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,290
It should be two something now.

137
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,110
It should be three three, three, 13.

138
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,570
Right.

139
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,860
So if you have something and if you are ready and if you get something that you already have, again,

140
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,370
counts is going to increase by four for 16.

141
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,420
Perfect.

142
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:07,990
So the extension and the other one, which was that the life they do work, we need to implement the

143
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,560
first stuff.

144
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,910
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to implement the color of the ball.

145
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,840
So if it is super, we are going to change the color of the ball.

146
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,500
So for that, let's go to our drawable function, so I'm I'm going to be keeping I'm going to be keeping

147
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,740
collapsing, I'm going to be keep class, what is the word I'm going to be keeping collapsing it.

148
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,320
That is the perfect form and grammar.

149
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,880
So for a second I was worried, like I forgot I've forgotten English.

150
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,920
So what we are going to do is no longer we want to only implement the ball color.

151
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,900
We want to check if it is a pop super, if it is a pop super, we are going to provide it with the pop

152
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,070
superstar color.

153
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,380
Otherwise you are just going to go ahead and show the color of the ball.

154
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,580
So first off, we need to check for Pop Super.

155
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:09,350
If Pop Super is true, if it is true, we are going to grab we are going to go to our pop type adult

156
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,300
super that color perfect.

157
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,720
We are going to grab the color.

158
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:20,210
Otherwise, if that is not true, we are going to just show the simple color of the ball.

159
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,900
So we have done that and you should see that we are going to be implementing this step by step.

160
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,010
So now the color of the ball should change.

161
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,480
There we go.

162
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,410
It changes.

163
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,890
So what do we have next?

164
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,500
Next, I'm going to apply

165
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,300
to a right.

166
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,710
So now you can see that I'm going to shoot first.

167
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,510
I'm going to show it to.

168
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,320
So if it is pop super, when we hit any brick, we don't want to bounce off that brick.

169
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,400
We want the ball to keep on collapsing the bricks.

170
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:07,130
That is what is the meaning of a super shot or a Super Bowl like with one like ball.

171
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,240
You will be able to to destroy so many like rows and so many bricks.

172
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,720
But you can see now with only with one, it is super.

173
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,880
We only destroy one brick.

174
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,590
That is not something that we want.

175
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,500
We want to destroy so many of them.

176
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,930
So let's see where we should implement that, so I'm going to go to our update bricks function.

177
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,310
So where is our update?

178
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,660
Bricks should be down here.

179
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,180
This is our update.

180
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,990
Bricks function.

181
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,630
So inside here, what I would like to do here is.

182
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:54,200
We are going to check we are going to say that this velocity is going to change direction whenever it

183
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,000
is not pop super, if it is pop super, we do not want to change the velocity.

184
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,150
We do not want to change the direction of the velocity.

185
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,170
So if it is not pop super.

186
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,820
Perhaps super, then we want to change, if it is pop super, we don't want to change the velocity,

187
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,000
velocity, direction.

188
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,870
So let's check that out.

189
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,530
I'm not going to grab it.

190
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,020
We are looking for a super.

191
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,110
Oh, lost it kind of there anyway.

192
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,750
Let's just do it one more time.

193
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,060
Let's see.

194
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,800
Let's grab the sticky.

195
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,110
Nothing should change.

196
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,860
Nasution should happen.

197
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,160
Scrub the extension.

198
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,530
We should check for the other ones as well.

199
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,360
So if I grab extension again, you can see that it went to 56 and now it should go once 107.

200
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:45,960
There we go.

201
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,020
It is 107 and it should be 158.

202
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,740
There we go.

203
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,950
Our life should increase to three.

204
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,280
It is three.

205
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,520
And now it should increase to four.

206
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,390
We should get another 50 here.

207
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,240
There we go.

208
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,520
It should we should get another 50 here.

209
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,900
And our lives should increase to five, why we are not it is random, completely random that these power

210
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,870
ups that you get, they are completely random and now you can see that the speed of the ball has increased

211
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,350
and it's not allowing me to grab these lives.

212
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,000
There we go.

213
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,030
This is the super one, sir.

214
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,170
So if I headed back, it should not bounce back.

215
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:31,930
There we go.

216
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,990
You can see it is not bouncing back.

217
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,680
And this is called the super shot.

218
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,510
So we have successfully there we go.

219
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,220
That's why I call it the Super Bowl, right.

220
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,280
It might not be accurate, especially I'm not going to continue talking about this.

221
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,830
Let's destroy all of them.

222
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,600
So we go to the next level.

223
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,390
And all of these like balls, everything should be the balls.

224
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,550
They're not reset, but the power ups are we are not going to get any power.

225
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,520
See, we had an extension.

226
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:16,730
The extension is gone and the ball color is come on, the ball color is reversed as well.

227
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,670
You can see that all of them are set to fall, but we still have our 12 balls there.

228
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,830
All right.

229
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
So we have done that as well.

230
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,370
The next thing that I would like to do is I would like to implement.

231
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:36,740
The functionality for the pup as sticky as well, so we are going to go to whenever we grab the sticky,

232
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,890
let's grab one and I have to show it to you.

233
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,710
So I'm just going to grab the sticky one.

234
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,070
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there we go.

235
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,740
So when we grab it, the color changes to dark green and the bounce angle is going to be there we go.

236
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,860
You can see it's sticky.

237
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,100
The bounce angle is going to be directly 90 degrees.

238
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,000
There we go.

239
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,480
So sticky, I would say, is the most powerful of them because it is going to allow you to do everything

240
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:18,210
that you want to eat, all of this and it when even when it's double in size, the color is still going

241
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:18,810
to be that.

242
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,560
So first off, let's go into a redraw panel, draw power of function in here.

243
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,060
We are going to check if it is sticky.

244
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:38,910
So if it is pop sticky, pop sticky, if it is that if pop stick is true, we are going to grab our

245
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,580
pop type dot sticky.

246
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,840
That sticky, that color, we are going to grab the color, otherwise it is going to be our normal panel,

247
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,330
so let's save it.

248
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,370
Let's come here.

249
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,160
If it is sticky, the color should change.

250
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,870
Come on.

251
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,800
Give me a stick.

252
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,400
We are waiting for a sticky one.

253
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,360
There we go.

254
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,150
So bounce it off.

255
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,550
There we go.

256
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,480
The color changes.

257
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,280
And if I get it a second time, 556, and this time it's going to be 107.

258
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,180
There we go.

259
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,970
And then one, 58 nerika.

260
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,140
Then 209.

261
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,410
There we go.

262
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,040
So if I increase the width, we should still have stick.

263
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,640
There we go.

264
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,560
We haven't implemented that as well.

265
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,840
Now let's make this sticky.

266
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,780
Actually sticky.

267
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,660
Right now, before actually doing that, what I would like to do is let's go to our reserve board function.

268
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:59,540
I want to make the angle 90 degrees when it is sticky, so instead of passing the angle here, we are

269
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,470
going to check if pop is sticky.

270
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,340
Now, this we have never done before inside a function call implementing a ternary operator.

271
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,990
We have never done this, I believe, and this is really cool that you can see all these different possibilities

272
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,590
with JavaScript.

273
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,340
So if it is sticky, we grab my third pie, which is one eighty divided by two, which is going to give

274
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,320
us ninety degrees.

275
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,060
We want the bounce angle to be 90 degrees, otherwise we just pass the angle.

276
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,550
So whatever the outcome of this argument is, that is going to be our main bounce angle.

277
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:46,880
So and I would like to say this, that whenever the more projects you create, the more the logic of

278
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,010
programming is going to develop inside your head.

279
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,320
OK, and you will be able to better understand, OK, what should I do when and if you're if you have

280
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,820
that question all the time with you, you just go ahead and create more projects.

281
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,870
That is the idea behind adding 50 projects to discourse in the first run.

282
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,880
Of course, in one hour, update the course.

283
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,620
I'm going to add even more than that.

284
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,680
Right, because each of these projects is going to teach you a unique thing like this.

285
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,900
All right.

286
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,000
And it is going to open a unique door of opportunities that you can do with G.S..

287
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,170
Right.

288
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,240
So we are done with that one as well.

289
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,580
So whenever we grab it, we should go straight up.

290
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,670
Now, let's go ahead and let's I'm going to implement this stickiness as well.

291
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,180
So we are going to make it sticky and we are going to go to our updatable function.

292
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,470
Of date ball.

293
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,090
All right, right here.

294
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:59,000
So in the update, both function right towards the end, what I want to do is I want to make the the.

295
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,570
Make the ball stick to paddle, if

296
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,680
sticky true, if stick is true, just make it stick to the paddle for this.

297
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,340
What we are going to do is.

298
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:28,840
So where is our Smain Ball function and, hmm, what I would like to do actually is I'm just going to

299
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:37,240
cut this comment and we are doing all of that inside this cell statement, bouncing the ball off the

300
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,730
panel.

301
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,980
We are not doing it inside the ball itself just in here.

302
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,600
So I'm going to paste it here and I'm going to get rid of, you know what for stuff.

303
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,260
I'm going to create the if statement.

304
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,450
So basically, we are checking if pop stick is true.

305
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:01,540
If a stick is true, then we are going to grab the X velocity of the ball X V and we are going to set

306
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,430
a zero and we are going to grab the Y velocity of the ball.

307
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:14,590
And instead of zero, basically we are going to make the ball static and then we else else of the paddle

308
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,620
is not sticky.

309
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,820
This is if the paddle is not sticky, then we want to spend the ball and we want the velocity to be

310
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,800
reversed as well.

311
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,860
If we are going to check when the ball hits the paddle, then we are going to check for a condition.

312
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:43,180
If pop stick is to make the ball static, if it is not true, then basically just bounce it off the

313
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,790
paddle and spin it.

314
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,690
That's what we did here.

315
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:56,740
Right, and we should be able to do this right now, so if I come here until our game, let's check

316
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,150
it out.

317
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,670
It is super, we know that this works, the rest of them work.

318
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,750
And if I do super, we are going to get get that easier sooner.

319
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,170
So there we go.

320
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,170
There it is, our sticky.

321
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,970
So it is sticky.

322
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:12,840
And there we go.

323
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,310
You can see that it's stuck to the to the power.

324
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,580
All right, but, uh.

325
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,890
Why is it moving towards the center?

326
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,230
Is it the same thing and now it is not?

327
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,340
So there is something actually missing here?

328
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,250
Right.

329
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,220
But first, what I would like to do here, we are going to fix that.

330
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,940
Don't worry about it.

331
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,270
What I would like to do is I'm going to cut this part.

332
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:47,180
And we are going to put it inside the update padel function, so this is the update ball function and

333
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,190
this is the update, a function in the update panel function.

334
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,030
We are going to put that right here.

335
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,850
So before collecting the pups, I'm going to put that here.

336
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:07,450
And we are going to say, if the ball's a why velocity is zero balls exposition, we are going to add

337
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,680
on to it the paddles exposition minus.

338
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,460
And I think you remember that we created a variable here and that was the last position.

339
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,600
So let last paddle X.

340
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:30,330
So the exposition, the last part, the last position of the paddle in the X direction to be more accurate.

341
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:41,450
So it should be paddle that X and in here we are going to subtract that position as well from there.

342
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,240
So this is going to be move the ball with the paddle.

343
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,260
So let's save it.

344
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,070
Let's come here.

345
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,770
Oh, this is our game in here, this this is where we are working, so if I grab this sticky.

346
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:06,450
Now, let's try to see now that is perfect because we want to subtract which wherever the parallel was

347
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:13,050
from there, from the from the exposition of the paddle itself, and we are going to give the ball that

348
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:20,580
position, which basically what it means is we want the ball to stick to wherever sided was, wherever

349
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,020
wherever is the point where the ball is heading.

350
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,290
It should stick there.

351
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,910
It should not go to the center.

352
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,380
We just displace the center of the ball here.

353
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,290
And congratulations with this hour, a game comes to an end.

354
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:46,220
So what I'm going to do now is we are we have one more thing to check with the sticky.

355
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,080
And I'm going to check it first and then we are going to wrap this up.

356
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,650
So I'm going to check all of the pups.

357
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,130
So with this sticky, when it sticks, it should go 90 degrees up.

358
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,570
So let's grab this.

359
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,100
There we go.

360
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,590
It goes exactly 90 degrees up.

361
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,220
And if we get super, then we get this cool magic.

362
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,540
And if I eat all of them, all the lives are increased.

363
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,820
Here we go.

364
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,100
Because the chance is 100 percent.

365
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,730
So there are like high chance.

366
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,290
They're like 100 percent chance.

367
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,960
If you hit a break, you're going to get a pop.

368
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,540
We should not lose it.

369
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,290
OK.

370
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:42,740
And just going to try to clear this round and I'm going to play the next round and then I'm going to

371
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,970
wrap this letter up.

372
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,110
There we go.

373
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,660
So everything should work perfectly fine.

374
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,290
Let's eat all of this.

375
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,300
And the high score is increasing.

376
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,180
You can see that.

377
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,570
And whenever we eat the power, the power ups, the best is not going to increase because the best is

378
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,580
going to increase off of this the brick.

379
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,930
So the next time you hit, the best is going to increase.

380
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,210
And at the end of the lamp, you're going to see that both of them are equal.

381
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,450
So I'm going to play through this and I'm not going to play another round.

382
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,420
Now, this is the ball, this is the super shot.

383
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,330
And the speed is increasing.

384
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,490
You can see the speed on the right and the console, you can't see that that is open.

385
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:46,260
That's why I didn't comment that one out in the original game as well, because I want to I want you

386
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:52,950
guys to really see what what's happening here from this start, from the start of that.

387
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,170
So I'm going to try to eat all of them.

388
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,770
So I'm going to try to losable that we have 60 of them, so that shouldn't be a problem.

389
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,790
And you can see that when we lose basically what we are going to do, what we actually lost is not only

390
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,260
alive, but all of our pups, all of our power ups and all of the speed.

391
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,160
Everything is lost to the wind.

392
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,170
OK, so there we go.

393
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,330
Come on, give me the spin is also random, and I'm going to as I told you, I'm going to play through

394
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,420
this level and this taking a little longer than expected.

395
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,010
So you should be able.

396
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,760
Yeah, there we go.

397
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,440
Give me a pop.

398
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,730
That is the extension.

399
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,780
And I may not be able to grab it.

400
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,670
Now, I didn't.

401
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,850
So there we go.

402
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,510
We should see a couple of more.

403
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,030
And the speed is increased.

404
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,200
Oh, right, all right.

405
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,220
Right, let's grab all of them.

406
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,250
This is super boom.

407
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,920
And everything is back to normal.

408
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:19,870
Everything is good with the world again, so the last thing that I would like to do here is I want to

409
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,350
check.

410
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,910
We have Rose.

411
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,170
We have we'll both spend four or five paddle speed.

412
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,770
We could put the paddle speed equal to the ball speed.

413
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,150
You could do that as well.

414
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,740
Game Lives is three.

415
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,360
You can the max level.

416
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,250
No, that is not.

417
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,740
Where is our max level?

418
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,500
That is ten.

419
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,980
I just want to check our game parameters if they're correct.

420
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,450
So.

421
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:51,960
Puff Chance is going to be zero point one and the score, because it is so unique and you know what?

422
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,310
I'm just going to stick to 50.

423
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,240
I guess that's OK.

424
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,790
Pop speed is zero point one five.

425
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,720
You could go ahead and increase it or decrease it if you won.

426
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:09,670
If you want if you want to play the game easier, then you would decrease the speed of the pump and

427
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:15,100
you would get it definitely and break a number of columns.

428
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,780
No Afroz and.

429
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,570
There we go.

430
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:26,620
So a lot of lines of code, I know, but and I just want to go ahead and collapse everything.

431
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,210
I'm not sure when I when you get the code, it is going to be collapsed or not.

432
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,630
But I like to think that it is collapsed.

433
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,490
It is minimized and everything is perfectly fine.

434
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,570
So with that, with all of that, our game comes to an end.

435
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:51,390
Feel free to modify to your own well and add extra layers, extra levels, add extra pops.

436
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,710
You could increase the number of rows, you could increase the number of columns.

437
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,400
The original is eight by 14.

438
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,990
But of course you can always go crazy with it.

439
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,260
So if you if I added 20, you can see that we have 20 columns.

440
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,950
If you are 200, you are going to get 200 columns.

441
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,870
I think it looks good.

442
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,940
Yeah, and then you would have to bounce the ball like four a thousand times.

443
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,460
There we go.

444
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,940
And you can see the pop as well.

445
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,070
The reason for that is the size of the pop is of the size of the columns.

446
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,590
So everything is interrelated.

447
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:36,470
In case you want to change anything, make sure that you check it for all of the situations and you

448
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,380
do not break anything in the code that set for this lecture.

449
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,860
See you guys in the next game, which is going to be as awesome as this one.
