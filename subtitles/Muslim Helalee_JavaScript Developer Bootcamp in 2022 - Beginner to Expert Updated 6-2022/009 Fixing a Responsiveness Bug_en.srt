Hi, everyone, this lecture, I want to remove a bug in the responsiveness of this game.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:17,410
All right, so you might have noticed that whenever whenever you go to inspect and so let's say let's

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,490
go to the responsiveness part and let's, for example, make this window big.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,610
So at some point you can see that the game is responsive and it is reacting very well.

5
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:35,710
But if I decrease it, for example, like let's reload it, you can see that below 718, it is going

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,180
to it is going to be buggy.

7
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,850
But when I decrease the with the height, it is going to go back and now I'm just going to go ahead

8
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,510
and decrease it.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,670
So whenever.

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,920
So let's go ahead and increase the whenever the width is going to be decreased less than the width of

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,150
the game that we can see.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,500
You can see that we have this kind of problem.

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:03,310
The reason for that is that we have in the create grid function where I have by mistake, I have multiplied

14
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,890
the width with the margin, but we need to subtract the margin on both sides from the width.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,110
So if I save it now and if I come here, you can see that the game goes back.

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,460
So it doesn't matter what the screen size is, you can still you can play the game.

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,270
For example, this is an iPhone six, seven, eight.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,480
I know these are pretty outdated devices, but this is the list that I have.

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,580
So iPhone six, seven, eight plus.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,510
So you can play the game against the computer.

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:39,810
All right, and it is going to be working fine, so I'm just going to go ahead and play that for a while.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,390
So I'm going to put one here and I'm going to put one right here.

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,010
OK, so let's put one there and human one perfect, so it works with that.

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,370
It is.

25
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,680
It should work with the iPhone X, just going to reload that page so it adjusts itself.

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,990
iPad, perfect, iPad pro very well.

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,060
And Surface duo and everything seems to be working perfectly fine.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,090
Just go ahead.

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:20,060
And just that with minus margin with the Times margin that was actually minus margin.

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,940
That's it for this lecture.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,850
See you guys in the next one.
