00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.569
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.960
In this letter, we are going to go over the JavaScript, part of the model project.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.820
All right, so first off, let's talk about how we want to accomplish this, right, because now now

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.600
we are talking about JavaScript and this course is about JavaScript.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.220
So we are going to dive very deeply into creating all of our projects.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.560
All right.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.460
So what do we want to do with this project?

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.080
We want to be able to, whenever we collect this, find out more button to see that model or that Pop-Up.

9
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.490
So when I click on it, we see something.

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.380
All right.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.270
And we have already coded the e-mail and the access, but the JavaScript part is remaining.

12
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.230
So first off, what I want to do is I want to grab this button, all right, because I want to apply

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.360
an event on it.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.560
And what is that event?

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.230
That event is a click event, because when I click on this, basically, we want to do two things.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.690
When we click on that button, we want to see the model and when we click on the close button, we want

17
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.850
to close the model.

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.530
All right, so first off, let's go ahead and let's grab the open button.

19
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.640
So I'm just going to call it Open Vitton with the camel case in JavaScript.

20
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.810
And we are going to say document that query selector.

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.370
We are going to select it through our query selector method.

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.980
All right.

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.580
Query, where is it?

24
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.270
Here it is, and now it's coming to our e-mail.

25
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.150
We are going to selected by its class, which is which is open.

26
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.150
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and pass in here a class, if you want to check

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.630
out if you that you have successfully grabbed that that element that you want to grab as you can just

28
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.500
go ahead and log it to the console.

29
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.630
So if we come here, we are going to see that, yes, we have successfully grabbed it.

30
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.190
And this is our but.

31
00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.630
Right.

32
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.570
So this is one way that you can check for it.

33
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.199
The next thing that I want to do is whenever I click this button and the model pops up.

34
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.190
So the model has a model container.

35
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.390
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the model container, because if you'll recall from our

36
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.160
success, we have said opacity zero and pointer events none to our model container.

37
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.560
Right.

38
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.820
So we are going to grab our model container as well.

39
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.130
Const I'm just going to call it the same thing.

40
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:40.800
But in JavaScript convention it is model container and we are going to say document that query selector.

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.130
What, what is that query selector and we are going to grab it by its class which is Model Dasch container.

42
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.240
All right, so this is these are the two things we need one more thing, and that is the close.

43
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.850
But so whenever we click on the close button, the model goes away.

44
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.560
So we are we need to grab the close button as well.

45
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:15.840
I'm just going to call it close B10 and document that query selector and what is the class for it.

46
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.490
Let's take a look at it.

47
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.810
It's model button.

48
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.240
I'm just going to put it right here.

49
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.440
All right, so now we have successfully selected our elements that we want to apply JavaScript on.

50
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.100
All right.

51
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.800
So what is the first thing that we want to do?

52
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.690
The first thing that we want to do is whenever we click this button, we want to see the model.

53
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.170
So we are going to select our open button and we are going to add an event listener to it because we

54
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.020
are listening for an event by the user.

55
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.770
And when the user clicks, we want to run a function.

56
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.680
Right, and what does the function is going to do so whenever the user clicks this button, the moral

57
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.440
container is going to appear?

58
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.040
Right.

59
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.910
So I'm going to grab the moral container or I'm going to say class list dot ad and we are going to add

60
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.570
what class?

61
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.780
We are going to add the class of show from Cyesis.

62
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:20.450
This dynamic class and this dynamic class has two events it sorry, two properties in it opacity one

63
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.860
and to events auto.

64
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.700
And when we say that, let's go ahead and let's click on it and now we can see our model, but still

65
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.210
this close button doesn't work.

66
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.830
So when we see our model, we want to be able to not see it as well so we can go ahead and refresh than

67
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.050
the model is going to go web.

68
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.230
But we need a better way.

69
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.870
We need a more dynamic way.

70
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.620
So.

71
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.020
Whenever we click on the close button, we want to get rid of the model.

72
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.510
All right.

73
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.540
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the close button.

74
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.680
Close button, and we are going to say an event listener, right, and what is it that we are listening

75
00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.900
for?

76
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.750
It is a click and when the click happens, we are going to run a function.

77
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.730
And what is the function going to do?

78
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.760
The function is going to grab our model container and it is going to articulate it is going to remove

79
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.680
the class on what is the class that we want to remove.

80
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.590
It is the class of show because when we remove this class from the model container, OK, and when this

81
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.400
is commented out, when we remove, it means it is commented out.

82
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.780
And when this is commented out, what styles are applied again, the opacity, none is applied again,

83
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.180
so the model disappears.

84
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.600
So now when I click on it, so you know what, I'm just going to comment these and so they work.

85
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.440
So when I click on this, find out more, we are going to see the model.

86
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.750
But when I click on the close, the model is going to disappear because the opacity is going to go from

87
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.830
one to zero.

88
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.110
Right.

89
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:02.520
So this is how this project actually works, and if you're still unsure about any part of this project.

90
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.820
You can go ahead and check out the thewe report that we have covered.

91
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.880
You can check out you can go ahead and check out the dumb or the functions and like, go ahead.

92
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.480
Like just a quick review of, like, how we can apply functions, what aren't even listeners.

93
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.750
I have covered them thoroughly in their respective chapters.

94
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.990
And if you do not want to check them out, that's cool as well.

95
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.280
You can go ahead and move forward and we are going to do a ton of dumb in this course.

96
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.630
So after like a couple of projects, you're going to get the hang of everything.

97
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.670
And the way that I explain this and the way we structure our code.

98
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.430
So this is it for this project.

99
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.200
It was a rather simple one.

100
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.750
We have a lot of simple projects intermediate and we also do have some pretty advanced projects.

101
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.140
All right.

102
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.700
But whatever until we get there, these projects, they lay the foundation for those intermediate and

103
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.980
advanced level projects.

104
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.830
So again, once more.

105
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.080
That's it for this lecture.

106
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.910
See you guys in the next one.
