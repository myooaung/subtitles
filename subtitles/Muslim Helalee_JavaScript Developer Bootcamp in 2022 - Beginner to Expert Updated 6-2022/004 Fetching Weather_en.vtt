00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.030
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.440
In this nature, we are going to fetch weather data.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.920
All right, so we have our axis key, so why not copy this axis key and I'm just going to say const

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.560
API key and I'm going to put it right here.

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.650
Now, I have created to access keys.

6
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.370
So in case you you run into a problem, you can grab this access key.

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.900
If you do not want to create an account, I don't actually mind it, I know it.

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.100
But because you're my students I'm going to give it to you for free.

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.380
Right.

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.500
So let's go ahead and let's I'm going to leave the access keys there.

11
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.600
So one is API key.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.490
Let's can I say one.

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.330
Can I say two?

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.530
We are going to use the one.

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.780
Right.

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.760
So let's grab our form first.

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.130
So I'm going to say const form.

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.620
The reason that we are grabbing that form is whenever we enter or we we do a submit event, then that

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.090
weather is going to be fetched.

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
So document that query selector.

21
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.690
It's like the Guardian that we did before.

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.070
It's exactly like that.

23
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:22.560
And I'm going to grab our weather details this because all of this information will be dynamically generated

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.890
there.

25
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:36.240
So I'm going to say const weather details and we're going to document that query selector and the class

26
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.580
is just details.

27
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.660
All right.

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.450
So we are going to grab our forum and we're going to add a listener asking to be submit very repetitive

29
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.450
and describe the event.

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.990
And to either prevent default and now what do we what do we need to get, we need to grab.

31
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.890
What it is that the user has inserted, what the user has inserted there, right.

32
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.789
All right, so how do we do that?

33
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.510
First off, let me close this and let's add some semicolons.

34
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.200
So we want to grab what it is that we grab.

35
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.310
We want to grab the input value.

36
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.250
We have done that several times.

37
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.260
So instead of actually grabbing it and then doing that value, I'm going to do that all in one line.

38
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.270
So we are going to say Consed, I'm going to call it location.

39
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:46.280
Location and working to set document that query selector, we have only one input and from that point

40
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.600
we want to grab the value.

41
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.210
So now let's call the get weather function and pass in that location.

42
00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.230
So this location now before actually going there, we need to go over the API.

43
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.220
Documentation, so the location is going to be our query, which is going to be right here, right?

44
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:19.360
So let's go ahead and let's say a sink function and get weather, get weather, and I'm going to pass

45
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.060
in a location.

46
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.930
So that is our query and the query is what the user has inserted.

47
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.830
Right.

48
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.400
And.

49
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.030
And here.

50
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.530
What I'm going to do is I'm going to call in a constant con, I'm going to call I'm going to create

51
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.890
a constant and I'm going to call it whether.

52
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.120
And you know what, I'm just going to call it a response to stay consistent and in here we're going

53
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.310
to say a weight fach.

54
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.840
And what is the euro that we are fetching from, let's come here.

55
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.310
It's this.

56
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.060
I'm going to fetch it.

57
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.730
I'm going to grab it all the way to questionmark.

58
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.990
You know what?

59
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.790
I'm just going to grab it completely so you know where where it is coming from.

60
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.370
And I'm going to change these to back ticks.

61
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.130
Now, what you need to do is you need to remove all the space in or this is going to throw ATRs.

62
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.000
Just put it there, remove this space, remove the space, remove this one, this New York, because

63
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.880
it's query, it doesn't matter if you remove the space or not, but the rest of them should not have

64
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.360
any space.

65
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.990
Now, inside here.

66
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.880
What do we have?

67
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.150
We have our your access key.

68
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.940
So we are going to say our access key is API key one.

69
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.110
Perfect.

70
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.080
And the query, we do not want a hard code.

71
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.650
New York.

72
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.760
We do not want a hard code.

73
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.330
The query.

74
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.060
So the query is going to be our location.

75
00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:02.430
The user enters now they're going to say, you're going, you know, I want to go up const response

76
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.700
data and we are going to say response dot Jason.

77
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.030
But we are going to wait until the response is completed and then we are going to log it.

78
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:28.670
Log get to the consul, so our response date, save it, API, key location, so if I were to do some

79
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.480
location.

80
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.670
OK, so let's bring it up.

81
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.120
Let's go to concerts.

82
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.390
If I do ha Herot, save it, get weather is not defined.

83
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:50.110
It is defined, oh, this is lower case, should be upper case typo, so Harat.

84
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.740
Evacuation is not defined.

85
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.800
Oh, why did they leave all the uppercase characters?

86
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.250
OK, so I hope everything is.

87
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.340
There is no other errors, so.

88
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.130
Right, perfect.

89
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.520
So we do get this.

90
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.000
So inside this, you can see that we have a bunch of information, but we are interested in the two

91
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.450
kinds.

92
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.340
So we are going to grab the current.

93
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.710
So you can see cloud cover feels like.

94
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.650
Let me bring this up.

95
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:35.140
Zoom and feels humidity, precipitation, pressure, temperature, visibility when degree wind direction,

96
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:44.200
wind speed inside the location we have country, we have latitude, longitude, local time, longitude

97
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.900
name region, time zone.

98
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.680
So we get all this info and we are going to display them on the air in our website.

99
00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:02.560
Like most of these I want to do, I wanted to do these dippie the images, but there were like astonishingly

100
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.090
low quality.

101
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.170
Right.

102
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.660
So I you know, I decided not to do that.

103
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.970
So we do get our results.

104
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.380
So the only thing remaining is just doing something meaningful with it.

105
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:20.650
So if I come here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create I'm going to call a function display

106
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.350
weather and we are going to pass in response data as the argument.

107
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.500
So now what are we going to do is I'm going to create that display, whether I'm going to say function

108
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.960
display, whether and this person or whether.

109
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.050
Weather, right?

110
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.720
And let's see, so first off, I'm going to create two variables and I'm going to say so we were working

111
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.280
in the current weather.

112
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:58.930
All right, and we were also working in the current location, so we are working in the current location.

113
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.570
That's why I'm going to grab both of them.

114
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.830
All right.

115
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.310
So the first one is going to be weather.

116
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.040
What was it?

117
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.090
The current?

118
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.190
And the second one is going to be.

119
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.150
Location, so whether dot location.

120
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.710
So we are going to grab data from weather, weather that current and weather the location, but you

121
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.070
know what?

122
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:29.040
I'm just going to go ahead because it's very, very long and it's basically very simple.

123
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.590
I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to paste it here.

124
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.940
What is this?

125
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.230
You might you might ask.

126
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.570
OK, so it's this this is all of the content that we had here.

127
00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:40.940
All right.

128
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.330
So from this div of titles, then just ignore that.

129
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.680
I'm just going to remove it.

130
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.810
Right.

131
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.550
This div of content sort of weather or is it weather info?

132
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.600
Then inside that we had titles and then extra info.

133
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:04.140
So if I come here you can see titles and then extra info and inside that temperature feels like local

134
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.030
time precipitation because there is a lot and it's basically simper, simple.

135
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.220
So there are some properties which are, which are present in one place and some properties which are

136
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.020
present and the other place.

137
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.670
Hopefully we have not saved anything.

138
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.080
So we do get a result.

139
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.370
We get our object, so you can see that I'm going I'm just going to show it to you.

140
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:32.180
So we have some properties which are present inside the current like cloud cover, feels like humidity,

141
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.950
precipitation and et cetera.

142
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:42.140
So if I come here, you can see that we have said whether that current is this variable and from there,

143
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:49.190
what current, whether we get the temperature, whether descriptions and again, the temperature feels

144
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:55.250
like local time, precipitation, humidity, pressure, cloud cover, cover, direction, degree, wind

145
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.760
speed.

146
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.050
And then we jump into LOKKE location, whether what is location, whether it's weather doeth location.

147
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.140
Let's take a look at that.

148
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:10.340
So close this this is whether the location we get, the latitude, the longitude, the name, the region

149
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.270
and the country.

150
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:19.270
So we get the latitude, the longitude, the visibility, the region and the name and the country.

151
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.750
So very simple.

152
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.400
We basically have this.

153
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:28.160
But inside these empty spaces, I'm going to zoom in and you can see that there is an empty space here.

154
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.960
There is nothing.

155
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.580
This is where we have inserted.

156
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:42.050
Our template literals this sea, so current weather temperature is going to give us a value in numbers

157
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.960
and we are going to add a superscript to it, which is going to be decreasing.

158
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.920
I'm sure you understand what this is.

159
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.920
It's super simple.

160
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.670
So so we get that and all of that belongs to our weather element.

161
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.840
So the only thing that we need to do actually here is grab our weather details.

162
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.850
Why weather details?

163
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.800
Because weather details.

164
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.230
This one is actually the diff that houses all of the other.

165
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.000
If I close it, you can see all of them are present inside weather details.

166
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.800
So let's say weather details, dot enter HTML.

167
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.550
We have grabbed our weather details right here.

168
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:33.380
Right, so that enter HTML and we are going to set it to our weather element and let's save it and let's

169

170
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.820
Hopefully it works.

171
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.500
So Randt, enter.

172
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.360
There we go.

174
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.210
So you could check any city, for example, Covel.

175
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.720
Yeah, it changed, Campbell is the same weird Zaranj.

176
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:59.110
Yeah, we do get Zaranj right, so let's go outside Afghanistan, let's go to Ron.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.530
Poona Poonawalla final hour.

183
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:35.850
Yeah, let's see, Guohua Center, Grue Cristoforo Colombo Airport, no, I'm sure I've misspelled it.

184
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.670
Anyway, let's let's move on.

185
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.910

Hmm.

189
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.890
Mostow.

191
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.640
Yeah, it does have W right, Moscow.

192
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.380
Let's go Paris.

193
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.280
We did Paris.

194
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.360
Let's do London.

195
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:12.150
We do get London, so let's do what is the capital of Germany, is it Munich?

196
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.050
I'm not sure it's geography is bad.

197
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.470
I'm not sure about that.

198
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:27.500
So the US, the Austria, I'm not sure about the capital of Austria, and I have no idea what any city.

199
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.130
So.

200
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:29.830
Hmm.

201
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.440
What do we get then?

202
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.720
We get to Barcelona.

203
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.110
I do know that Barcelona.

204
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.920
Football team, yeah, nedret, perfect, so we do get that.

205
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.190
What else do we have here?

206
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.150
We have so far this was Portugal, we have Spain.

207
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.590
So no, this was Spain.

208
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.870
Right.

209
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.790
So what do we have for Portugal?

210
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.200
I don't know.

211
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.210
Wow.

212
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.670
I'm really terrible at this.

213
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.290
Maybe I need to brush up my geography skills.

214
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.100
So let's go Athens.

215
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.650
I think I'm correct.

216
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:13.170
Yes, Chris, we could use we could do Cyprus.

217
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.760
I don't know about that either.

218
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.870
We could do.

219
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.520
Um hmm.

220
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:19.870
Hmm.

221
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:24.880
We could do Rio de Janeiro de Janeiro something.

222
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:31.090
Yeah, DeGennaro and for Argentina.

223
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:39.520
I'm not sure about that either, so I'm pretty sure we have established that I'm pretty bad at geography.

224
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.910
So that's it for this lecture and for this chapter.

225
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.010
See you guys in the next chapter.
