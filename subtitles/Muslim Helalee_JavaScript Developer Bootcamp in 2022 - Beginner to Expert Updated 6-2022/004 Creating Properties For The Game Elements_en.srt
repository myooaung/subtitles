1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:09,050
Hi, everyone, in this that you're working to create properties for our game elements, all right.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,000
So I'm going to come in here on top.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,720
And what I'm going to do is, first off, if you just open your this explorer, is it explorer?

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:26,040
Yeah, you can see that there is a folder called Sounds and we have ice core had our ice core and wall.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,130
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to call these sounds and then I'm going to create

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,610
sources for them and then we are going to call them whenever we get to those parts.

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:45,920
So first off, I'm going to say let our AI score equal to new audio.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,720
So the new audio is going to be a a function or an object function that we will be instantiating just

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,250
a moment.

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,660
So we have our eye score.

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,350
The next one is going to be a score.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,260
Then we have hit and then we have war.

13
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:04,750
Right.

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,200
So there we go.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,120
So now we have created these.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,060
What I'm going to do is I'm going to grab each one of them and I'm going to.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:19,810
Outsource to them, so I'm going to say our ice core s our C should be equal to we should go inside

18
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,870
this sounds folder and from there grab the arrow score.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,160
You know what?

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm just going to go ahead just to speed this process up.

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,380
I'm just going to copy paste all of them here.

22
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,430
So we basically grab them.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,120
That's it.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,250
So now that now when that's out of the way, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say the are I player

25
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,340
panel.

26
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,720
All right.

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,250
So let's create that.

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,850
So I'm going to say const.

29
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:56,570
Player parol are I this is our paddle that we are create here, so the first property that I want to

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,170
add in here is going to be the exposition.

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,340
What is the exposition going to be?

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,910
The exposition initially is going to be zero.

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,170
What is the Y position?

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,690
Right.

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,949
So what do we want to do now?

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,620
Whenever we create this game and we start, you can see that both of them are in the middle.

37
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,360
I know that the A.I. is moving, but our paddle is directly in the middle.

38
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,010
So the middle is the middle X is still zero.

39
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,510
We do not move in the direction, but a Y is completely in the middle.

40
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,040
So the height if I divide the height by two, we are going to get this.

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:43,760
And if I divide the paddles, the paddle by two, then we get directly the the we get exactly the center

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,860
of the paddle aligned at the center of the height of the canvas.

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,640
So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,580
I'm going to say why p so we are going to grab our canvas element tight.

45
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,680
And we are going to divide it by two.

46
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,230
Right, and from that, we could go ahead and we could grab.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:16,010
Our paddles with and just our paddles hard and just say 50, or we could just grab our paddles height,

48
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,250
which is 100 and divide it by two.

49
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,620
I know we have not created that.

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,230
We are just going to we are going to create it right now.

51
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,380
So the paddles height is going to be 100 pixels.

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,910
The paddles width is going to be 10 pixels.

53
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,440
You could increase the width.

54
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,110
I guess you could do that.

55
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,490
The color.

56
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,440
This is where you change the color.

57
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,170
So the.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,660
Sorry for the.

59
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:55,340
For the r.i, the color is is going to be D to E, D to E six 03, so this is the color for that and

60
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,080
the score is initially going to be zero.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,910
So this is going to be the three player panel for the I would basically have the same properties but

62
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,890
with different values.

63
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,020
So I'm going to change this air.

64
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,770
All right.

65
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,470
I'm just going to change it to Ehi.

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,440
So it's going to be so the exposition of that is no longer zero.

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:18,910
Why?

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:27,650
Because you can see that the r.i or our panel is right at the starting point of the width, but the

69
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:34,640
title for the A.I. is right at the farthest side of the width or at the canvases with.

70
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,990
But if I provide the canvases with and then provide like a width of 10 pixels, that width of 10 pixels

71
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,630
is going to move off the canvas and the pattern is going to come up right here.

72
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,770
So we need to decrease.

73
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,580
We subtract from the width of the canvas, the width of the pattern.

74
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,130
So the paddle appears on the canvas, not off the canvas.

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,110
So first off, I'm going to grab the canvas element with and from that I'm just going to subtract 10

76
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,680
because that is going to be over with.

77
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,610
So for the height, it's going to be the same thing.

78
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,820
We grab the height of the canvas and we divide it by two.

79
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,660
And from that we subtract half of the height of the paddle.

80
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:25,950
And that is going to give us the exact direct like the center point of the paddle is going to be at

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,170
the center point of the height of the canvas.

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,050
And the color for this is going to be orange.

83
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,320
In case you want to change of the colors for the eye, you can change it right here for the IRA.

84
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,510
You can change it right there.

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,990
So now that we have created that, there are two more things that I need to create in this lecture,

86
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,420
and that is creating the ball.

87
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,040
Let's create that.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,220
And for that one, I'm going to do as I'm going to create a constant I'm simply going to call it ball

89
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,640
and the exposition.

90
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,400
Now, whenever we start the game, where is the ball going to appear?

91
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,730
So let's let's take a look at it.

92
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,040
You can see that the ball appears right here.

93
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,630
So we're right here.

94
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,770
Right here.

95
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,340
As if we were to divide the canvas as high divided by two is going to give us this point.

96
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,640
But it's not actually doing is going to give us this point.

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,840
It's going to give us this point.

98
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,450
And then if we grab the canvas with and divide it by two, it's going to exactly give us this.

99
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,130
So we would have four parts of the canvas on the center point is right here.

100
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,410
So the exposition is going to be canvas element dot with divided by two, so we get the center, the

101
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:50,320
Y position is going to be canvas element, canvas element, dot height divided by two.

102
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,210
So we got that the next thing that I want to add to the ball is going to be a radius because it's a

103
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,580
circle, the radius is going to be 10 and then the ball is going to have a speed.

104
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,550
The speed I'm going to set it to seven if you want to increase the speed of the ball.

105
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,370
This is where you could increase that.

106
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:18,170
Now the ball is going to have velocity as well, because the speed without direction is nothing, we

107
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,940
need to provide a speed, the direction, and that's why we give it velocity.

108
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,380
So X V is going to be five.

109
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,250
The velocity in the extraction Y, V is going to be five.

110
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,860
The velocity in the Y direction, the color of the ball is going to be wide.

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,030
This is where you can change the color of the ball.

112
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,520
And after that, the last thing that I want to create in this lecture is going to be our net.

113
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,310
So I'm going to say let's create the object.

114
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,290
What is the position of the net?

115
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:56,750
Because the net is exactly in the middle of the canvas canvas with so we need to divide the canvas with

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,610
by two.

117
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,690
But what do we want to do?

118
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:09,050
Because the net has two pixels of width, if I want the net to be exactly in the center, one pixel

119
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:16,040
of the width should be on the left side of the canvas with the other pixel of the net with it should

120
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,070
be on the right hand side of the canvas, as with.

121
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,820
Right.

122
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,670
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to divide canvas by two.

123
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,280
That is going to give us the canvases metal point and I'm going to decrease from there one pixel.

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,500
That way our net, which is two pixels, half of it is on the left side of the canvas with the other

125
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,789
half is on the right side of the canvas with.

126
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,110
And then this net becomes directly in the center.

127
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:52,340
The Y position is going to be zero, the width is going to be two two pixels.

128
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,300
The height of each of the those segments is going to be ten.

129
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,900
And the color, in case you want to change it is going to be why this is where you change.

130
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,550
So I'm just going to come in this one end as well.

131
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,210
So creating the net, let's say that we should not see anything because so far we have not called our

132
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,250
functions yet.

133
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:21,710
So you can see that these functions now we need to call these functions like draw a circle and these

134
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,310
properties should be passed and within these functions call.

135
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,150
And that said, what that's what we are going to do in our next lecture.

136
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,580
So in the next lecture, what we are going to do is we are going to create our game loop.

137
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,280
See you guys that.
