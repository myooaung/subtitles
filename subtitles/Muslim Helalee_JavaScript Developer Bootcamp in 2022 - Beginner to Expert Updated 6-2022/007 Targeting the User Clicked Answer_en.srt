00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:07,660
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to target the users collect answer.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,560
All right, so what do I mean by that?

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:20,710
What I mean is whenever we run our game right and whenever we get to the questions, the user is bound

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,780
to click on one of these questions.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,200
All right.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,590
So now what do we want to do?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,010
We want to find out which answer has the user clicked on.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:30,790
All right.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,970
So before going there, I'm just going to click here and I'm going to say I think that these boxes,

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,780
they're a little bit large, I think, for our for our app.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,230
So let's go ahead and let's go into the where they are created.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,650
So this is where they are.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,270
So the height is one hundred and fifty, the width is 200.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,640
What if I grab both of them and I set them to 100?

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,730
I mean, what would that do?

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,240
So let's say let's come here.

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,750
They are definitely smaller, but I think the height is big, but the width is less.

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,770
So let's decrease the let's you know, let's keep the height as it is and increase the width, I think

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,810
looks better.

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,740
So let's go ahead and let's check out.

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,700
You know what?

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,210
I'm just going to implement it in here as well.

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,850
So the height is going to be 100.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:35,480
And let's say that, right, the height is decreased, let's just breeze through the questions and we

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,460
can see that everything looks good.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:45,740
I'm worried about the last one where it might not have enough plate, enough space, but it does have

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,520
I mean, we could we could, like, decrease the height and increase the width or we could just leave

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,880
it as it is and increase the with a little bit more.

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,120
I think this is better and.

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,530
And what if I grabbed this and I say.

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,430
Hmmm, a line item flex and.

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,740
Did it come down a little so.

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,990
Yeah, I did.

34
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,610
So it is going to come down because I think there isn't enough space between the question and between

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,330
the answers.

36
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,150
And I do believe that this looks better than what we had before.

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,590
It was very big, very bulky.

38
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,330
The answer and I think, yeah, it definitely looks way better, so I'm just going to implement it in

39
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,020
here as well.

40
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,620
So what I did is I increased the width to 250.

41
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:56,300
I decrease the height for our choices to 100 pixels and on the on the container for these choices,

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
which is the choice is container.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:06,920
What I've done is I have specified a line items to flex and this is going to align them in the vertical

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,280
direction towards the end of the container.

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,180
Right.

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,080
So place off center.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,590
We could we could because all of these I think they're all flex flex containers.

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,500
Yeah, they're all, they're all flex containers.

49
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,630
So I just went ahead and I said a line, not a line items.

50
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,900
Yeah.

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,080
I think everything is going to be towards down.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,860
Does it, is it look the same as this one.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,330
Yeah.

54
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,230
Yep.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,370
No it doesn't.

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,290
Yeah it does.

57
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,230
So yeah both of them are the same.

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,540
All right.

59
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,910
So now let's dive into what, what we were going to do originally and what was that.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:56,240
We are going to create an event listener and we are going to map where the user has clicked on which

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,060
of the four options has the user click.

62
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,860
So I'm going to create that event listener right beneath what we had there.

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,460
So I'm going to say answer.

64
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:19,649
All right, so what am I supposed to write here, so I'm going to write answer choices, eventless tenor's

65
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,160
listeners, listeners, all right.

66
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,330
And I'm going to come here and I'm going to grab all of our answers choices and I'm going to say for

67
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,300
each and we are going to run a function.

68
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,730
However, we do need a loop variable that is going to loop over all the answers choices and it is going

69
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,650
to select whichever the user has clicked on.

70
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,650
So we need a loop variable and I'm going to call this loop variable answer.

71
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,860
Correct answer.

72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,400
So what is the correct answer?

73
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,330
What is the answer?

74
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,470
That the user has clicked.

75
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,710
So I'm going to grab that click the answer and I'm going to say add event listener and we are going

76
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,510
to listen for a click.

77
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:12,880
Click this time, and whenever the user clicks at first, I just want to go ahead and I want to log

78
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,130
to I was about to say consider a log log to the console, just the event object itself, because I want

79
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,200
to show you something very cool, very, very, very cool.

80
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,850
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at this.

81
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,170
So if I click on this, we are going to get all this information.

82
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,810
It is going to give us a mouse event on the target.

83
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,540
Where is it?

84
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,430
Even if it is trusted?

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,530
Yes, it is trusted.

86
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
So that's a good thing.

87
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:48,410
And from there, we can get the target, the target as going to give us exactly what the user has clicked

88
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:48,650
on.

89
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,260
But this is not the awesome thing.

90
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,470
The awesome thing is if I come down here to I, we are going to get the inner text.

91
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,980
So the inner text is 100.

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,630
Why do I need to get the inner text?

93
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm just going to tell you why.

94
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,830
I'm going to come to our first question.

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,850
So this is the correct answer.

96
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,040
What is the inner text of the correct answer?

97
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,100
It is 100.

98
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:12,820
All right.

99
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,760
So what we are going to do, the way that that we are able to check, whether the answer that the user

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:29,900
has clicked on is true, is accurate or inaccurate is correct or incorrect, is we grab this text from

101
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,460
the browser from here and we check it against this correct answer.

102
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,120
All right.

103
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,620
If both of them match, it means that the user has clicked on the correct answer.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,400
If they do not match, if they are not equal to each other, it means that the user has not clicked

105
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,720
on a correct answer.

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,720
And thus we are going to print a red here.

107
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,590
If they are the same, we are going to print a green color here.

108
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,380
If they're not, we are going to print a red color.

109
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,470
Right.

110
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,140
So I'm going to show you I'm going to show it to you in action.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,480
So we went into the target and from there we went into our inner text.

112
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:22,750
All right, so not NATO, why it is in our text, so let's grab it to 60, let's save it and let's come.

113
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,990
Let's start let's click on 10.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,810
We are going to get 10, 100, 150, twenty seven.

115
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,820
So we get exactly what the user has clicked on.

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,370
And now what do we want to do with this data?

117
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm going to grab this data and I'm going to store it inside a variable.

118
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,860
Because now we get an answer whether or not that is the correct answer.

119
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,550
We are going to find out later, but for now, to be able to use it later, we need to store it somewhere.

120
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,480
All right.

121
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,760
And I'm going to say let the user answer.

122
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,570
All right.

123
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,640
So this is the user answer to be that.

124
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,250
So whatever the user has answered is going to be stored inside the user answer.

125
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,680
And I'm going to call a check answer function and I'm going to send the user answer.

126
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,720
No, I know we have not created this answer function, but we are going to create it.

127
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,980
So whenever the user clicks on any of the answers, we get the text and we pass the text inside this

128
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,380
function.

129
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,750
So let's come down and let's create that function.

130
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,190
Right.

131
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,700
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say check, answer, function.

132
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,650
All right.

133
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,620
So we are going to say function, check, answer.

134
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,310
Now, we are going to pass in a parameter.

135
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,870
The parameter is going to take into consideration the argument.

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,100
What is the argument?

137
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,060
The argument is the user answer.

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,250
So the parameter I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to pass and simply answer.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,400
All right.

140
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,970
It doesn't matter what you write in here, but it should be something that makes sense because we are

141
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,990
checking the answer.

142
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:15,020
We are actually calling this function with some sort of answer.

143
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,120
B, that A, correct or incorrect answer.

144
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:23,270
So now we want to know whether or not they use it when the user has clicked on a certain answer.

145
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,180
If that answer is correct, we want to do one thing.

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,290
If the answer is incorrect, we want to do another thing.

147
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,490
So let's talk about it.

148
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,200
And we are going to implement the functionality in our next lecture.

149
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,510
So if what the user has clicked on is it just this quick answer is not defined because we have not defined

150
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,050
this function, so do not worry about it.

151
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:51,530
So if the user clicks on any answer, we need to know if that if this is the correct answer, if it

152
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:58,490
is the correct answer, we are going to print a green into this score container, Intissar, into this

153
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,510
progress container.

154
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:07,540
If the user has clicked on a wrong answer, then we are going to print a red into this container.

155
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,240
Right.

156
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,390
So this is the logic that we want to do.

157
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,810
This is the theory behind the logic, the logic we are going to implement in our next lecture.

158
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,980
See you guys then.
