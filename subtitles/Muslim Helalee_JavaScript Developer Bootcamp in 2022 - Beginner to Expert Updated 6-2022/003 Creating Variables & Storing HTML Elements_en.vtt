00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.870
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.190
In this lecture, we are going to create variables and store necessarily e-mail aliments.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.680
And right now, because we are going to grab a lot of e-mail elements, I want to just dedicate this

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.990
lecture to selecting all of them and to explaining why we need to select those.

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.510
So I'm just going to go into two tabs in here.

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.750
I'm going to create two tabs and I'm going to go like like let's accommodate half.

7
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.450
I'm going to zoom out of it.

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.870
I hope this is still visible for you.

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.450
So I'm going to say Consed.

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.580
All right.

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.920
So the first element that I want to select what what is going on here?

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.150
So I'm going to say consed the first one that I want to select is going to be the balance element.

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.550
So I'm going to call it balance E-L and we are going a right, we are going to say document that query

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.390
selector.

15
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.630
OK, I hope this is visible.

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.230
You know what, I'm just going to zoom in a bit more to its original state and we are going to work

17
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.920
like this because I thought that was not readable enough.

18
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.260
And this is really important which elements we are selecting and why we are selecting that.

19
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.920
That's why I have dedicated a complete lecture to it.

20
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.090
And from next lecture onward, we are going to create our even listeners and functions.

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.290
So through the query selector method, what we are going to do is we are going to grab the balance.

22
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.080
Balance, and from there, we're going to grab the value diff inside, which we have.

23
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.000
OK, we forgot our quote inside, which we have our two paragraphs.

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.570
And through that, we are going to update the entire HTML of this by this value deth.

25
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.110
Right.

26
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.890
So the next element, why do I keep mis const misspelling that?

27
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.990
So the next thing that I want to grab is going to be the income total element.

28
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.080
Now the income total element is this element.

29
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.560
Right.

30
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:18.190
So I'm going to call it income total E-L element, document query selecter.

31
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.780
So I'm going to grab it by the class.

32
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.360
It is this one of course.

33
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
So we are going to grab this class and we are going to put it right here.

34
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.050
I mean, if this is really simple for you and this is like boring, you can skip.

35
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.490
But I think this is really, really important because these variables they create they they actually

36
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.070
create the backbone of this entire application.

37
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.320
And if you do one mistake here, your application is not going to work.

38
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.220
So this is really important.

39
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.480
And I want to make sure that I can understand it, OK, because this application is super important.

40
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.230
OK, so I'm going to say total element, document, query selector.

41
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.460
So for that we can have another class, which is the expense total.

42
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.260
You're going to take a look at does that class as well.

43
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.970
So if I come here, this is the expense total.

44
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.860
The next one is I want to grab our tracker.

45
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.180
So we are done with the header with selecting the budget header.

46
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.880
Now let's dive into the the income tracker and the expense tracker FISA like this.

47
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.920
We have a div inside which we have our you and our div of inputs.

48
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.760
So I'm just going to grab this div by its IDE and.

49
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.980
I'm going to come here and I'm going to say const consed income, I'm going to call it an income element

50
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.260
that was the income total, an outcome total.

51
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.820
Now, this is going to be the income element and the expense element.

52
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.810
So document, query, selector, query selector.

53
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.610
Where is the query selector.

54
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.460
Let's pass in the hash or the numbers signed for the, for the, for selecting IDs.

55
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.190
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to, I want to select the, the expense structure as well.

56
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.890
So I'm just going to call it expense.

57
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.540
Yeah.

58
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:36.040
So let's say document dot query selector that's passing the I.D. and the name is Expense Tracker.

59
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.550
We're just going to change it to expense tracker array.

60
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.120
And right after that I want to grab the all element.

61
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.750
Right.

62
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.390
This, this dif I want to grab that as well.

63
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.420
And this is why I've told you that there is a lot of moving parts and for that reason we need to grab

64
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:04.130
all of them because whenever we add something we need to change an entry or add like changing by changing.

65
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.050
I mean like adding or removing that entry from multiple places.

66
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.020
So we need all of that inside our JavaScript.

67
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.730
So query selector and that's selected by the ID.

68
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.070
The next one is, is going to be the income list.

69
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.450
Now these are the others which which are inside these trackers.

70
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.170
So this you.

71
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.120
Well, I want to grab all three of the US.

72
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.800
All right, OK, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say consed income list income.

73
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.950
I hope you're not getting confused with these variable names.

74
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.060
We have income, total outcome, total, pretty self-explanatory.

75
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.380
Income element.

76
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.430
Expense element.

77
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.950
Income list.

78
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.560
Right.

79
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.240
So document.

80
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.430
Document that query selector.

81
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.980
And we are going to grab our.

82
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.320
Income tracker, and from there, we are going to grab the expense because the class name for all of

83
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.540
our released list is the same, right?

84
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:23.580
So we have our income list, so I can just go ahead and grab this, do control DNA expense and save

85
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.780
it.

86
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.860
So now we have we have selected the list inside our expense structure.

87
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.970
Let me just do this a little and we can select our own list as well.

88
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.490
So all list, but we don't have an all tracker.

89
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.430
We just have an all and a list.

90
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.120
Now, we are getting close, of course, but I want to select all the lists in one and I want to store

91
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.640
them inside one variable as well.

92
00:06:52.830 --> 00:07:01.530
So I'm going to say lists, hence the extra s and I'm going to say query selector all because we have

93
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.770
three lists and I'm going to select them by their class.

94
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.990
They have the same class.

95
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.760
Next, I want to grab our tabs.

96
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.920
I want to select the tabs as well.

97
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.740
And here is this tab three.

98
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.980
This says this top this is tab to this expense for some reason is tab number one.

99
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.070
Maybe this should have been tab two and that should have been one.

100
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.150
Doesn't really matter.

101
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:34.280
So let's go ahead and let's grab our expenses first, so consed expense b10 I'm just going to call it

102
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.980
expense button, let's say document, document, dot, query, selecter, not all.

103
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.100
And we are going to grab the tab, number one, and we are going to call it the expense, we are going

104
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.080
to grab the tab number to call it the income and tab number three.

105
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.810
And we are going to call it the all all.

106
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.250
OK, so let's grab tab one.

107
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:12.120
And let's say to two, and let's say top three, so this is going to be our income income and this is

108
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.390
going to be all but OK.

109
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.560
And this Tab's they are of course they are the three.

110
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:27.120
But whenever we go ahead and we click on these 3s, we are going to see these lists, this entire container

111
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.760
for that specific track or be shown there.

112
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.870
For now, it doesn't show that.

113
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.350
So we need a dynamic way of doing that.

114
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.370
The next thing that I want to do is I want to grab our input buttons.

115
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:48.180
All right, and I'm going to say consed add expense, so the first one is going to be add expense and

116
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.960
we are going to say document, dot, query, selecter, not all.

117
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.800
And we are going to grab the add expense.

118
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.760
So this is this is the expense.

119
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.840
So where is the ad expense class here.

120
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.670
So this is, this is the input button.

121
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.470
So this is what we actually want.

122
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.590
These are the inputs.

123
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.500
So these are these inputs.

124
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.390
Whenever you click on this ad, this is an input type of submit.

125
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:17.760
All right.

126
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.490
But whenever you click on it, it is going to submit the information inside this four to this.

127
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.750
Well, all right.

128
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:36.300
So we grab grab the ad expense class from there, let's put it here, and we are going to grab the expense

129
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.120
title and expense amount.

130
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:45.170
But for now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the ad income as well.

131
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.800
So ad income.

132
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.920
And the class name is going to be income, of course.

133
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.850
Let's go ahead and check it out.

134
00:09:53.870 --> 00:10:01.610
Yes, it says that income and hmm, we don't have any further at all because we are not adding it.

135
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.840
They're they're adding it.

136
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.820
They're dynamically.

137
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:10.790
So the next thing that I want to grab is going to be the expense expense title.

138
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.690
Right, it is going to be document that query selector.

139
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.130
So what is the expense title?

140
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.680
This is the expense title and this is the ID for that.

141
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.570
So we are going to select it using the ID.

142
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.950
But let's put it right here and say it.

143
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:39.290
The next thing and final thing for our expense is going to be the expense amount, expense amount.

144
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.160
This is the amount that the user inserts inserts.

145
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.530
So this is the expense.

146
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.580
This sorry, this is the expense title and this is the expense amount.

147
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.040
We are basically selecting those.

148
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.600
So document that query selector.

149
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.890
Very selecter, let's pass on the numbers sign, so this is going to be the expense amount, so let's

150
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.670
grab it and let's put it right here.

151
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.860
We have the same things for our incomes as well.

152
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.670
Right.

153
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.500
And just going to increase this a little bit.

154
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:25.460
So instead of this expense title, we can just select all of them and we can say income title and we

155
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.670
should check the names in case they're not correct.

156
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.360
So we have income total inputs, we have income title input and we have income amount input, income

157
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.220
amount input.

158
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.830
So this lecture is getting close to its end.

159
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.020
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to.

160
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.650
Create some some necessary variables as well.

161
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:53.060
So I'm just going to call them necessary variables, very, very explanatory, right.

162
00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.040
And in here, what I'm what I want to do is I want to create an entry, an entry list.

163
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.390
So you might ask, okay, what is this entry list?

164
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.370
This entry list is equal to an empty array.

165
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:14.240
Whenever we whenever the user inserts something, inserts either an income or an expense, we're going

166
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.070
to push it to this array.

167
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:23.570
And this is the same array that I showed you in the project, introduction video inside the local storage.

168
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.130
So we have this array there.

169
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.890
All right, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use our destruct shrink once more and I'm going

170
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:39.280
to write balance, I'm going to grab the balance, the income and the outcome.

171
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.440
And I want to provide them with some initial values.

172
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.650
All right.

173
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.210
And I also want to use the restructuring assignment one more time.

174
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.740
And I want to select the delete icon.

175
00:12:52.750 --> 00:13:00.070
We are going to use them towards the end of this, towards the middle to the end of this project.

176
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.450
But we need them here.

177
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:01.930
Right.

178
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.170
And I want to grab the edit icon as well.

179
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:12.050
Because whenever the user clicks on the delete icon, I want to delete something and on the edit icon,

180
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.300
I want to edit something.

181
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:20.810
So for the edit icon, what we have is the class name is Faez F a Dash.

182
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:29.570
This is the delete icon and the other array item is going to be r dash f a dash edit.

183
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.170
Right.

184
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.050
So what you might be asking, what is this?

185
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:41.310
So instead of like creating three variables here and two variables here and ending up with five variables,

186
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:48.750
we can just use the word restructuring assignment where the balance is the first item of this array

187
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.150
and what it equals.

188
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.540
Two is the first item of the array in front of it.

189
00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:00.270
So this this number zero is going to be the value for the balance, for the value, for the value of

190
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:00.630
income.

191
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.850
This is going to be devar for the variable of income.

192
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.100
This is going to be the value.

193
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.890
And for the variable of the outcome, this is going to be delivering value for delete icon.

194
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.790
We are going to have this strength for the edit icon.

195
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.990
You're are going to have this string.

196
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:22.470
So instead of like creating balance, setting it to zero and then creating another variable and setting

197
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:28.860
that to zero, then outcome setting it to zero, we can just use restructuring, which reduces the number

198
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.790
of lines of code, and we end up with a cleaner code at the end of the day.

199
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:40.650
So this is going to be it for like creating variables and selecting Ishmail elements.

200
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:49.130
In the next lecture, we are going to go over some very, very basic event listeners for our tabs.

201
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.580
See you guys then.
