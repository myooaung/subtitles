00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,850
Hi, everyone, in this that year, we are going to talk about the logical end operator.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:17,280
All right, so these operators, these logical operators, they modify other boolean expressions, right,

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:25,090
and the first logical operator that we are going to take a look at is the logical end operator for which

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,320
the symbol is.

5
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:35,770
Double ampersands, this is the symbol to ampersands, all right, and the boolean expressions or conditions

6
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,200
on both sides should be true for this operator to return.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,800
True.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,280
Right.

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,520
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at an example.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,170
All right.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,450
So this is example number one.

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,330
And we are going to say f first off, let's create the body of our F statement.

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:05,370
Now, if a ten is greater than five and five is greater than four, we want to run to the console.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,540
We want to log to the console, a message of success.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,930
And then you guys can see we can we have successfully run that.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,290
OK, now this what has happened, what has actually happened here?

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,510
Now you guys can say we have we have talked about the F conditions are right and the F statements.

18
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,410
We have a condition.

19
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,400
And if that condition is met, then we run a certain code.

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,330
So what is our condition?

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,570
This doesn't seem like our normal condition.

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,950
This condition actually has two parts.

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,410
So F 10 is greater than five.

24
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,330
And the logical end operator says five is greater than four.

25
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,310
Then I'm going to run this code.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:58,000
And if even one side of this this logical operator, even if one of these boolean expressions are not

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,060
true, then I'm not going to run anything.

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,710
Right.

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,180
I'm not going to run anything.

30
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,580
So.

31
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,140
For instance, let's go ahead and let's say three.

32
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,160
Now, we know that 10 is greater than five.

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,440
Right.

34
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,180
We have talked about this greater than comparison operator.

35
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,310
And but but this is incorrect.

36
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,250
Three is not greater than four.

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,490
So one side of this boolean expression is correct.

38
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,810
The other side of the boolean expression or the boolean expression on the other side is not correct.

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,520
So this code of success should not run and let's save it.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,990
And we don't see anything.

41
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,640
Right.

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,860
So this is how this logical end operators work.

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,480
Both sides should be should evaluate to true for us to be able to run our code.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,510
So this is our first example.

45
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,260
In the second example, we are going to take it up a notch and we are going to check for more than one

46
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,590
condition that we have.

47
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,210
OK, so this is going to be our example to first off, I'm just going to go ahead.

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to set it to number 11 by default.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,410
Right.

50
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,760
And we are going to say F.

51
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:18,830
If age is greater than or equal to one, and it is an age is less than or equal to 12, then what do

52
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,490
I want to do?

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,460
I want to log to the console.

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,160
I want to log to the console.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,760
Minor.

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,250
Minor.

57
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,250
All right.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,380
I'm just going to copy this piece of code.

59
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:39,890
If age is greater than or equal to one and it is equal to 12 or less than 12, then we want to run to

60
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,640
the console minor.

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,770
Right now, what is the second part of this?

62
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,160
And the second part of this statement is going to be announced F statement because we are checking for

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,810
more than two conditions.

64
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,570
Right.

65
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:04,040
So what if the in the second condition, what do I want to do if H is greater than or equal to 13 and

66
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,180
H is less than or equal to 19?

67
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,640
What do I want to do?

68
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,910
I want to run.

69
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:19,670
I want to bring to the console teenager and I'm sure you guys have have I've got the gist of what I'm

70
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,300
going to do.

71
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,740
OK, so what in any other scenario?

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,920
In any other scenario, I just want to run an adult.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:28,960
Right.

74
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,960
So basically we are checking for three conditions.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,580
F the age of any person is equal to one or from one to twelve.

76
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,600
We want to run minor or if it is from 13 to 19, we want to run teenager or in any other scenario,

77
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,540
for example, if the age is 20, 21, 30, 40, 50, then we just run adult.

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,340
All right.

79
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,540
So now the ages 11, 11 is less than 12.

80
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,040
OK, so this condition is met.

81
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,870
That's why we we have printed to the console miner right now.

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,520
Let's go ahead and let's change it.

83
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,090
Let's check in at the boundaries, so the boundary is one here and 12 here.

84
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,550
All right.

85
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,720
And now you guys can see that both of the statements have been evaluated to true.

86
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,230
That's why this logical operator has been has run this code, because I'm just going to go ahead and

87
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,160
comment this one out.

88
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,900
This one is going to be one.

89
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm going to uncommented this one because 11 is greater than one.

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,270
So this condition is met and 11 is less than 12.

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,040
So this boolean expression is also meant.

92
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,040
So when both of the boolean expressions are met, we printed the cost of this and we do not even go

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,490
to the rest of the condition condition that we have created.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,900
Now it's comment that one out and let's check it out, the boundaries.

95
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:58,120
So if the age is one, it means age is equal to one and one is also less than 12.

96
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,730
So both sides are equal or evaluate to true.

97
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,580
So this code should run and now we see minor.

98
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,240
Let's say we are checking it at the boundaries.

99
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,590
All right.

100
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,990
Let's put it to 12.

101
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,910
We still should see minor.

102
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,770
Yes, we do.

103
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,380
Now, let's check it for more than 12.

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,760
All right.

105
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,150
Now let's check it for 13 and for 13.

106
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,890
Let's go ahead and save it.

107
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,370
We see a teenager.

108
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,280
And why is that?

109
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,920
Because 13 is greater than one.

110
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:34,630
OK, this side of the boolean expression has been evaluated to true, but 13 is nonetheless done, is

111
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,480
not equal, is not less than or equal to 12.

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,350
So this speed, this piece of condition is not going to run.

113
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,600
And then the algorithm is going to come to this one and check for this el-Fadl statement.

114
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,330
And this we see that the age is either greater than or equal to 13 and now this condition is met.

115
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,240
And in this part it says it's equal to or less than 19.

116
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,240
So 13 is equal to 13 and less than 19.

117
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,270
So this piece of logic should run.

118
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:04,870
Right.

119
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,970
And it works perfectly fine.

120
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,560
Let's put it to 14.

121
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,510
We still get teenager.

122
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,590
Let's check it at the boundary, which is 19.

123
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,930
We still get teenager and let's check it out, the 20.

124
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,890
So in any other scenario, we should get adult.

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,470
Which we do.

126
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,220
All right, so if it is 20, we are going to get adult, if it is, I don't know, like 35, we are

127
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,090
going to get adult.

128
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,470
I'm going to do one more.

129
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,840
And if even if it is like, I don't know, 68, we are going to get adult.

130
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,290
So that's it for this lecture and to see you guys in the next one.
