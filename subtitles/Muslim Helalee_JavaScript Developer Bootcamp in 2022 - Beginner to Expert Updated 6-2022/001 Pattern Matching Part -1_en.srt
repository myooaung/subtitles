00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,110
Hi, everyone, welcome to this chapter.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,180
In this chapter, we are going to talk about JavaScript, regular expressions.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,470
All right, so what are the regular expressions now by the end of this chapter, you will have a solid

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,770
understanding of regular expressions.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,520
So by the end of this chapter, you will know what they are, how can they be used and also why they're

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,040
useful.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,880
We are not going to die very, very deep into the into this topic.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,740
We are just going to go over the essentials, if you will, the essentials of regular expressions.

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,800
OK, so let's start with the definition.

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,000
Regular expressions.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:52,850
They define a search pattern that can be used to look for specific combinations and patterns in size,

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,450
strings and numbers or in general inside characters.

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:05,300
So let's say if you have like like a paragraph and you're looking for something, you can like find

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,630
it through regular expressions and you can replace it with something else.

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,510
You can check if a paragraph contains an email address or if that paragraph contains a phone number,

16
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,860
you can do that with regular expressions as well.

17
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,740
Right.

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:31,160
And you can also validate five forms like the username, the password, like the client side validation.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,610
I'm not talking about the back end validation, not on the client side validation or the front end validation

20
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,530
of forms can also be done through regular expressions.

21
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:50,570
So what the way that I'm going to go over these regular expressions is we are going to have four lectures

22
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,480
at first, four different lectures, and each of them is going to be like matching part one all the

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,380
way to Part four.

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,020
Then we are going to discuss two cases.

25
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:08,960
In the first case, we are going to talk about how we can limit a user name when the user enters inside

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,850
a forum element.

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm going to show you what that is going to be like dynamically in the JavaScript.

28
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,750
But you can apply to a form as well, even though we have like I'm going to show you how you can do

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,430
that as well.

30
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,230
And we are going to have another two cases.

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,340
So the second case is going to be a password validation kind of thing.

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,660
And then we are going to have a matching part five and then we are going to finally the final lecture

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,320
is going to be we are going to talk about the replace method.

34
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,770
So in the matching lectures, we are going to have many examples and I'm going to go over them.

35
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,660
And in each example, I'm going to give you like a different taste of regular expressions.

36
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:58,280
And if you if you want to resource what I know, this is not an exhaustive resource for regular expressions.

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,680
But this these are all the essentials that you need to get started with the regular expressions.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,260
This is a text file.

39
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,720
It is inside the folder.

40
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,380
Right.

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,670
And by the end of this chapter, you will understand what all these they mean.

42
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,350
So at first I know they might seem like weird or a nonsense or whatever, but we are going to go over

43
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,550
that.

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,060
So first things first.

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,760
What I what I'm going to do is instead of writing, I'm just going to paste this sentence.

46
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,710
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

47
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:39,380
Now, this is the sentence inside which all of the English letters, alphabetic alphabets, all of them,

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,560
they have been used here.

49
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,310
So this provides a very good use case for us to use regular expressions.

50
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,530
So we have this sentence now.

51
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,590
This sentence is inside the JavaScript.

52
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,320
All right.

53
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,720
And we have this sentence now.

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,720
We are looking for something inside this sentence or we want to grab a certain piece of information.

55
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,730
We want to like like extracted from this sentence, if you will, like, in the hacking kind of thing.

56
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,730
So what are you going to do is I'm going to write example, another example.

57
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,110
That is the wrong tree.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,640
Example one.

59
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,130
All right.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,060
So in this example, what I'm going to do is we are going to match a word in a sentence.

61
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,980
So what we are going to do is we are also going to put it right here.

62
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,390
So we are matching a word in a sentence.

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,840
Now, this is case sensitive and we are going to use the test method.

64
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,370
So, you know what it is that we are actually doing in here.

65
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:47,030
So now using this let key word, we are going to create a regular expression that is going to search

66
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,800
for a pattern.

67
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:56,690
Now with like with any other variable, we need to give this regular expression in name, which is completely

68
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,570
arbitrary.

69
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,060
So I'm just going to say, Regg, one X, because this is example one.

70
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,910
All right, so that's why I've just provided one.

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,330
I think we are going to have 28, almost 28 examples.

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,050
So here is where the regular expression is, create the way that regular expressions they're created

73
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,260
is.

74
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,990
We just provide two slashes, not set to forward slashes.

75
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,960
And whatever you're right in here is going to be a regular expression.

76
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,190
So what I want to do is I want to look for the word dark inside the sentence.

77
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,000
Right.

78
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,330
And when I grab that word dark, what I want to do is I want to test.

79
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,770
So we are going to use the test method.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,420
The test method is going to return a boolean.

81
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,730
So it is going to be either a false or a true statement.

82
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,370
All right.

83
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,410
And I'm going to store that the result of that search inside another variable.

84
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,450
And I'm going to call it search one result because this is example one.

85
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,960
We're going to have almost 28 examples.

86
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,500
Now, whenever you want to test something, first off, you you provide what it is that you want to

87
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,650
test it, what it is that you want to test.

88
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,550
It is a regular regex, one Regg, one X.

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,610
What do we want to test it with?

90
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,360
We want to test it.

91
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, this is the test method.

92
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,700
It's a string on which to perform the search.

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,170
So what is the string that we want to perform the search on?

94
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,790
It is our sentence.

95
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,940
And at the end, we are just going to go ahead and cancel the search, one result.

96
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,830
So if I say that because there is dog inside the sentence, we get through.

97
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:57,170
I could zoom in, I could bring this up, I could like no, not not do that, like do this and I can

98
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,460
increase the width of this window soon.

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,090
And there we go soon because the word dog exists in this sentence, we get a true.

100
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,540
So that was our very first example.

101
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,070
All right.

102
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,190
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment these right.

103
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,890
And we are going to dive into our second example because we are going to have more than one example

104
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,410
in each a lecture.

105
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,320
So example number two, now you get what these are.

106
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,500
We just provide something and which we tested against this a sentence that we have and we either get

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,520
true or false.

108
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,090
Now, before doing this, I should have probably done like this as well.

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,150
For example, let's say if we want to test, if we have cat inside this and if I say it, we get a false.

110
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,620
So this is a boolean expression, right?

111
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,730
So in the second example, what it is that we want to do, we are going to match for multiple words.

112
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,420
We are going to search for a pattern of multiple words and we are going to use the or this is the pipe

113
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,110
character.

114
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,100
Right.

115
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
So let's go ahead and let's create the reject.

116
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,510
So this is why this is right to X, right.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,310
And I'm going to say what I'm what it is that I'm looking for.

118
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:24,310
So I'm looking for a dog or this is on top of my turkey or a fox or brown.

119
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,280
So if it finds any of these, it is going to return.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,640
True.

121
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,799
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy those lines here because it takes a lot of time like

122
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,620
writing them and I'm going to change this one.

123
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:47,220
To to and I'm going to save it and we get through and let's say we change this combination to blue and

124
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,340
can't we still get through because dog exists.

125
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,880
Now, let's change it to bird, bird, bird.

126
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,450
We get a false because none of these words, they are inside the sentence.

127
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,560
So this was the second example.

128
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
Let's dive into the third example.

129
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,070
In the third example, we want to ignore this case sensitiveness.

130
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,670
And here is where I'm going to give you a flag.

131
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,730
So we have flags inside the irregular expressions as well.

132
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,940
So we are ignoring the case sensitiveness using the flag.

133
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,460
We are still using the test method.

134
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,370
Right.

135
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,200
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create my regular expression projects.

136
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,600
Right, for X.

137
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:44,520
And the way we can do this is so if I go ahead and if I write quick, like with smaller case and let's

138
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,490
copy these two lines, let's put them right here.

139
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,960
Let's do this because this is this is not regular expression for this number three.

140
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,440
And we should get these three and we should say three so we get a false.

141
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,080
The reason for that is we do have a quick here, but this quick is uppercase and this Q is lowercase.

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,090
So outside this regular expression, I'm just going to provide I and then when I say it, it is going

143
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,320
to say so.

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,890
It doesn't matter what the casing is, it is going to return.

145
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,080
True, because the case sensitiveness is ignored.

146
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,890
So this was our third example.

147
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:31,860
Let's dive into the fourth example, all right, so in the fourth example, what I want to do is we

148
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,520
are going to use another method in here, and that method is the match method.

149
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,220
All right.

150
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,210
And now looking at the clock, I can see that it has been ten minutes.

151
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,120
So what I'm going to do is we are going to postpone the second part of I thought we could create it

152
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,080
in one video, but that's OK.

153
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,270
So from example number four, all the way to example number eight, we're going to complete in our next

154
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,660
lecture.

155
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,970
I don't want to feel like rushed like I'm rushing through this course because we are we have covered

156
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,710
so much.

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,010
No, no, it's not like that.

158
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,900
The most critical chapters of this entire course, they are yet to come, which are how the JavaScript

159
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,930
works, like the inner workings.

160
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,200
So I don't want to I don't want to, like, sound rushed.

161
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,920
Right.

162
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,200
I don't want to make this course, like, hasty.

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,820
I don't want to be hasty, whatever.

164
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,990
