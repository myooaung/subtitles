1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,020
In this next year, we are going to create our chart.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,270
All right, so let's go ahead and let's dive into this chart.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,090
So what is the XHTML element that is involved with that?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,580
There is only one d'Hiv, which has a class of chart, but there is nothing inside of it.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:26,670
So we are going to create a canvas element dynamically and we are going to appended to this chart element

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,460
chart diff.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,300
All right.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:35,770
So I'm going to say CONSED chart should be equal to let's grab our dif our very, very lonely diff.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,420
So we are going to say query selecter.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,830
What is the class.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,140
The class name is Chart.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,180
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say consed.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,760
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a canvas element.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,020
So I'm going to say document dot, create element.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,670
So we are creating an element.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,470
And what is the element name.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,980
The element.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,610
Name is canvas now that we have created the canvas.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,800
Let's go ahead and let's give it dimensions.

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,710
Dimensions.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,660
Right.

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:25,010
You're going to say canvas dust height should be equal to 120 pixels and canvas dot with it should be

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,030
equal to 120 pixels because we need to grab a like.

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,260
Like, Square kind of lost the war, and I'm sure you remember that we had a canvas inside the success

26
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:48,190
and the canvas had a border of one pixel, white and solid.

27
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,580
The reason that I did that was to visualize our canvas.

28
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,830
I know we cannot still see it.

29
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,730
We cannot still see it because we don't know where the canvas is.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,930
Actually, right now.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,160
We should appended the canvas has been created inside the JavaScript, but it has no physical actual

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,580
relationship with any HTML element.

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,740
So we are going to grab our chart and we're going to say append child, please adopt this child.

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,630
What is the name of the child canvas without quotes.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,670
So because canvas, this is a valid JavaScript identifier within it, we don't need quotes, so this

36
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,430
is where our canvas is going to be present, is going to come.

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,120
This is where it is going to look like it is going to be created.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,810
And that's why I did a border, because I just wanted to visualize where the canvas is and how I can

39
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,100
create a circle inside the canvas.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,130
So what I'm going to do here, as I'm going to I know we have not officially started talking about Kashima

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,120
five canvas.

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm I will make sure towards the end of this course that I will include chapters four or five canvas

43
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:14,100
like drawing and animating so we can create like awesome games in this course, which we are, because

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,370
in case you're like interested in game development, then you can go ahead and go down that route with

45
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,310
JavaScript as well.

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,550
So I want to I want to do that.

47
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,850
But for now, we are just focusing on the project at hand, which is the budget app, not the canvas

48
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,570
aspect of it.

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,930
Of course, I'm going to be explaining it, but officially we will be starting a later initializing

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,320
a 2D context.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,060
Now, whenever we say canvas, we can only draw 2D and canvas.

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,440
So a height and a width.

53
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,340
I know using those two dimensions we can like.

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:00,370
Elusively, we can create 3D objects, but the actual context is going to be 2D like a height and and

55
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,350
width, so we need to initialize that.

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,060
So we are going to say const.

57
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,440
And I'm going to call it context.

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,180
I could call it like a context.

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,890
Usually it is called Sirtex, but I think this is not correct because it starts with a number.

60
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,900
So you know what I'm going to say context to.

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,800
All right.

62
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,860
Let's see if it works.

63
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,760
So canvas, does it get context?

64
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,070
So we have talked about this method.

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,630
Get context.

66
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,160
What is the method?

67
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,810
I've also given you the the resources for this.

68
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,260
So it says the identifier idea of the type of canvas to create Internacional or whatever 2D context

69
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,540
using canvas that give context to.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,670
Right.

71
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,440
It gives you a lot of information that you do not need.

72
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,250
So now we have created this context.

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,950
Let's go ahead and let's grab the context and let's provided with a line with.

74
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,240
So what is the line with the line with is going to be ten pixels.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,110
What is going to be the radius of the circle?

76
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,790
The radius of the circle is going to be 50, not pixels, just 50.

77
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:25,160
All right, let's provide some space there and now let's actually draw our.

78
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,650
Circle draw, circle function.

79
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,760
All right, so we are going to create a function, we are going to call draw a circle called a draw

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,340
circle.

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,930
So we are going to pass in a parameter as an argument.

82
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,450
Color as a parameter.

83
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,710
A ratio.

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Because the circle is going to be divided between the income and the outcome, we need some sort of

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,830
a ratio there and there is another another what should I call it?

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,960
Another key word with the ARC method that we have.

87
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,610
And that is going to tell us what there was, whether the circle should move clockwise or counterclockwise.

88
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,460
Right.

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,880
So antique clock.

90
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,820
Anti clock.

91
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,470
Why so it says anticlockwise.

92
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,650
If anticlockwise is true, it is going to start going like from right.

93
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,440
All the way to like bottom like top left.

94
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,740
So, so if I come here.

95
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,600
So it is going to start from here and is going to go there this way.

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,860
This is anticlockwise.

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,930
And if it is clockwise, if anticlockwise is false it is going to go clockwise of course.

98
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,690
And it's going to start from here and go like this.

99
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,580
Be like that.

100
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,820
All right.

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:57,750
So in here, first off, you're going to grab our context and we are going to say stroke style.

102
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,220
What is the stroke style?

103
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,620
The stroke style is going to be the color.

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,230
Where is the color coming from?

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:12,090
The color is actually these colors because we have specified a certain color for income and a certain

106
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,460
color for expense.

107
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,430
So we are going to use these colors and these colors.

108
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,630
They're going to be universal.

109
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,540
So you can see that this is green.

110
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,110
This is tomato.

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,850
Tomato.

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,910
All right, so this is the stroke style for this circle to work or to start drawing, we should tell

113
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,100
it to begin path, right?

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,740
And now we should provide it with the information, with the actual coordinates.

115
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,370
Where do we want to start?

116
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,540
How big should it be?

117
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,410
What what is the radius size?

118
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,060
What is the line with?

119
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,340
What is the starting angle?

120
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,800
The ending angle, everything.

121
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,850
So the arc first off, we need the X and we need the Y.

122
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:05,160
OK, so the X, the the X should be 60 half of the canvas dimensions.

123
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,030
The Y coordinates should also be 60.

124
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,020
Next we have radius, we have specified the radius there up top and then we have start angle, start

125
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,400
angle is angle is going to be zero and then we have the end angle.

126
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:28,440
The angle is going to be math dot pi times two, which is going to give us 360 degrees and we are going

127
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,780
to multiply it by ratio.

128
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:39,720
Now ratio is going to specify which amount of the circle should be a should be adjusted for the income

129
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,140
and which amount should be adjusted for the outcome.

130
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,820
We are going to define the ratio.

131
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,980
Don't worry about it.

132
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,860
And we are going to pass in the anticlockwise, all right, so this this is going to create a circle

133
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,830
for us, but we need to tell it to start creating as well.

134
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,770
That's why we're going to say stroke as well.

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,150
So you know what?

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,730
Before doing anything else, I want to call this draw circle function.

137
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,420
Now, I'm going to pass in three arguments.

138
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,940
So the first argument is going to be color.

139
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,560
So let's pass and read.

140
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,530
The second argument is going to be ratio and I'm going to pass in zero point five.

141
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,170
The third argument is going to be anticlockwise, which is a boolean expression.

142
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,290
Right anticlockwise is a boolean expression, either true or false.

143
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:39,360
So if I say false, it means that anticlockwise is not true, meaning that we are moving clockwise like

144
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,720
this.

145
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,980
Like that.

146
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,710
I know you can't see it, but, you know, I'm basically showing it to myself.

147
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,250
So if I come here, we can see this.

148
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,900
So this movement is actually clockwise and the color is red and this is the line with which is 10 pixels.

149
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,000
And this this is the start angle is is going to be right here.

150
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,350
This is the radius.

151
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,340
And then we are going to have a 360 degree rotation, which is the math that PI two and the ratio is

152
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:15,120
going to say how much ratios should be specified for the income and how much for the outcome, because

153
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,730
ratio is point five.

154
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,890
We have 360 degrees here.

155
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,880
Times point five, we are going to get 180.

156
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,660
That's why we see half a circle.

157
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,470
So if I if I set it to point to five, we should see a quarter of a circle.

158
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,110
We see a quarter of a circle, like a half of half of a circle, right.

159
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,420
So this is going to be a ratio and I'm going to show you if the anticlockwise is true.

160
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,430
So if this is true and you know what?

161
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,190
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to give it a green.

162
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,320
So they are really distinguishable.

163
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,890
So this is anticlockwise.

164
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,570
This is true.

165
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,490
And you can see that it comes here.

166
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:08,300
So it doesn't matter what the ratio I've specified here, it is going to grab all of the circle because

167
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,440
we need a circle.

168
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,340
At the end of the day, we are going to create a circle.

169
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,440
So, of course, this was just for experimentation purposes.

170
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:25,190
What I'm going to do here is I'm going to create another function and I'm going to call it up date chart

171
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,840
y update chart, because we are going to call this function inside.

172
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
This Abduh file.

173
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,700
And we want to call it whenever we update the UI so that I'm going to do in the next lecture.

174
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,890
See you guys then.
