00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.780
Hi, everyone, I'm super excited to see you here, and I assure you, you will be amazed by this course

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.520
before starting this course.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.390
We need to go over what this course offers so we know where we're starting and where we are ending.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.690
So first, we are going to dive into what JavaScript is as an as a language.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.120
Then we're going to talk about the different JavaScript variables, data types and basic grammar, basic

6
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.410
syntax of JavaScript.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.120
After that, we are going to talk about JavaScript logic and flow control.

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.210
And following that chapter, we're going to talk about two of the most important JavaScript data structures,

9
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.610
which are arrays and objects.

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.580
Each of these chapters and upcoming ones, they will be accompanied by multiple many examples.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.520
Then we are going to dive into JavaScript loops functions and the document object model.

12
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.040
The document object model is going to be the connection point between JavaScript and e-mail and see

13
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:12.570
assess right after we are done with the basic JavaScript concepts, I'm going to give you a 27 different

14
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.970
projects which are going to cover the basic to intermediate level JavaScript.

15
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.090
After you're done with these chapters, we are going to step into advanced JavaScript topics.

16
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.340
So we are going to talk about regular expressions in which I'm going to give you two different use cases

17
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.310
for regular expressions.

18
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.230
Then I'm going to give you data structures and functions from the advanced JavaScript perspective.

19
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.240
Now, whenever you're starting to learn a new programming language, it is it is of utmost importance

20
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.560
to know how it works.

21
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.830
That's why I have dedicated four different advanced chapters to the inner workings of JavaScript.

22
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.910
We're going to talk about scope and then advanced scope hoisting and closure after we know how JavaScript

23
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.270
works.

24
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.240
It is time for us to explore other paradigms of JavaScript, such as object oriented programming.

25
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.410
After we're done with OLP, we're going to talk about how JavaScript handles asynchronous programming.

26
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.410
These chapters will be followed by 12 projects in the areas of regular expressions, object oriented

27
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.280
programming and asynchronous programming.

28
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.820
By the end of this course, you're going to have yet another interesting and cool part, and that is

29
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.380
JavaScript game development.

30
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.660
So I'm going to dedicate an entire section to game development.

31
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.210
And in there you're going to know how this HTML five Kanavis API works with JavaScript and afterwards

32
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.110
you're going to have 11 different games that you will be able to build with JavaScript.

33
00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:01.290
Now, notably, the most advanced and biggest the biggest games are going to be our the connect for

34
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.460
game, the breakout game and the dot connector game.

35
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.930
Now, within these games, I'm going to show you how you can get started, get set up with game development

36
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.590
and JavaScript.

37
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.790
What are different concepts that you can leverage to create better games, as well as how you can get

38
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.340
started with writing AI or artificial intelligence algorithms with JavaScript.

39
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.640
So whenever you're creating a multiplayer game, you can also create a game which you can play against

40
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.990
a computer API.

41
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.420
So with all of these cool concepts and chapters and projects ahead of us, let's not waste any more

42
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.520
time and dive right in.
