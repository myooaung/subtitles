00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:08.200
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to remove superheroes from the local storage.

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.830
All right, so now so far, what we've done is whenever we enter a superhero inside this little ad,

3
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.580
this input, this form, and when we when we click this add superhero, it is going to be added to our

4
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.880
list as well as the local storage.

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:33.710
But the problem and the final thing that we need to accomplish here is that whenever we remove a superhero

6
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.680
from this list, the local storage is not being updated.

7
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.180
So if I were to remove, for example, Hawkeye from here, you can see that we still get high Harki

8
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.510
here.

9
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.990
Now, the problem arises whenever we reload the page.

10
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.710
So when we reload the page, because on the reload, our superheroes are going to be retrieved from

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.790
the local storage.

12
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.060
And because we did not remove it from there, the high is going to return back.

13
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.800
Right.

14
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.300
So that's what we are going to do in this lecture.

15
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.430
So first off, we are going to calm down, come down here.

16
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.840
And I told you before that we are going to come back to this section because what we are trying to do

17
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.370
is whenever I click on this trash icon, I want to remove the superhero from the list as well as the

18
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.250
local storage.

19
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.350
So removing it from the list that's done.

20
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.290
So let's go ahead and remove it from the local storage.

21
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.150
What is the class that is related to local storage?

22
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.460
That is the superhero class.

23
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.800
I've just commented this out, this class.

24
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.360
So it is visible where the classes are, where they start and where they finish.

25
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.930
So what we are going to do down here, first off, we need to find out which superhero it is that we

26
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.580
have clicked on.

27
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.280
We know what it is because of the Trijicon.

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.520
But the thing is, we need to match this superhero on the list to the superhero, which is to the same

29
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.169
superhero which is stored in the local storage.

30
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.910
What do I mean by that?

31
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.500
So if I click on this trash icon and if I say one, I click on the trash, I can say, let's come here

32
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.680
and say the e-mail.

33
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.790
Let's go over the theory first and then the implementation.

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.250
So all the superheroes are inside this list.

35
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.640
Right.

36
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.200
So if I say if I click on this trash icon, remove a fuel, that's very simple to do.

37
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.580
Right.

38
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.090
That is very simple to execute, but which you tell it is that this that the that should be removed,

39
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.700
which you will is we don't know which one it is because all of them, they have the same I.D. We don't

40
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.170
know which you it is that we need to remove.

41
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.980
We know that when we collect the trash removal you will, but which you will do, we want to remove

42
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.820
or specifically which object it is that we want to remove.

43
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.690
So each Udall is represented by an object.

44
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.600
If I click on this, it is going to remove a object and it is going to remove the first one.

45
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.830
But that's not what we want.

46
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.020
We want to find out our target superhero.

47
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.340
And then when we find out our collect superhero, then we can remove our target superhero.

48
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:28.350
So the cliqued superhero is going to give us the superheroes name associated with that trash icon.

49
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.060
So with this trash icon, what does the superhero name associated?

50
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.810
Superman.

51
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.970
So the reason that we are not going to use universe is because we can see that we have multiple, multiple

52
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.840
occurrences of the same universe.

53
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.290
So if I click on the trash icon and if I say when I click on the trash, I can remove Marvel, it is

54
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.200
going to remove all occurrences of Marvel.

55
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.310
We cannot say power because power is not unique as well.

56
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.700
We need something that's unique.

57
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.010
For example, like Superman flies, Shazam flies, ihram and flies and maybe like you like the flying

58
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.320
thing more often.

59
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.720
So that's why you like you like the superheroes.

60
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.960
So if you if you see when I click on this trash, remove the fly, it might remove multiple superpowers.

61
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.269
What is the unique thing about this?

62
00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.260
Less that is the name of the superhero.

63
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.120
So what I am going to do here is I'm going to say Consed and I'm going to call this variable collect

64
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:34.280
superhero and we are going to say E, which is going to give us the target, the where we're where we

65
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.760
click.

66
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.520
Then we go into the target from the target.

67
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.410
We are going to grab the previous previous element.

68
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.610
Aliment.

69
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.850
Sibling.

70
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.330
So what is this previous element, sibling?

71
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.670
All right, so it's been five minutes, but I'm not going to cut this because we need to complete this

72
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.310
part.

73
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.850
All right.

74
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.760
This is all very, very connected.

75
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.530
So if I cut it, then the connection, the continuity is going to be disturbed.

76
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.150
So what?

77
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.860
I'm going to go ahead and call our comment out this part and I'm going to say council log.

78
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.990
First off, let's track our eat our event object, which is related to this click event.

79
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.440
So if I come here and if I click on this trash and if I come inside the console, we can see an event

80
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.910
as far.

81
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.990
So let's reload.

82
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.420
Let's recheck it.

83
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.700
So if I click on this, this event is fine.

84
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.040
So what do we want to do when this event is fired?

85
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.940
We are going to go into Target.

86
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.780
The target is going to give us that specific element on which the click the click event has been fired.

87
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.380
And you can see that the class name of that is if a dash of a trash, we use this class name to remove

88
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.120
that element.

89
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.650
That's besides the point at this point.

90
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.500
We want to know we want what do we want to do?

91
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.050
We want when we click on this troche icon, we want to remove the superhero from the local story.

92
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.340
So what I'm going to do, the way that I'm going to tackle this is we are going to go into the previous

93
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.270
element, siblings.

94
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.470
So what is the previous element sibling that's come in here?

95
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.960
Superhero, less real, less data.

96
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.680
So, for example, this is the trash icon that we click on, right?

97
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.760
So this is the illi.

98
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.510
Why is it.

99
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.620
It should be.

100
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.700
This is the trash icon that we click on when I click on the trash icon.

101
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.440
OK, get the previous element sibling, which is this one.

102
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.590
This is this Ellyse, the previous element sibling.

103
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.390
Then the second layer of the second previous element sibling is going to be this one and the third previous

104
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.140
element sibling is going to be this one.

105
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.480
And what is the text content of this one.

106
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.750
It's Superman, because the way the the reason that we are going three levels of previous sibling is

107
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.670
because we want to get to the Superman.

108
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.420
When we get to the Superman, we're going to get the text content.

109
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:12.950
When we get to the text content, we are going to compare this text content with this text content,

110
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.810
which is right here with this one.

111
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.120
When both of them match, then we remove it from the local storage.

112
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.850
Right.

113
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.100
So this is the theory.

114
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.980
Let's go ahead and let's implement it.

115
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.310
So we have gone to either target and then that previous element sibling.

116
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.960
Now, what is the previous element?

117
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.120
Siblings, text content, content that's come down.

118
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.870
So it's aim.

119
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.190
So right away.

120
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.150
Let me just if I reload, this is going to go away.

121
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.310
So think of it like it is humor.

122
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.020
So we are at the power level.

123
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.110
So if I go back one level more, we are going to go to the universe.

124
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.170
So one level more.

125
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.850
And if I come to the text content, OK, it's right here.

126
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.710
You can see that this is the universe, right?

127
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.190
Marvel.

128
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.410
You can grab the text content.

129
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.300
You can you can grab the outer text.

130
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:13.880
It's not specifically the text content that you can grab, but you can grab the text content, the outer

131
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.630
content.

132
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.230
You can grab the inner text as well, or in this case, you can grab the inner shimmer.

133
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.460
So it's it's your choice between these four.

134
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.750
You can grab any of them.

135
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.750
I'm just going to grab the text content, which makes the most sense.

136
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.760
So let's go one step backwards, one more step.

137
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.110
And if I come here, you can see that now the inner text is Harki.

138
00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.590
It means that we are at the level of the name.

139
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.210
So we have selected the name.

140
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.070
And if I come into the text content, we are going to see the same thing.

141
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.460
So we set it up.

142
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.510
Target that previous element, sibling, that previous element, sibling dot.

143
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:56.930
Previously on either target, previous element, sibling dot, previous element, sibling Dutroux.

144
00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.020
So on the sibling and then dot text content.

145
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.710
So.

146
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:09.350
If I say let me just copy, this one is very difficult to write and let's put it here.

147
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:15.170
So I'm going to say previous Alamin siblings, we had three times that.

148
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.540
All right.

149
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.340
So we are going to say, let's copy it.

150
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.950
Let's say that previous 11 siblings and that present elements, sibling and then text content.

151
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.450
So now let's say that the page is reloaded.

152
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.850
We are inside the console.

153
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.460
So if I click on this Strache, we need to get we should get Antman.

154
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.200
A cake and a target of undefined.

155
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.610
K e o.

156
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.370
There are two times this target should be one.

157
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:49.870
Say it once more and let's come here, so if I click on this, we get flash, you can see we get the

158
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:56.680
hero name Superman Black Panther, and then we get Takai in.

159
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.530
And if I reload, we are going to get them back.

160
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.220
But the reason is because we have not removed him from here.

161
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.570
So now that we have successfully grabbed this one, I'm going to do as I'm going to store it, store

162
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:18.350
this result inside this variable constant, and I'm going to get rid of this console lock.

163
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.670
So what do we want to do with this result in here?

164
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:28.690
We are going to call our superstore superhero class and we are going to create another method.

165
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.860
And I'm going to say remove superhero and what it is that we are going to pass.

166
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.500
Yes, we are going to pass the collect superhero.

167
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.310
Now, we are yet to create this method.

168
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.450
So let's go.

169
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.890
You know what?

170
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:47.080
I'm not going to create it in this video because there are actually two things that we need to do.

171
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.990
The first thing is grabbing the superhero, the superhero, and the second thing is passing it inside

172
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.630
this function, which we are going to create in our next lecture.

173
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.090
So see you guys then.
