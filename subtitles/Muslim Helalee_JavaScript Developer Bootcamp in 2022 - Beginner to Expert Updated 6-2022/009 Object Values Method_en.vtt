Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.500
In this lecture, we are going to talk about the object values method, right?

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.060
So in the previous lecture, we talked about the object keys method where it extracted all the keys

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.239
from an object.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.070
What about you want to extract all the keys from the object?

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.230
We do have an idea, a method for that as well.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.460
All right, so what I'm going to do here is we're going to create a variable and this time we are going

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.780
to call it values.

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.750
I'm going to call the object.

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.250
All right, all right, so it says that provides this object, it provides functionality common to all

11
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.670
JavaScript objects.

12
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.660
What is the functionality that we are looking for?

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.760
The functionality that we are looking for is to be able to grab all the values from five colors for

14
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.820
object and print it to the console.

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.730
OK, so let's say volunteers save it, and now it again returns an array where it's green, blue and

16
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.370
brown, we can loop or loop through this array as well to grab each of the individual items.

17
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:23.160
So we're just going to say not far going to say for each and let's remove the array from there.

18
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.480
It says the element.

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.350
What is the element?

20
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.150
The element is going to be value.

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.040
All right, and we don't need actually curly braces because we were just running one line of code so

22
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.430
we can very well say cancel the log and we just value oops.

23
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.320
It should pass in an either, and now we get green, blue and brown that said, see you guys in the

24
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.070
next lecture.
