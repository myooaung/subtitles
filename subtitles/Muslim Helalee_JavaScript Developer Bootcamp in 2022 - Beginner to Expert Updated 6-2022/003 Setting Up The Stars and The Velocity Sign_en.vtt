00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.450
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:08.980
In this lecture, we are going to set up our stars and also create the random sine function.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.570
All right, now, before diving into the random sound function, what I want to do is I want to create

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.710
our stars now.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.270
All of our stars are going to be present inside an array.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.180
So I'm going to say stars and I'm going to initialize it to two.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.460
I'm going to declare it as an empty array.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.930
Right.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.620
And now let's grab our star speed.

10
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.890
Now, what are we going to do is I'm going to create our star speed because our stars speed is actually

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.650
a fraction of the screen per screen width per second.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
So I'm just going to add in another so that stars speed.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.230
So its speed times.

14
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.930
Window or canvas canvas element?

15
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.540
I'm just going to set it to width because canvas with that with is actually window dot in there with

16
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.910
it doesn't matter which when you do, both of them are equal to each other.

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.030
So this is going to give us the speed.

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.780
Now we need we need to kind of velocities.

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.670
We need a horizontal velocity and we need a vertical velocity.

20
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.920
Right now.

21
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.400
If you come here to our maths, maths is fun.

22
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.070
We can see that there is a speed and velocity.

23
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.050
So what is speed?

24
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.950
What is velocity?

25
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.790
Now, if you say a car is moving like at a speed of like 60 miles per hour.

26
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.270
Now, that is how fast the car is moving.

27
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.510
And that is called a speed that is called the speed of the car.

28
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:52.310
But if you say that the car is moving at 60 miles per hour in the north direction, if you give it direction,

29
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.410
then that then that is no longer speed.

30
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.360
That is velocity of the car.

31
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.100
The velocity of the car is 60 miles per hour in the north direction, or indeed like in the left direction,

32
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.630
right direction, south direction.

33
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.270
Whenever you provided a magnitude, then that is if you provide a a direction that then that is going

34
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.620
to become a velocity.

35
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.410
So we have to kind of units in physics, one is scalar and the other one is vector, so scale a scalar,

36
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.680
I think it's called scalar.

37
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.750
I'm used to using these names in Persian in my own language.

38
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.890
So it's a bit difficult for me to, like, pinpoint the name.

39
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.730
But, you know, like my university helps a lot because I studied my university in English.

40
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:52.030
So I'm comfortable with saying this is scalar is something that only has a a magnitude, it has a an

41
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.600
amount.

42
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.160
But vector is something that has an amount and has a direction.

43
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.960
So velocity is vector.

44
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.630
It means that it has a direction.

45
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.550
So whenever I say horizontal velocity, it's no longer speed because speed is neither horizontal nor

46
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.120
vertical.

47
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.560
Speed is just speed.

48
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.910
It doesn't have a direction.

49
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.190
Wind speed has some direction.

50
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.410
Then it is going to become a velocity.

51
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.490
So I'm going to say horizontal horizontal velocity.

52
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.300
Now you know what velocity is, right?

53
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.830
And there is your reference.

54
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.930
You can go over this entire thing.

55
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.460
There are a lot of examples.

56
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.830
You can just go ahead and read all about that.

57
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.070
There is even a cool picture there as well.

58
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:46.220
So this horizontal velocity is going to be our star speed now we say we know that the speed which has

59
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.300
a direction, so we are going to multiply it by a direction.

60
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.890
So what is the direction?

61
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.970
This is where our random sine function comes in.

62
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.430
So random sine and I'm going to tell you why a random sight and because we want to change the amount

63
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.850
because some stars are moving fast.

64
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.530
OK, some stars, they're moving faster than the others.

65
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.880
We want to randomize this velocity as well.

66
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.170
So random.

67
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.140
And that's it.

68
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.490
So why random sine the random sine is just going to give us a negative or a positive.

69
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.830
And if it is positive, it means that the star is moving from right to left.

70
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.650
If it is negative, it means that moving from the right.

71
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:46.960
Sorry, yeah, if this if it is positive, it moves that, if it means that I'm sorry, let me reiterate

72
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.260
this.

73
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:57.320
If the random sign gives us a positive sign, then it means that the star is moving from left to right.

74
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.170
If the random sine function gives us a negative, a negative sign, then it means that the star is moving

75
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.230
from right to left, right.

76
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.000
So basically this guy is just going to give us a sign.

77
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.000
That's why it's called Random Sign.

78
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.450
So to get a random sign for stuff, let's create that function.

79
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:35.120
OK, and we do we called this random site and this function is going to return a return math dot random.

80
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:44.520
And what do we want to do so if this math, we don't the random returns zero to zero point nine, if

81
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:53.520
if what it returns is greater or equal to zero point five, then the sign is going to be positive.

82
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.290
Or if it is less than zero point five, the sign is going to be negative.

83
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.560
So this is a ternary operator.

84
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.870
We have done this right.

85
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.210
So basically we are we have set up our stars and we have created the random sine function.

86
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.760
And what we are going to do next is we are going to now we know what the horizontal velocity is in the

87
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.330
next lecture, we are going to we are going to specify our vertical velocity using the Pythagoras's

88
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.960
theorem.

89
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.180
And this is one of the places where your mathematical skills, they are put into practical use cases.

90
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.270
And and for most of us in Afghanistan, we always thought, OK, like mathematics, why do I even need

91
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.600
that?

92
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:48.390
But this is like a practical example of the Pythagoras's theorem that we are going to use in this project.

93
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.850
That's why I created this.

94
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.570
That's why I love this project, because it's it's all about mathematics.

95
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.640
And of course, I'm in love with that as well.

96
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.830
And also, we are going to create we know how we can create loops if we want to randomize the location

97
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.880
of something or randomize the size of something, ring a bell.

98
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.200
Right.

99
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.350
We did that.

100
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.170
And we are going to do both of those things in our next lecture.

101
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.820
So see you guys then.
