00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.790
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.450
In this lecture, we are going to talk about some of the properties and methods.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.020
All right, so starting from this lecture for the next few lectures, we are going to talk about some

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.930
of the most useful properties and methods of dumb because dumb is an object.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.880
So objects have properties and methods and we know what a property is, what a method is from our object's

6
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.560
chapter.

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.980
So the first property that I want to talk about is the inner text.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.430
The owner takes property, gives us the text as displayed on the Web page.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.100
So let's go ahead and let's say we want to grab the entire text of this paragraph in JavaScript and

10
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.240
for example, we want to do something with it.

11
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.900
So first things first.

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.420
We have to select that paragraph.

13
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.150
So I'm going to say when I selected, I'm going to store it inside this variable called Terra and I'm

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.410
going to say document.

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.970
Dot and let's see, let's take a look at the paragraph, what I'm going to do is I'm going to selected

16
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.220
by the elements selector or by name selector.

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.720
So I'm going to say query selector versus query selector, and I'm just going to pass in here.

18
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.840
So when I go ahead and cancel the log, it what I'm going to do is I'm going to say para dot enter text.

19
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.070
And when I say it, this is exactly the text of this para.

20
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.730
Right.

21
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.890
So this is the text of the Para that we have acquired right here.

22
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.540
So the header text gives us the text as displayed on the on the on the Web page.

23
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.690
So this is the text as displayed on the Web page.

24
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.490
All right.

25
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.940
So this is that text.

26
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.050
See, this is how it is displayed there.

27
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.020
And the next property that I want to talk about is which this brings us to the next property.

28
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.380
And that property is the text content.

29
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.070
So let's put it right here and I'm going to call it.

30
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.590
Well, actually, it has a name, so it is text content.

31
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.070
Now, text content gives us the text as displayed in the HTML document.

32
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.340
So let's take a look at this one.

33
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.160
And we see that this is how this text is displayed.

34
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.960
For example, I'm going to pass in there.

35
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.470
It doesn't matter if I provide it, it's going to it's going to go back because we do have our code

36
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.270
formatter on.

37
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.770
So if I were to go to preferences settings and I say format on save.

38
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:54.310
And save and just take out that tegmark and let's provide some spaces, some breaks there so it doesn't

39
00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.720
matter how many line breaks you have in the email, what page you're going to see or text in a continuous

40
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.090
flow.

41
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.930
So so what the text content allows us to do is it shows the text exactly as it is in the e-mail document.

42
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.490
So for that, what I am going to do is I'm going to do let's go ahead and let's select this paragraph

43
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.660
as well again.

44
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.570
And this time, instead of inner text, we are going to say text content.

45
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.570
And when I say it.

46
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.950
Oh, there are two, so let's change it to para one, para one, let's save it.

47
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.310
And now you guys can see this is basically the difference between the inner text and between the text

48
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.600
content is can see that here we have a lot of indentation when you can select it.

49
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.780
This is called indentation and it looks exactly as we have it in here.

50
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.440
We have indentation before Lorem and we have indentation before Laura.

51
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.780
And this is how we have arranged our text.

52
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.070
Right.

53
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.030
So if I do provide a an enter there or a breakpoint there and then it is going to look like that.

54
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:15.310
But this in a text is not going to change because in text shows us the text of any element as though

55
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.870
it is on the Web page.

56
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.450
But this in her content, it shows us the text as though it is in the document.

57
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.550
So these two are done, the next property that I want to talk about is the area HTML, which kinda is

58
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.730
similar, but it isn't actually.

59
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.110
So let's go ahead and let's copy that.

60
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.190
Let's put it here.

61
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.960
Let's bring this one down and let's change it to three.

62
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.620
All right, so this is called inner turmoil and an e-mail is all caps.

63
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.600
OK, what does this do?

64
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.890
ANTM gives us the text and the elements.

65
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.610
We can also create elements.

66
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.310
All right.

67
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.740
With this interactive map.

68
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.440
So you could say that in our e-mail is the most powerful of of the two methods.

69
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.150
But the inner text and text content, they do have their applications.

70
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.660
Right.

71
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.650
So let's save it.

72
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.890
And now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead.

73
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.390
I'm going to give you two examples.

74
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.430
So I'm going to say example one.

75
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:31.710
And the example one, I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to grab the UFO and document that query selector

76
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.230
and we are going to grab it by the element selector, which is ULE itself.

77
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.330
And we are going to say, you have that inner HTML.

78
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.500
All right.

79
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.080
Well, actually, this is the second example.

80
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.210
So I'm just going to go ahead and consider.

81
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.810
Log it.

82
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.130
We are going to see you have that inner.

83
00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:03.410
Tim, let's save it, and this is what we get now with the inner text, what we got was the text and

84
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.970
the Web page, so typically we don't see any well, never we never see our e-mail tags and the Web page

85
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.480
because that is the job of the browser to translate our e-mail document to a complete Web page.

86
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.660
All right, imagine seeing this on every Web page and you're not a developer.

87
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.540
I mean, this this is going to ruin your life forever.

88
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.470
All right.

89
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.520
So what text content did was it?

90
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:39.130
It grabbed the text from the e-mail document, but it never grabbed the elements, the tags, the actual

91
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.560
opening and closing tax.

92
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.920
But what an original does is it grabs those tax.

93
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.600
It grabs them.

94
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.230
All right.

95
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.970
So this is what we get.

96
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.400
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead to preferences and I'm going to say format and

97
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.990
save, and I'm just going to do that and I'm going to receive it so we can see our semicolons.

98
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.900
So this is our example.

99
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.780
Number one, let's go ahead and let's talk about the example.

100
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.430
Number two.

101
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.530
Now what why is enriched special?

102
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:19.320
Because within our e-mail, we can create e-mail elements from within our JavaScript files.

103
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.880
Now, this is where the DOM is getting more and more powerful.

104
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.650
Not only we can select e-mail elements, we can create them as well.

105
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.890
Now, I mean, how cool is that?

106
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.220
Right.

107
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:39.540
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our you once more and I'm going to select a document that

108
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.280
query Select Tor and we are going to pass and you will.

109
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.950
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say you are incorrect HTML.

110
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:54.700
I'm going to add in a plus sign here and now we are going to create a A.T.M. element.

111
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.120
So how are elements created?

112
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.530
First, we have an opening track, then we have the content.

113
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:09.900
Then we have for some for most of the elements, we have a closing time except for the ones which are

114
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.340
self-closing tax like breaks in Estima or like images.

115
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:23.070
So when I say that nothing changes here, but in the DOM, in the demo document, in the Web page,

116
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.570
we can see that item number four has been added.

117
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.450
So this is cool.

118
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.300
I mean, this is really, really, really cool.

119
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.659
So let's go ahead.

120
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.440
Let's consider log it to the console as well.

121
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.840
So you will enter it here.

122
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.680
And when I save it, we are going to see our fourth item right here.

123
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:54.090
So this is the upper hand that interest him has over the rest of the two properties, but each of them

124
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.580
has their own unique place to be used.

125
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.170
Right.

126
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.050
And with this, interestingly, you can create any e-mail element that you want off your choice, off

127
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.950
your desire.

128
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.050
All right.

129
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.130
So enough of properties.

130
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:13.300
We have talked about three properties, and I want to cover two methods in this lecture as well.

131
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:20.370
So the first first method that I want to talk about is going to be the get attribute method.

132
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.550
And it does exactly what how it sounds like.

133
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.410
It grabs the e-mail elements attribute.

134
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:37.290
So let's go ahead and let's say const para document dot query selector and we are going to grab it by

135
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:42.150
the element selector and know what I'm going to do is I'm going to say Concertante log.

136
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:53.440
Piera darte, get attribute and get attribute, so which attribute of this paragraph do we want to get?

137
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.420
So this paragraph has only one attribute.

138
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:06.320
So it's attributes are the kind of key value pairs or sometimes only values which are specified in the

139
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.450
opening tag of any human element.

140
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.920
And they are attributes.

141
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.560
It doesn't matter what's their name.

142
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.660
They are attributes, so let's go ahead and let's select the attribute, OK, and in here, we just

143
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:26.480
passing the attribute name and it is going to give us the main para, which is the attribute, the ID

144
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.000
attribute name of this team element.

145
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:37.540
So this was the first method, the second method that I want to talk about is set attribute.

146
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:45.450
And this is when we recreate attributes for TEMEL elements through JavaScript.

147
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:52.680
This is why the in the in the previous lecture, I told you guys that for now, just think of dumb as

148
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.390
your entry point from JavaScript to the world of Estima and Cyesis, of course.

149
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.960
So these two are at methods, so just have to provide them with parentheses.

150
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.200
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab our PEMRA once more.

151
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.610
Well, I could just copy it from there and put it here and uncommented.

152
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.530
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to say para that set attribute.

153
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.050
What is the attribute that I want to give to this para the attribute let's say is a class.

154
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:31.650
And so the first argument is going to be the name of attribute and the second argument is going to be

155
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.740
paragraph is going to be the value for that attribute.

156
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.910
So let's save it.

157
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.240
And now if we come here.

158
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.270
So let's come.

159
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.260
Oops, not there in the elements, let's go into the body.

160
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.350
And this paragraph as you guys can see it here, it has a class as well.

161
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.400
So it has a class of paragraph, it does have a class of paragraph.

162
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.040
We can access it in the console as well.

163
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.330
For that we are going to say console does log.

164
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.960
And we are going to say para not get attribute.

165
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.970
And what does the attribute that we are going to get?

166
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.310
We are going to get the class and it is going to give us that cost.

167
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.810
And even if I add one, two, three, it is going to add one to three.

168
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.170
That's it for this lecture.

169
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.210
See you guys in the next one.
