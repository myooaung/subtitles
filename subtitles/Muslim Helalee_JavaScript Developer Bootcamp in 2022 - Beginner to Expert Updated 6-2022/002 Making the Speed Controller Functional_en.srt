1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,340
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to make this video controller function.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,560
All right, so first off, let's open up a live server and you're going to wait for it.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,120
So this is our video controller.

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,310
This is how it is originally looking.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,300
But we can see that the speed is not changing, so it is not functional.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,710
So the first thing that I want to grab is going to be CONSED.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,320
I want to grab our video element that has a class of video, I think.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,619
Yeah.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,480
So I'm going to say document that query selector and let's grab it by the class, which is video.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:53,290
Video, yep, better and next, let's go ahead and grab our speed container and we are going to you

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:53,620
know what?

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:00,070
We are just going to grab that copied and pasted here and the classes this time speed.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,640
And finally, we are going to grab our speed bar as well.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,050
And I'm just going to call it bar, so I'm going to call it bar.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,360
And in the class, we are going to add speed as well because the class speed bar.

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,580
So we are going to grab our speed.

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,320
And we are going to add an event listener to it now, the event that we are adding to it is a mouse

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,580
move event, which we have talked about a lot in our previous project, that whenever you move your

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,150
mouse, it doesn't matter if it is clicked or not.

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,090
If the mouse is down or up, it doesn't matter if you just move your mouse.

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:46,320
This event is going to fire and we are going to grab our event object and we are going to create a an

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,370
X variable.

23
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,360
And this variable is going to grab the distance in extraction that this speed controller travels.

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,580
So we know how we can get the distance.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:05,700
It is E, page, page X and we are going to subtract from this value the value of speed that offset

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,140
left.

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:15,060
And the reason that we offset left, the reason that we subtract it is because this speed is not actually

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,350
attached to this page.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,490
So there is there is some offset to this speed and this we need to subtract it because whenever I'm

30
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,340
here, I want the page X to be zero.

31
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,360
I don't want it to be like zero plus all the space.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,640
I just want it to be zero when I'm here.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,460
I want the page X to be, let's say, 600.

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,050
I don't want it to be 600 plus this value.

35
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,250
So we need to subtract it from that.

36
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:49,770
Next thing is, I'm going to create a percent value because according to this percentage, the speed

37
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,650
is going to increase or decrease and this percentage is actually taken into consideration.

38
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:04,060
This with so the percentage is related to the width of this container with off the speed bar as well.

39
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,850
So we are going to say X divided by which we were ever we are.

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,320
We are going to divide it by the speed that offset with offset width.

41
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,500
And you can find out more about offset left and with in the MDN.

42
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,470
I show you the offset I think I've shown in the offset left.

43
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,450
You can just type there and you can read more about them.

44
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,560
Now I'm going to grab and I'm going to create a minimum value, which is zero point one.

45
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,010
So our increment is going to be by point one.

46
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,360
So it's going to be zero point one, then zero point two and then the zero point three and then zero

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,990
point for all the way to five.

48
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,760
So the const maximum value is five for us.

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,590
All right, so the maximum is five.

50
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,290
We're going to use these variables, don't worry.

51
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,660
So now let's go ahead and let's create a dynamic with four hour playback.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,880
So for that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our percent.

53
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,760
And multiply it by 100.

54
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,060
All right, and I'm going to add a percentage sign to it, so it is going to give us the with.

55
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,510
So but this the problem with this is so if the page X is, let's say like two or one, the problem with

56
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,690
this is that are going to end up with decimal numbers.

57
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,460
So what do we have to do is we are going to go ahead and wrap this inside a method that is math dot

58
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,570
round, because we want to get the rounded numbers at all time.

59
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,910
We don't want to end up with decimal points.

60
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,100
We just want, like, whole integers.

61
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,990
Right.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,050
And finally, we are going to create the play back, write the playback rate and we are going to say

63
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:59,070
the playback rate is percent is our percent times our maximum value, minus minimum value plus the minimum

64
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,450
value.

65
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,480
Right.

66
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,180
So what does this mean if I were a person, let's say it's 10 percent.

67
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,930
All right, the width is going to be 10 percent, multiply by 100.

68
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,030
It is the width is going to be 1000.

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,900
Right.

70
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,650
And plus percent, it is going to be 1000 percent.

71
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,250
All right.

72
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,470
So then our percent, which is 10 percent, is it is going to come here.

73
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,940
So it is going to be 10.

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,760
Our maximum value, let's say it is one, our minimum value is zero point one.

75
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,380
OK, so one minus zero point one point nine nine.

76
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,760
So 10 multiply by point nine nine, we end up with nine point nine.

77
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,270
And when we add zero point nine to it, our playback rate is dynamically 10.

78
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,230
All right.

79
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,340
So our playback rate is dynamically the percentage that we have set it.

80
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,910
So we are going to say Baudot style now.

81
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,820
We are going to apply these styles that style.

82
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,450
That width should be what should be the playback.

83
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,420
Right.

84
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:14,800
So where is the playback rate darte to fixed right now, this to fixed it returns a string representing

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,520
a number in a fixed notation, number of digits.

86
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,370
OK, now a number of digits after the decimal point, it must be in range of zero point to inclusive.

87
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,890
It means that whenever we increase or decrease, we can only see two decimal points.

88
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,210
That's why we say it should be fixed to two decimal points.

89
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,750
And I'm going to put in two and and also we are going to add X to it.

90
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,700
And this adding extra.

91
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,710
It is actually this X that we have.

92
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,700
So if I come here, this X is added to it.

93
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,470
So the number is generated dynamically.

94
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,020
The X is added in line.

95
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,710
All right.

96
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:03,320
Hardcoded there and also I want to give you a resource if you want to read about the following property

97
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,620
and it is the playback rate, it is the An API digital media aliments API.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,990
And in there we have our playback rate.

99
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,640
You can read more about it there.

100
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,750
But basically what we want is we are going to grab our video and the playback rate that we have created

101
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:29,810
should be equal to the playback rate which is available to us by the API playback rate which is available

102
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,190
to us by the API.

103
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,740
So let's save it.

104
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's go ahead.

105
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,840
Let's come here.

106
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,860
And it doesn't work so well with that, with

107
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,780
OK, I think I've made a mistake here.

108
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,470
So the width should be equal to that with that we have here that we have specified there and we are

109
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,170
going to change the text content as well.

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,260
So the text content is going to change based on where we are with our mouse.

111
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,130
Right.

112
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,410
So we are going to say playback rate.

113
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,890
And in here I'm going to say to fixed.

114
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,840
Sorry for that mistake to fixed.

115
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,500
Come on, buddy.

116
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:24,200
And we are going to say to we are going to add not zero two and we are going to add the X, so the text

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,040
content is going to have a number generated dynamically and X is going to be tossed at the end of it.

118
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,890
And the bar with is going to be the way that we have calculated right here.

119
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,630
So we know what the width is.

120
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,820
So if the person to extend the width is going to be 10 percent of the entire with.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,380
So what is the entire with?

122
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,910
Where is it?

123
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,070
It's in here.

124
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,720
So the entire with is going to be twelve hundred, twelve hundred and ten percent of that is going to

125
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,640
be one to one.

126
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,520
Right.

127
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,350
And then based on that with the width of the bar is going to be that amount.

128
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,860
And also the text content of the bar is going to be the number which is produced dynamically based on

129
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,590
where we are in the width and we are going to add an extra in this playback rate is added for us dynamically.

130
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:14,890
All right.

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:24,320
So we are going to say I think this is the Web speech API that we should add here, and this is our

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,420
playback rate that we have created.

133
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,740
Yet now it works.

134
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,850
So if I move, you can see that not only the no updates but the with also updates and you don't need

135
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,230
to click or do anything.

136
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,100
So now let's go ahead to this, cause I'm super excited.

137
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,880
But still let me decrease this.

138
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,560
We can see that it doesn't work here now.

139
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,470
The speed is not increasing or decreasing.

140
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,040
So let's go ahead and check it out and the code.

141
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:06,280
And so everything looks fine here, and I think if we see here, it says play back, this R is capitalized,

142
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,300
so let's capitalize the R, save it and let's click on this.

143
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,690
Yeah, now it works.

144
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:21,540
So the problem was this, so if you were to go to the Mozilla developer website, if I just pasted and

145
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,850
if we go there, we can see that we should see that the playback rate, the rate is capitalized.

146
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,180
It is complicated.

147
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,570
All right.

148
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,880
I just forgot to cancel it and now it works.

149
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,150
So if I come here and if I play this.

150
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,190
It's fast.

151
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,760
So first things first, what does this call?

152
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,950
See this as Animation's.

153
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,430
All right, so this is going to be it for this chapter and this project, it was a relatively short

154
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:08,320
project, but it is something that is most often dropped out of wherever the websites.

155
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,650
They have a they have a video.

156
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,580
So if you have a website that has a video, you can go ahead and add a playback speed.

157
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,590
Of course, I've added it to five.

158
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,540
You can go all the way to ten.

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,160
I think that is the maximum.

160
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:27,710
So if we come to here, the idea is muted when the fast first slow motion outside the range for recommits.

161
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,750
So it is from zero point to five to five.

162
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,550
So that is going to be the range from zero point to five to five.

163
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,730
And you can add it to your websites.
