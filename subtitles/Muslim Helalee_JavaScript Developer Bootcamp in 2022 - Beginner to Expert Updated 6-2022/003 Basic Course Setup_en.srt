00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,430
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,620
In this lecture, I'm going to show you the necessary setup for this course.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,290
Now, I know that you have previous experience of achievement and success and you definitely have a

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,270
code editor of your choice, using that code editor is perfectly fine.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,910
That is OK, be that viscose, be that Atem Brackett's sublime text or even notepad, that is cool as

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,150
well.

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,370
I mean, if you're comfortable with it, then that is going to be OK.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:35,740
Right.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:44,350
But if you want to code along with me exactly the way I do, what I would want you to install is going

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,380
to be the visual studio code.

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,990
This is the in my opinion, of course, and this is highly subjective, the best code editor in the

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,410
world.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,010
Right.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,870
And you can install it by going to this website code, that visual studio dot com, and it is going

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:09,100
to probably detect your operating system and it is going to give you an option for downloading it on

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,210
your operating system.

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,800
Or you could just go ahead and choose it for whatever it is you're operating system.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,410
Once you have downloaded it, the installation process is fairly simple.

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,690
Just have to go ahead and breeze through it and that's going to be no problem.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,720
And then right after that, you can go ahead and open it up.

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,790
You're going to get a welcome page, which I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to close it.

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,130
On the left side, we have some tabs.

23
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,040
The first one is whenever you want to insert files and create files.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,430
Right.

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:50,470
And first stuff I want I'm going to walk you through some settings that I think are going to be beneficial

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:50,850
for you.

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,080
So go ahead to file the file tab from there to preferences and then settings.

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,110
And in here type font size, you can increase the font size.

29
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,430
For me, it's eighteen.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,450
You can increase it.

31
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,500
You can decrease it.

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:14,600
All right, and the next thing is now, whenever you have a line that is too long for the width of the

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:23,180
viscose window, you're going to see that there is actually like this a a horizontal scroll bar.

34
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,540
If you want to avoid that, you're just going to say word.

35
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:36,160
Rob, and just go ahead and grab the word Rob and say on and then whenever the line breaks at the page,

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,830
it is going to go to the next line.

37
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,560
Right.

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,780
So that's these settings.

39
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:48,070
And as far as the extensions are concerned for this fiasco that I'm using, I want you to install a

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:54,380
few of them that are necessary to to go along with me.

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,290
So the first one is going to be the code formatter, the prettier code formatter.

42
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,320
And you just you just have to come in here, search extensions in the marketplace just right.

43
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,060
PERTIERRA And you're going to see this.

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:13,690
And in here, you're instead of seeing the disable button, you're going to see something like install,

45
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,330
just click on it and it is going to install it.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,970
The next theme, the next extension that I want you to install is going to be the life server.

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,900
And this is used whenever you type something.

48
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:33,340
And when you save that the changes, you're going to see the changes on the Web page in real time.

49
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,840
The next one is going to be JavaScript code snippets instead of that as well.

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,820
And finally, install the bracket PAKKALA Ricer.

51
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,360
Now, before actually wrapping this lecture up, I would like to show you some extensions.

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,470
And these extensions are actually Vrsaljko themes.

53
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,550
I've got a bunch of them, and throughout this course, I will be changing, I think, to to maybe like

54
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:08,470
a couple of times, like I would like to change stuff up, you know, to make sure that things they

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,670
stay interesting.

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,340
Right.

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:20,500
So at first you're probably going to see the the original and the default theme for the voice code.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,560
You can go ahead and search for any theme that you want.

59
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:33,060
But towards the end of this course, I will be using the one dark pro theme which I recently found and

60
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,320
which is really, really, really awesome.

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,010
And I do have another awesome theme as well, and that is Dracula.

62
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:47,800
So if you just go ahead and search for Dracula and depending on your Internet connection, it is going

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,750
to pop up very, very soon.

64
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,130
And it says that I don't have an Internet connection, even though I do.

65
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,940
That's why it doesn't show it.

66
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,670
So it's Dracula and I'm going to show it to you guys here.

67
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,350
I do have it installed.

68
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,410
There it is.

69
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,480
This is Dracula official.

70
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,750
You can go ahead and install this as well.

71
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,520
And I think that's it for this lecture.

72
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:19,240
See you guys in the next chapter, where will we will start talking about JavaScript for real.

73
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,240
So let's get coding.
