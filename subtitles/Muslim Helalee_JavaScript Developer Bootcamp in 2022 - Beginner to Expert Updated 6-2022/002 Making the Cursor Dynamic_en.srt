00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,670
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:07,360
In this lecture, we are going to implement the functionality of our cursor effect.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,680
All right, so inside the JavaScript file, we have nothing.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,200
So first off, what I'm going to do is I want to grab this this circle.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,090
If I reloaded the circle that we have on the top left corner.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,330
So I'm going to say const I'm going to call it mouse cursor.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,190
Notice the camel case, right?

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,340
We have document query selector.

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:39,190
We are going to select our elements like using query selector and query selector all like all the time.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,150
And what is the class name for that?

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,130
We are going to select it through the class name.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,740
And now what I want to do is I want to grab our allies as well, because this effect actually happens

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,490
on the allies.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,770
As far as the Sepah effect is concerned, we have accomplished that in the success.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,990
But in the JavaScript, I just want it to be applied on the allies.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,270
You can do it on anything else.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,100
I'm just giving you like a world of possibilities here.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:14,290
And I'm going to call this variable NAV links and we are going to say document inside this HTML document

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,810
through the query selector method, grab all the allies.

20
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,490
We don't want to make this mistake again.

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:21,850
Right.

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,240
And what how can we grab them?

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:32,320
We're going to say enough links, this is the class name for their parents and there we are going to

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
say a lot.

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,950
So inside the quotations is the realm of any success, Violencia says Selecter.

26
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:47,990
So this is a valid Cyesis descendants selector because space is a descendant Combinator Selecter.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,940
All right.

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,430
So what do we want to do?

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,630
We want to add a reveal listener on whenever the mouse moves.

30
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,870
So what is it actually that we want to add this event on?

31
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:06,310
So when the mouse moves, if I come here, so when the mouse moves inside the window, wherever we want

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:14,020
to add that effect, we want whenever we move our mouse around and like this one, we don't see anything.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,350
We want this circle to be moved around with it.

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,770
So we are going to grab the window, which is the global object, and we are going to say an event listener.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,970
What is what is it that we are looking for or what is it to be accurate?

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,270
We are listening for a for a mouse move now.

37
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,810
Whenever the mouse has moved, it doesn't matter whether the mouse is moving over something or moving

38
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,830
out of something.

39
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:49,440
Right now, we haven't we haven't talked about the mouse move because we have a lot of events and that's

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,080
why I've just covered a few in the three chapters, because we have a ton of projects.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,370
We are going to cover the rest of the important stuff in those projects.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:06,870
OK, so instead of covering them all in the theory and then in the projects as well, I just gave you

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,050
the idea and now we are covering move.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,140
So think of the mouse move as the key press event that we have talked about.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,780
So key for us doesn't care if the key is pressed down or up, it just cares about the key is press.

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,110
That's.

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,490
So Mouse Move does not care about whether the mouse is moving over something or moving out of something.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,500
As long as the mouse is moved, this function is going to run and we are going to run a function.

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,690
OK, now this this way.

50
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,800
We have not added any event listener.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,540
All right.

52
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,690
And I'm going to I'm going to I've done this because I want to show you we can add functions for our

53
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,760
event listeners in other ways as well.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,750
Now, this cursor is a function actually we have called the function here, but we have not created

55
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,530
the function yet.

56
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,970
So we are just going to say, cursor, OK, what what is that cursor?

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,170
And this is the cursor function.

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,010
So whenever we create the function here and when the user moves their mouse, the function is going

59
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,670
to be called.

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,620
Now, this is a second way of creating a development centers functions.

61
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,010
You just called the function and just create a standalone function.

62
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:28,600
So in that case, we had function expressions or in both cases this is going to be a callback function.

63
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,090
But in this case, we had a function expression.

64
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,590
This is a function declaration.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,810
Right.

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,520
So in here, what we are looking for is an event object.

67
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,990
So this function again, I just want to mention this is what the difference between this function and

68
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,620
the function that we used in our previous event listeners is nothing.

69
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,420
You can do it both ways.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,740
We usually do it this way when we have more lines of code.

71
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,440
We do not want to clutter our event listener.

72
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,570
We want our listener to be here.

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,320
And maybe the function is way down here somewhere.

74
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,910
This is just an example, right?

75
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,540
So let's go ahead and let's consider log our event object, which we have covered before.

76
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,360
And if I go to the concert log and if I come here.

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,170
So now you guys can see each time I move the mouse, you're going to see that I'm going to bring this

78
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,220
up and I'm going to zoom.

79
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:29,020
And so this screen X, screen Y client, client, client, X client, why it is going to give us the

80
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,940
mouse event.

81
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,110
All right.

82
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,070
And all of them are going to change.

83
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,190
But what we are looking for is page X and page Y.

84
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,530
So if I, if we go there.

85
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,620
So if I, if I just move, everything changes.

86
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,480
All right.

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,870
So now you guys can see where all these numbers, they're changing.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,200
The reason for that is our cursor is actually moving around.

89
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,000
All right.

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,920
So what I want to do is I want to grab the page X and the page.

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:05,160
What they are going to give us the exact location where this where these links they are situated.

92
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,530
Right.

93
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:13,930
So this is the target that we are going to get and we are going to say mouse cursor, dot style, dot

94
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,590
top.

95
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,580
Oops.

96
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,270
I don't know why I get that every time I touch I type style.

97
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:30,670
So we are going to grab the E page X, the page Y for the top because top is from top to bottom and

98
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:36,220
it is in the right direction and we are going to add to it a pixel string.

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,240
All right.

100
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:46,060
We have just successfully selected the Y variable sorry, divide, divide, coordinate for the event

101
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,580
object and we have given that to the top property for this mouse cursor.

102
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,360
So so now we can see that we can move in the top and bottom direction.

103
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,610
So now you can see.

104
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,770
But I cannot move around like from one side to the next set because the left is still remaining.

105
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,120
All right.

106
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,340
So now you guys can see the circle is moving.

107
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:13,900
So now let's go ahead and let's add the X to the left, because X moves from one side to the other and

108
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,040
X is the.

109
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,230
The one side to the other coordinate.

110
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:29,180
So now you guys can see we do have our earth, now the cursor has what what is this style for the cursor?

111
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:36,200
The style for the cursor, which is the circle comes from the coordinates for the event object.

112
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,380
It's that simple.

113
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,360
So the cursor had only a style of a circle.

114
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:51,560
So this circle grabs its coordinates from the event object and the event object shows exactly the coordinates

115
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,870
of the cursor that we have.

116
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:01,550
So if I go ahead and if I come to the body and if I say cursor and if I just come and the cursor not

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,940
and now you guys can see whenever we move a recursive, the circle behind it is going to move.

118
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,490
And if I just go ahead and comment and these two lines as well and coming back in this, I should have

119
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,750
probably done this.

120
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,880
So now if I move now you can see wherever I go, these numbers are going to change.

121
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,980
So right in here.

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,750
Right.

123
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,770
And there we should see.

124
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,500
Let's go ahead and check out the page X and the page you saw in the X.

125
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,480
We are 01 in the whyever, too.

126
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,049
So basically, we are grabbing the OK, that was the offset.

127
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,780
Sorry, but still the page X Y are the same.

128
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:48,300
All right, so we are grabbing the coordinates of the the cursor coordinates of this cursor and we give

129
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,800
it to the mouse cursor, those coordinates, and so the mouse cursor can move along wherever we go.

130
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,940
It does have a little lag.

131
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,060
I think that's because I'm recording on your screens.

132
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,310
It might not have this lag, but it's not that noticeable.

133
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,100
So we should be cool, right.

134
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,540
So let's come and talk this one again, and we are going to comment out over this one as well.

135
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,130
So now for the final piece of the project, what we are going to do is we are going to grab our links

136
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,430
because now we want to add that's that beautiful effect whenever we hover on those links.

137
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,260
But now, again, the question arises, we have three links.

138
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:39,000
Do we want to add event listeners for each of them individually or do we want to loop over them?

139
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,790
Which one is better?

140
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,930
So we want to loop over them and we are going to say for each.

141
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,030
And we are not going to do any aerial functions, we are just going to do our simple function and to

142
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,180
each the parameter is going to be the link.

143
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,990
And this link is actually a loop variable, which is going to grab the value from home, the value of

144
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,200
the service and then the value of the contact.

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,680
And whenever this for loop runs, what I want to do, I want to go ahead and I want to grab the link,

146
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,820
which is the loop variable.

147
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,770
And I want to add the event listener, because this link is at the end of the day, is going to have

148
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:24,780
three values or as many values as they as we have as many values as the number of links that we have.

149
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,210
So for those, what I'm going to do is I'm going to add an event listener in the event we are going

150
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,460
to listen for a mouse out.

151
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,180
All right.

152
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,450
OK, so when the mouse is out, we want to run a function and what is the function going to do?

153
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,360
The function is going to grab our mouse cursor.

154
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,660
And it is going to it is going to add a class to it.

155
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,400
At a.

156
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,450
So what is the class, the classes, link, dash, grow.

157
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,420
Though, let's save it, let's move over, we don't.

158
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:09,250
OK, so now it says I'm going to reload it when I hover on top of the lake, when I hover away, of

159
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,660
course, this is mouse out.

160
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,680
When we hover away from the link, we are going to see that effect.

161
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,230
So when I'm on the left, when I hover away, we are going to see that right.

162
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,750
But this is not actually the effect that we want.

163
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,070
Whenever we hover away, we want to remove that.

164
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,970
So let's go ahead and let's say remove.

165
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,970
We want to remove the link.

166
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,210
Right.

167
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,330
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to add another event.

168
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,870
Lessiter.

169
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,970
And you're going to see an event listener and we are going to listen for what?

170
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,310
We are going to listen for a mouse over.

171
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,670
And when the mouse is over that element, we want to run a function.

172
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,090
And what does that function?

173
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,190
Basically, I'm just going to grab it and I'm going to pasted here and I'm going to sit at it, save

174
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,360
it.

175
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,870
So now, whenever we are on the link that the this is going to increase in size our cursor and when

176
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,570
we are away, it's going to decrease, increase, decrease, increase, decrease.

177
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,620
All right.

178
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,530
But there are a few problems there.

179
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,060
We can't see our text.

180
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,930
The text is white and let's see what else.

181
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,770
So the text should be black and we still have our border.

182
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,100
And I think we should remove the border as well.

183
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:28,300
So in here, let's go ahead and let's add another class to our and we are going to say class, let's

184
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,150
start at what is the class that we want to add.

185
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,180
Here is the Harvard ed and case.

186
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,420
Let me check it out.

187
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,020
So this is the class that we want to add.

188
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,720
And in this class is just this color block.

189
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:51,190
So if I hover on it and if I save it, oops, we should remove it in here because this is the removed

190
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:58,020
part and mouth out is the remove and mouseover is the ad part.

191
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,360
So if I hover on it it's going to go black.

192
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,150
And in case you're wondering if I just go ahead and come and tell this part, if we go on, it's OK.

193
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,360
But if we hover away, everything is going to stay the same because Mouse Out has been commented out.

194
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,760
That's why we add whenever you want to add it, you should remove it as well.

195
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,870
So added, remove, add, remove, add, remove.

196
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:31,200
All right, and with this, our project comes to an end, and that's it for this project, and I hope

197
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
you have enjoyed it and that's it for this chapter as well.

198
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,960
See you guys in the next one.
