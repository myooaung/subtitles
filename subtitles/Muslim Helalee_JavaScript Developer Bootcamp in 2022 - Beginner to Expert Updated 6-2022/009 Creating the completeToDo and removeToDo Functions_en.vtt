00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.580
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are definitely going to create the complete to do and remove to

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.450
do functions.

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.100
OK, so I'm going to come on top in here and I'm going to create a comment and I'm going to say when

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.080
a two do is completed and when is that when?

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.870
When is it to do completed it to do is completed whenever the user clicks on this icon.

6
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.480
Now this to do is completed.

7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.940
When is the tattoo removed?

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.160
Whenever the user clicks on this icon.

9
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.410
So let's implement those functions, create those functions to implement the functionality.

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.570
So I'm going to create a function.

11
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.000
We have already created the function name, the function name is the completed.

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.480
It should be inside this complete to do inside the Intellisense, which there is and we are going to

13
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.620
pass to do.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.730
I add him as the parameter because as the argument we have passed and the to do item, OK, and now

15
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.860
let's create that function.

16
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.530
The first thing that I want to do with this to do item.

17
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.290
So whenever the user clicks on the complete icon, what do we want to do.

18
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.950
We are going to grab the to do item and we are going to go into the class list and we are going to toggle

19
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.180
toggle what.

20
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.650
You guessed it right.

21
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.890
Toggle the check b10.

22
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.970
OK, so let's save it.

23
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.510
Let's come here and let's see if we can.

24
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.210
Hi.

25
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.710
So if I click on it, we are going to see that this the the this is green, right?

26
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.570
It means that something has happened.

27
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.110
And if I uncheck and it was not untuk if I click again, it is going to remove that green.

28
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.890
Where does that green coming.

29
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.010
Where is it coming from.

30
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.050
It is coming from, from right here.

31
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.340
So we have said that the color should be green.

32
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.870
That's it.

33
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.410
So we have successfully toggled the the one part of our think that we want to do so.

34
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.810
The one part of this problem is solved.

35
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.230
We have been able to toggle the check button, OK?

36
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.370
But there is another thing that we need to tackle as well, so whenever we want to, so this is the

37
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.950
check button and this is the uncheck.

38
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.040
Whenever we click on that button, if it has a class of check BTN, it is going to remove it.

39
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.010
And if it doesn't have, it is added, we are going to do the same thing with the uncheck button as

40
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.320
well.

41
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.600
So let's save it.

42
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.660
If it has a class of uncheck, remove it.

43
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.010
If it doesn't have a class of UNCAC at it, this is what Tuggle does.

44
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.810
It is on and off.

45
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.290
All right.

46
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.690
So now let's go say hi.

47
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.040
Click on it.

48
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.520
Now we can see that it didn't have a class of check and it didn't have a class of uncheck.

49
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.530
So it added both of the classes.

50
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.630
And if I click again now and it had a class of check and it had a class of uncheck, that's why it removed

51
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.220
both of them.

52
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.310
So whenever you are Tuggle, you don't need to really worry about whether this whether it has a class

53
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.030
or not.

54
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.910
OK, so that is done.

55
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.250
The next thing that we want to do is whenever we click on it, we want to see that line through on our

56
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.820
text.

57
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.930
So we are going to go grab our to do item.

58
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.170
We are going to go into the parent parent node.

59
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.040
It means that we have just selected the parent of this to do item.

60
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.510
So the parent of these to do items is we have created it right here.

61
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.200
It is the ALLAI because why do we want to do this?

62
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.010
It is the reason for that is we we are we are here.

63
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.760
All right.

64
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.400
And we want to go up one step.

65
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.490
So from there we can select the paragraph.

66
00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.350
All right, so I want to selected through this panel and from there we are going to search for it through

67
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.780
our query selector method and we are going to grab any element that has a class of text.

68
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.590
And we know that only our paragraph has a class of text.

69
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.340
So we have selected our paragraph successfully so far.

70
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.380
That's why we move up one step and then from the top we selected through our query selector.

71
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.080
Right.

72
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.690
And whenever when we selected, we are going to add a class to it.

73
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.030
But the class is not going to be added nor remove.

74
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.800
The class is going to be toggled.

75
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.100
So we are going to say, Tuggle, what is that class.

76
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.260
It is text line through.

77
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.190
So so let's say hi there.

78
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.590
Let's save it so now we can see that we are basically toggling three classes.

79
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.730
The first classes check B10 and at this stage, tech B10 is off.

80
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.820
So we need to turn it on.

81
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.420
The second class is unchecked between the unchecked, bitin is off.

82
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.970
So we need to turn it on.

83
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.700
And the third class is the line through the line through as off.

84
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.860
We need to turn them on.

85
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.880
So if I click on this, all three classes, they are turned on, all three classes are turned off.

86
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.790
That was fun.

87
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.080
All right.

88
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.660
So that's done, right.

89
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.130
The next thing that I want to do here is.

90
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.430
I want to toggled that true and false for for this ad to do as well.

91
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.250
OK, I want to toggle it to true or false as well.

92
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.270
So let's go ahead and let's grab our to do container.

93
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.540
This is the empty array that we have initialized right here, which we are going to change later, of

94
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.210
course, for our local storage.

95
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.850
And we are going to say to do item.

96
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.380
Come on, buddy.

97
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.450
To do item, OK, dot IED.

98
00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.480
So because this to do item is actually inside this to do container, we're going to grab the idea and

99
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.020
we are going to see if it is done now.

100
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.580
Now, this is the Dunn state.

101
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.630
You know what?

102
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.190
I'm going to do it in a different way.

103
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.910
So it is not confusing at all.

104
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:20.490
So we are going to say if this to do item which has a certain I.D. is done, if it is done, we are

105
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.050
going to return false.

106
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.840
If it is not done, we are going to return.

107
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.260
True.

108
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.970
OK, so when it is done, we are going to return false.

109
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.900
If it is not done, we are going to return.

110
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.230
True.

111
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.170
And we are going to save the result of this.

112
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:44.280
Turn the operator into and into another variable, which is this one into into this which, which we

113
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.790
have completed, which we have created before.

114
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.590
And this is the to do container.

115
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.090
Right.

116
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.790
So now we are done with our complete to do function.

117
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.340
Let's go ahead and let's create the when.

118
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.300
A to do is removed.

119
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.320
OK, so in here, this dysfunction is going to be relatively easy.

120
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.290
So we are going to create a function, the function name is going to be removed to do and we are going

121
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.080
to pass in our parameter of to do items.

122
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.030
So what we are going to do is whenever we click on the trash icon.

123
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:27.010
We want to remove that that do completely and whenever we say we want to remove that, to do it means

124
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.900
that we want to remove the ally.

125
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.170
So we are going to grab the to do item.

126
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.010
What is the parent of that?

127
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.280
The parent of the to do item is the elai.

128
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.490
And what is the parent of the elai?

129
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:47.700
It is going to be the USA and and the other we are going to say remove child and the USA.

130
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.640
And when the USA removes a child what is that child.

131
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.550
That child as the to do item.

132
00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.050
To do items parent, all right, it is going to remove it.

133
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.340
And here is where the trash is going to be set to true.

134
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.890
Here is where the trash is going to be set.

135
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.450
So we are going to say to do container, we are going to update our to do container as well.

136
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:21.340
That's why whenever we do something with the container, we can see it inside our local storage because

137
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.030
we're updating our to do container accordingly.

138
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:33.400
So we are going to say to the item that ID trash equals true because trash was false.

139
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.690
Right.

140
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:41.740
And when the trash is true, if you remember from our very first function, which is to do if the trash

141
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.380
is true, this function is going to return, it means none of this code is going to run.

142
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.500
So let's save it.

143
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.580
Let's check it out.

144
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.310
Hi there.

145
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.030
This is a to do so.

146
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.120
If I click on this, we can see it works perfectly fine.

147
00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.130
If I click on the trash, it is going to remove it completely and we don't see it anywhere.

148
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:10.120
It's it's not even inside this local storage because we have not yet persisted it to the local storage.

149
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.060
We should do that.

150
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.790
OK, we're going to do that in our final lectures in this chapter.

151
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:15.480
Right.

152
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.910
That that's going to be the final thing that we would do.

153
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.510
All right.

154
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.730
So I hope nothing is confusing.

155
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.890
And you know what?

156
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.750
I'm just going to cancel something for you, so you know exactly what I mean.

157
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.530
So to do item dot parent, we know what to do.

158
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.540
Item is right.

159
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.150
So what is the paranoid of this to do item.

160
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.090
So if I do that and if I say hi there and if I click on this, we are going to get Elai right.

161
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.090
So the parent node of this to do item is Elize.

162
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.720
So the result of this is going to be elai.

163
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.100
What about this?

164
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.920
And I'm sure you know that I'm not you know what, I'm not going to do it.

165
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:57.990
It's very simple.

166
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:05.020
So the concept, whenever we say paranoid, we are going to get lie and the parent of the ally is going

167
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.250
to be you.

168
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.030
Well, and from there, we are going to say remove child.

169
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:10.740
Right?

170
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.940
So I'm just going to remove this.

171
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.630
And now we have successfully implemented this.

172
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.150
I think our application is completed.

173
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:28.090
And if we weren't if we weren't going to add it sorry, persisted to the local storage, then our application

174
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.530
would be completed because it says hi there and we can see we can click on this.

175
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.370
It is going to add it.

176
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:40.270
We can check it, uncheck it, we can remove it and we can add it once more misspelled.

177
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.220
But the problem with not having the local storage is whenever when I reload, everything goes away.

178
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:52.080
So these this functionality, we are going to add in like in two or three letters, because I don't

179
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.720
I do not want to provide you with a lot of information in one lecture.

180
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.380
I do not want to scare you away.

181
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.500
This is going to be our very first interaction with the local storage.

182
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.300
And I promise you, I'm going to explain every nut on board of it.

183
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.680
That's it for this lecture.

184
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.160
See you guys in the next one.
