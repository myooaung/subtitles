00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,100
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to go over the matching part five.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:16,720
All right, so in the previous lecture, we ended at matching all the letters and numbers and also the

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,310
underscore, but now we are going to go over the matching, not all the letters numbers and underscore.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,570
So we are going to match which what is not a letter, a number and the underscore.

5
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,400
So let's go ahead and let's create our regex.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,350
So we are going to Raj a 17 X now.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,450
What should we put in here now?

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:46,660
In the previous lecture we put a lowercase W to match all the letters.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,090
Numbers underscore this time we are going to put an uppercase.

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,960
That's why I told you that you have to make sure that it is a lowercase this time it is going to be

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,710
the uppercase.

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,800
So the uppercase W matches.

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,900
It's Kopit, that's oh, he did copy matches everything that is not A through Z and zero through nine

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,810
and underscore.

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:21,000
So let's create our search and we are going to say search 17 result.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,750
And we are going to say that we want to grab our sentence and we want to match it with what?

17
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:37,130
With this regular expression number 17 and we want to talk to the console, the results.

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,090
So we are going to say search 17 results.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,900
And if I save it now, you can see it matched everything except the letters, the numbers and the underscore.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,100
So we have an underscore.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,120
We don't see it here.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,990
We have numbers.

23
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,710
We have letters.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,030
But you only have.

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,810
So I accept that anything except that.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,110
So the space says this at the percentage, the ampersand, whatever there is, if that's not a number,

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,880
a letter and underscore it is going to match it.

28
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,660
So so this is an example.

29
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,570
Number 17, let's dive into the example.

30
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,520
Number 18 now the in the example number 18, we are just going to go ahead and match all the numbers

31
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,890
so that 18.

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:34,680
X be equal to so how can we match excuse me, all the numbers, just the numbers, nothing else.

33
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,300
We don't care about the.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,340
We don't care about the symbols and the characters and the like, the letters, nothing, we just care

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,170
about the numbers.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,040
Now before going there, I'm just going to come in this one out and I'm going to you know what?

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm going to come in this result and this.

38
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,070
So let's just grab it and come into the back end of that part of this comment and I want to comment

39
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,090
this one out, we can get the property length as well.

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,900
So the length is 48.

41
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,210
I just wanted to show you this length as well, because we are going to use it below as well.

42
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,070
So now let's come in this one out.

43
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,010
All right.

44
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,130
So in here, we just we are just going to go ahead and provide aid.

45
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,170
That's it.

46
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,790
So when you provide a lower case, D. it is going to match all the numbers.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,220
If you provide an uppercase D, it is going to match not all the numbers.

48
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,620
So or it is going to match all non numbers, all numbers.

49
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,030
All non numbers.

50
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,900
OK, so I should provide I should grab this.

51
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,000
I should say non ladder's.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,680
I should say, not numbers and not underscore.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,290
Right, so nonono not a right, let's copy these three and let's put them right here.

54
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:12,200
Copy this for there and change the search results 17 to search results 18.

55
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,200
That's comment out the length first.

56
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,880
So we just get the numbers.

57
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,360
That's it.

58
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,610
So the numbers are from zero to nine so it just provides the numbers.

59
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:29,170
But if I were to comment that out and grab the length, so there are 22 digits inside this string.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,620
So that's what basically the length is going to give us.

61
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:42,230
Now, moving on to example, number eight, number 19 as we want to match all nine numbers.

62
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:42,920
Right.

63
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,870
So match all numbers.

64
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,420
So for matching all numbers, basically, we have the same thing here.

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,390
The only difference says and you guess you're right, we are going to pass in a capital city.

66
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,450
Right.

67
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:03,040
And we are going to change all 18 to 19 and save it.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,200
So it matches everything.

69
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,000
That is not a number.

70
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,970
So you can see that it has grabbed the symbols.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,810
It has grabbed the letters, uppercase, lowercase space, whatever, as long as it is not in number

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,030
and we can get the length as well.

73
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,590
The length is 100 Arri.

74
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,170
So this is example number 19.

75
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,040
We are going to go ahead and we are going to talk about example number 20, and this is going to be

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,720
the last example that I cover in this lecture, and it is matching all the white space.

77
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,900
Now, the white space could be space.

78
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,750
Could we enter, could be tapped, could be whatever.

79
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,050
As long as it is white space, we can grab it.

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,860
Right.

81
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,400
And now I'm sure you are getting to know what these are.

82
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,550
So we are now this is what we are looking for.

83
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,290
This is what we are going to discuss.

84
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,410
It is grabbing all the white space, not all the white space.

85
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:07,010
We have talked about the deep, lower case, upper case, lower case and upper case.

86
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,570
So we are getting around.

87
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,040
Right.

88
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,090
So let's create our regular expression.

89
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:21,200
It is rejects 20 X and how can we match all the whitespace?

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,460
We just provide s that set and we want to grab all.

91
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,620
We want to print all of it.

92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,160
That's why we provide the G.

93
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,530
We want to grab globally all of them.

94
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,400
Right.

95
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,830
So we can go ahead and copy these and put them right here.

96
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,640
And that's uncommon this.

97
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,140
Uncommon this.

98
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,320
And I'm going to grab this 19 oops.

99
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:52,040
I'm going to grab the 19 and I'm going to throw that, I'm going to select everything, save it.

100
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,280
And now you can see that we have grabbed all the white space.

101
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,150
I know.

102
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:04,130
Like if I had tab there ahead to enter, it is going to throw an error, like it's another line.

103
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:13,850
So it's if I put multiple tabs and if I save it, we selected that multiple terms, like, let's put

104
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,870
it at this start.

105
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,750
Yeah, it is going to just provide because all of them, they are basically just one space, so it is

106
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,230
going to grab all the white space, see?

107
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,860
So now let's go ahead and remove all the tabs there.

108
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,480
So.

109
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,180
So this is what it is going to give us.

110
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,020
It is going to give us all the white space, the white space, be the white space being created by space,

111
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,450
enter whatever.

112
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,280
Right.

113
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,060
So that's it for this lecture.

114
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,820
See you guys in the next one.
