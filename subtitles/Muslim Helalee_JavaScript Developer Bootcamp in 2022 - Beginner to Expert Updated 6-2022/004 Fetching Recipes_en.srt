1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,900
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to fetch recipe's.

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,340
All right, so first off, let's see what it is that we want to grab.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,760
We want to grab this entire form which which wraps around this input, then we are going to grab the

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,630
input, the form, because we are going to add a fourth event, which is submit and then the input because

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,370
we need the value from the input and then we are going to grab a wrapper.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,510
So.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:39,040
And then we are also going to grab our search results, all right, so that's what we are going to do.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,790
So first off, let's go let's go ahead and say CONSED.

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:52,380
Uh huh, I'm going to I'm going to say search input, so this is going to be our search input and I'm

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,550
going to say document dot, query selector.

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,600
Right.

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,140
So we have document that query selector.

13
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,460
What is the class for that?

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,650
What is the class, its search input, very generic.

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,160
So let's put it there.

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,880
And the next one is going to be search result.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,270
So I'm just going to swap this with result and I think we changed it to results.

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,000
So I'm just going to call it results.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:36,090
And the next thing that I want to grab is going to be const form document, query selector.

20
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,600
And I'm just going to say for right, so now let's go ahead and let's grab our form and we're going

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,930
to add a listener on Samat.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:58,720
And when we submitted let's grab the event object and when we grab the object, first thing's first,

23
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:05,120
let's prevent the default behavior, which is to reload the page, submit and reload the page.

24
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:11,920
The next step is going to be what I want to do is I want to grab the value from that search and put

25
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,420
so search in.

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm going to say search query and OK, so we have search query.

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,400
Let's grab our research inputs of search input, data value, and then what I want to do is not not

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,830
not not value, just start value.

29
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,300
What I want to do is, oh, come on, math.

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,540
What I want to do is I want to call the fetch recipes for recipes function.

31
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,580
And I want to put in our search query, not searching, but search query.

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,630
Right.

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,770
So now that that is out of the way, let's create our function.

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,730
So we are going to say function and it is fetch recipes, so fetch recipes.

35
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:16,740
And we have our search query right here and now.

36
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,200
So we are going to say const.

37
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,090
Like always response a weight fetch.

38
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,950
So how is this going to work?

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,140
We know how this is going to work.

40
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,490
We we have already seen that if I come up here.

41
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,840
So first off, we need to pass and this htp, this request and then the query and then app ID and then.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,810
So there are four things that we need to pass.

43
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,140
The first thing is this, and then we have our search query I.D. And so instead of using that, let's

44
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,010
put it back ticks here and I'm going to say so first off, we are going to say a recipe.

45
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,580
You are.

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,900
And right after recipe, you are out.

47
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,420
We are going to put our search query right after that.

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,570
What I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our.

49
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,950
Right after that, let's see what else is in the between.

50
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,550
So we have an ampersand we have in here after a search query, we have an M percent.

51
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,160
So this is a search query.

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,550
So I'm just going to provide an ampersand here and then dollar sign and our curly braces.

53
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,810
And we do have one and percent right after app I.D. So let's copy this.

54
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,780
Let's provide it right here.

55
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,450
And so the first one, what is this?

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,710
The first one is going to be your app I.D. and then we have application key.

57
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:59,650
So I'm going to say app I.D. I.D. and then we have our app key.

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,310
Perfect.

59
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,700
So this response is now completed.

60
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,240
We can safely say CONSED response.

61
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,920
Data and we can sit await response, response.

62
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,060
Jason.

63
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:29,700
All right, so response that, Jason, and we should safely be able to log in to the console.

64
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,440
Hopefully there is no problem there.

65
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,470
And let's come here, let's open up the console.

66
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,540
Let's go there.

67
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,490
Let's say Sarlat enter and we get all these kind of errors.

68
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:54,840
All right, so have we done everything correctly, so this is our search query, right?

69
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:04,030
So we have our QE there and then we have provided recipe you, Earl, and after the recipe URL, we

70
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,850
have our search query and.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,100
Let's let's pass in our response.

72
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,300
Let's take a look at the response, what is the problem with the response?

73
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:27,210
And fetch recipe search query comes from searching for that value and everything should be working correctly.

74
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,880
So let's say Sarlat.

75
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,220
Access to fetch from Origin has been blocked by Schaus policy.

76
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:45,840
And if anything, a response was set felt to fetch 21, so from line 21, we were found to fetch.

77
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's see.

78
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,550
So we have a recipe.

79
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,120
You are right here, which is this and right after that.

80
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,130
And what if I just go ahead and insert these in here?

81
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,460
So if I inserted there so this is going to be our search query.

82
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,280
And right after the search query, where is our search query question?

83
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:18,780
Sine we have an ampersand, so we have our ampersand and then we have app I.D., which is right here.

84
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,400
Your app I.D., so, oh, we should write the app ID word itself.

85
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,690
Oh, that that's the problem there.

86
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,550
So when I do this, you should write it and then you should write the app key word itself as well.

87
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,200
So we just passed and the values, that's why the we got that error.

88
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:54,190
So I think we should be able to grab our you are all now so recipe you URL and let's save it.

89
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,230
So are we good.

90
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,430
Are we good.

91
00:07:59,450 --> 00:07:59,940
I don't know.

92
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,710
Let's check it out.

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,770
Yep, we are good.

94
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:11,940
So this is a response, response was a status of 200, so it's OK.

95
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,920
So now let's grab our response data.

96
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,030
Let's save it and let's say Sagada.

97
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:30,090
We get solid, we get hits 10 because we didn't define to what so far for us to be able to define to

98
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,900
what, and you need to just keep in mind that just add another 10 percent and say two equal to 30.

99
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,110
Just add it and we should get 30 hits.

100
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:48,030
And this is 30 heads right there, so we do get our 30 heads inside each of the heads.

101
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,450
We have a recipe.

102
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,130
You are we inside the recipe?

103
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,540
We have the calories which we are going to get.

104
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,180
We have the diet level.

105
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,800
It doesn't have any depth level.

106
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,680
It does have some health labels.

107
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,200
And this is the ingredients.

108
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,300
Now, this is why I'm telling you, this is massive.

109
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,890
You can log in here the ingredients as well.

110
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,610
For example, I'm not going to do it because whenever you want to read about it, you just save your

111
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,180
recipe and then you can take a look at the ingredients.

112
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,440
This is the label which we are going to grab, and this is the URL which you are going to grab as well.

113
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,770
BBC Good Food.

114
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:35,460
All right, so now let's do something meaningful with this data, and you know what, I'm just going

115
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,340
to postpone that to the next lecture.

116
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,210
However, I'm going to create the function here.

117
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,700
Right.

118
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,040
And the function is going to be.

119
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,870
You know what, I'm just going to do hits, let's see what do we get?

120
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,670
So let's say it's it's funny.

121
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,510
OK, so here we get 30 hits, right?

122
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:11,160
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass this heads inside a function called display recipe display

123
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:20,980
recipes, and we are going to create that function, display recipes, and we are going to pass in recipe

124
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,610
results.

125
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,980
Recipe results.

126
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,190
All right.

127
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,080
So that's it for this lecture in the next election.

128
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,070
We're going to display our recipes to the UI.
