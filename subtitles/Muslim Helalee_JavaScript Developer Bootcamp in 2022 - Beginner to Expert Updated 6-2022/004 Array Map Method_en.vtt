Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.900
In this lecture, we are going to talk about the array map method.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.220
All right, so the map method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.680
on every element in the calling array, right.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.300
So, for example, we have an array here, and this is an array of artists and songs objects.

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370
So there are four items in here.

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.760
What we are going to do is we want to grab all the artists out of these objects, which are actually

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.920
the array items.

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.280
Right.

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.240
So what are we to do is first off, we are going to call the best songs array and we are going to call

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.730
the map method on it.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.490
Right.

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.380
And this map method is going to accept a callback function.

14
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.100
Right.

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.360
Which I am going to create the callback function as as an arrow function.

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.670
OK, I'm going to use arrow functions here, so I'm just going to say best song.

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.600
Right.

18
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.190
And what do I want this function to do so now I want to grab all the artists names out of this array.

19
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.730
So first stuff I have, I have to grab each of the objects so each of the objects is going to be best

20
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.360
song.

21
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.490
And from the these objects, I want to grab the artist.

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.700
So I'm going to say dot artist.

23
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.740
All right.

24
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.230
And now let's go ahead and let's save this inside a variable.

25
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.050
So this is artist's.

26
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.420
All right, and let's go ahead and let's call it consultors log artists.

27
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.090
I'd say that nuts come here and now we can see that we have six items inside this array because there

28
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.530
are six artists.

29
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.890
And the good thing about this is it creates in the order right now this method, it creates an area

30
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.170
populated with the search results that we pass inside our callback function.

31
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.180
Here is the MDN page.

32
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.920
You can go ahead and read more about it.

33
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.280
I'm just going to provide it here for you.

34
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.230
Just going just just pasted there.

35
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.070
Right.

36
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.990
And I think this is going to be it for the map method.

37
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.740
See you guys in the next one.
