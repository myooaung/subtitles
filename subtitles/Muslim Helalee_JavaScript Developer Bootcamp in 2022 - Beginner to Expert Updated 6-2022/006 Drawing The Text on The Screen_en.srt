1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,420
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,100
In this letter, we're going to draw the text on the screen.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,020
All right, so what is going to be the text, the text is going to either say the computer want or say

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,770
the human one or either going to say draw.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,220
So I'm going to come on top where we have declared our variables.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,800
And right beneath the colors, I'm going to create a comment that is going to say text.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,880
So the first one that I want to create is going to be text underscore EHI.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,320
So this is when the eye actually wins and it is going to say computer, computer.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,460
Right.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,490
And I'm just going to copy it down below and I'm going to change it to our eye and it is going to say

11
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,030
human.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,570
Perfect human.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,590
When a copy it down below and I'm going to say text tie one, it is a tie and it is going to say draw

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,090
and let's copy it one more time.

15
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,410
And when someone wins.

16
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,610
We are going to say one.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,030
So one that's come in, the colors are right and let's create the colors for them as well.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,780
So let me just copy that and bring it down below.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,090
And you're going to say color for the tie is going to be dark gray.

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,150
So dark gray.

21
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,110
We have we are going to I'm just going to provide a space there.

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,370
So we are going to have a color for the tie and there's going to be a color for the tie that is dark.

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,620
And it should be underscore, and this is going to be black.

24
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,730
Block, you're going to see these colors don't work, and then we are going to have a color for when

25
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,760
someone wins.

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,710
So it is going to be color underscored the eye end and I'm going to set it to blue and this blue is

27
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,760
going to highlight the winning cells for us.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,930
So now that these are done, let's head over.

29
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:23,320
To let's see to to our game loop, and I'm just going to call a function there.

30
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,000
So where is our game loop in here?

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,340
I'm going to call the draw text function.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,330
We have not created that.

33
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,030
I know we are going to create it right now.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,020
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to come right here is a drug Red.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,610
Highlight grid, create grid, draw grid, liar right here, it doesn't really matter where you put

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,030
them, I just want them to be like organized.

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,510
That's why I put it right here.

38
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,510
So in here, I'm going to say draw text function.

39
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,560
It's coming this one out.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:11,970
So function draw text, and we're not going to pass in any parameters now, these texts only can be

41
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,620
drawn on the screen when the game is over.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,610
So when the game is over, either it is going to be a a draw or a tie or it is going to be the in the

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,780
case that the computer has won or it is going to be the case that the that the human has won.

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,320
So we need to only draw the text whenever the game is over.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,710
So if the game is not over, we basically we just go ahead and return from the function.

46
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,600
Right.

47
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,770
So that's the condition that we need to check first.

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,850
And now, first off, we are going to set up the text parameters.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,610
So set of text.

50
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,610
Parameters.

51
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,930
Now, what is going to be decide, so I'm going to say the size is going to be the grid, where is our

52
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:10,100
grid, which has a these are the the zero and the zero column dots height.

53
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,350
So it's going to be any cells height.

54
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,200
The text is going to be dermo.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,690
Now let's go ahead and provide it with the first tile.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,900
Right now, we are dynamically drawing these texts, so it is either going to be computer one, then

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,800
it is going to or play a human one or so for the dynamic CARLETTI purposes.

58
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:40,660
I'm not going to hard code any styles for the film any like a stroke style or anything like that.

59
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,880
So we are just going to use a like a sort of.

60
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,000
General rule here, so in if any of those conditions present themselves, we would have something for

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,730
the we don't want to repeat ourselves.

62
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm not going to hard code anything here.

63
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,720
So first off, let's go ahead and let's say it's our text is going to have a fail and it is going to

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
have a stroke.

65
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,040
And why is that?

66
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,230
So let's see that here.

67
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,310
So, for example, let's let's actually try to win this game.

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,880
So what I when you can see that I'm going to zoom in so you can see that the text has some fell and

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,340
it has stroke as well.

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,790
So we need to accommodate for the fill and the stroke.

71
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,270
So first off, the tile.

72
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,720
It's going to be the game tied.

73
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,500
All right, and when the game is tied, how do we know when the game is tight, if the game tied is

74
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,240
true, we want to show the color that is for the tie, right?

75
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,380
What if it is player's turn?

76
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,560
What if the game tied is not true?

77
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,340
When the game tied is not true, it means that it is the player's turn.

78
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,890
And how do we know which player?

79
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,120
So if the player's turn is true, it is going to be the player.

80
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,990
R.I if it is false it is going to be the player

81
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,340
ehi perfect.

82
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,480
And that is going to be it for this.

83
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,570
So we are going to check if the game tied is true.

84
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,810
We are going to show that color.

85
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,440
If it is false, we are going to check for player's turn.

86
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,500
If player's turn is true, we are going to get on all right.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,560
Otherwise we are going to get color our.

88
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,390
So this is going to be the canvas Phil style that's grabbed the canvas font, which we have talked about

89
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,080
briefly.

90
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,930
Now, this this is going to be the size, that pixel size, font size.

91
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,370
And now we need to add on to it that pixel itself, pixel unit and the family is going to be sans serif.

92
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,020
Sans serif.

93
00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:00,040
Perfect, and let's go ahead and let's create the line with so we are going to see a line devoted to

94
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,360
each.

95
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:08,240
There is an increasing line with is going to be the size of the tax divided by 10.

96
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,540
You could go, you could make it bigger or you can make it smaller.

97
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,750
Now, let's go ahead now, this is the fill of that text.

98
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,200
What about the stroke of the text?

99
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:28,480
So we are going to say canvas, canvas, context, stroke style, stroke style.

100
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,160
It should be equal to if we need to check.

101
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,650
This is a Turner operator.

102
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,680
If game tied is true, we are going to show the color tie dark.

103
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,680
If game tied is not true, we are going to check for the players turn.

104
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,870
If the players return is true, we are going to show the color dark.

105
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:58,510
R.I and if foul play stern is not true, we are going to show the color a dark.

106
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,360
Perfect.

107
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:08,060
So this is how dynamic reality works in this context, we are going to grab the canvas context and we're

108
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,570
going to say text a line, you kid a line text as well.

109
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,700
I mean, how cool is that?

110
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,560
You just have to provide it inside quotes the alignment.

111
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,950
We want the text to be aligned in the center.

112
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,650
We want to grab the baseline of the text as well.

113
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,730
Canvas.

114
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:32,220
Canvas, context, art, text, baseline, and I'm going to set it to metal, so the text is in the

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,610
middle.

116
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:43,070
And now let's go ahead and actually draw these texts, so I'm going to say drawing the text perfect

117
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,800
now we are going to provide an offset for the texts as well.

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm going to provide it and I'm going to commented out so you can see where the offset is coming.

119
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,470
And I'm going to it's going to be half of the size of the text.

120
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,710
So let's grab or let's say let text.

121
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,080
So we have two different kind of texts.

122
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,100
Actually, three.

123
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,560
One is for the computer.

124
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,810
The other one is for the other for the human.

125
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,060
The other one is for the tie.

126
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,980
So if game tight is true, we are going to show the text for the tie.

127
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,390
If it is false, we are going to check which players alternatives.

128
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,210
If it is, the player's turn is true, it means that it is the real intelligence player's turn and we

129
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,830
are going to show the text for that.

130
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,690
Otherwise, we are going to show the text for the perfect, so we have done that as well.

131
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,730
Now, let's say F.

132
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,900
If game tied is true.

133
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,240
We need to draw that text, so if it is game tight now, we have stood this this turn into operator

134
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,060
within that text, now we need to use it, right.

135
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,500
So if game tied is true, what do you want to show through to the user?

136
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,910
We want to show the text for the tie that is drawn.

137
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,390
So we are going to grab the canvas context stroke.

138
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,850
Text.

139
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,760
This is going to be a function what is the text?

140
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,650
The text is going to be the text that we have specified there.

141
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:28,130
The you can see that it requires an exposition and then a Y position and a max with.

142
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,540
So what is the exposition?

143
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,420
The exposition is going to be the width divided by two.

144
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,670
It means that it should be in the center of the canvas and the height should be divided by two in the

145
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,310
center of the canvas vertically and horizontally.

146
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,130
OK, there we go.

147
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,070
We have specified it with so we do not need to specify the max.

148
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,680
And now let's go ahead and let's fill that text.

149
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,330
So filled text.

150
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,660
Uh huh.

151
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,380
Let's it's actually going to be the same thing.

152
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,700
So the text and the middle.

153
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,170
Perfect.

154
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,800
Let's put it right there or else else it means that either the computer has one or the game is not tied.

155
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,040
So either the computer or the human has one.

156
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,700
So can this context dot stroke, text, stroke text?

157
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,650
And we are going to provide that here as well, so the same thing, so all of the texts are going to

158
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,580
show in the same spot and we are going to show the text.

159
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:39,080
So this is going to be the film text, Phil text and what text should that be the we are going to show

160
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,200
the text when for that.

161
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,530
All right.

162
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,180
So it's either the computer or the we have talked about that a lot.

163
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,540
So what I'm going to do is.

164
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,590
It's called the canvas context, dot stroke text.

165
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:03,050
And let's provide the text when text when the position is going to be the same.

166
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,730
So this just copy the position, it's going to be right there.

167
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,200
And we are also going to have a text.

168
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:20,660
So text, text when with and directly in the center so we could go ahead and test this.

169
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,630
But in order to test what we have done here is now you can see we have not used the offset.

170
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,230
We are going to use that one.

171
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,070
I'm going to go where I'm going to go is let's see, where is our check game check when where did you

172
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,640
provide it?

173
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,850
So instead of returning false, I wanted to return.

174
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,270
True, because we want to check that text.

175
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,020
So let's see.

176
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,110
Hopefully it works.

177
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,360
So there we go.

178
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,210
So if I come here, you can see that whenever I click, it is just going to say the computer one and

179
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,640
you can see that the text is on top of each other.

180
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:03,010
And if I click again and you can see that it says the computer one in both cases and first off, let's

181
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:08,450
go ahead and let's take care of the this offset.

182
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,160
So if I provide it, let's come down.

183
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,660
Where is our function?

184
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:21,070
Right here, so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to provide the offset, I'm going to subtract

185
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,960
the offset from the height in here.

186
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,250
So offset.

187
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,940
And I'm going to subtracted from the height here as well, offset and for the text when I'm just going

188
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,550
to add it so offset.

189
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:44,520
Offset Soviet, let's click on it and you can see the rest, some sort of offset, but still they are

190
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,680
connected to each other.

191
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,380
And I'm just going to go to top.

192
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,310
Let's check let's turn this to oh and lower case and.

193
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:54,760
Hmm.

194
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,190
I'm just going to increase the offset to zero point six.

195
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:05,350
And if I click, you can see there is more space there, but you can see that these spikes going out

196
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,410
out of that, that is because of the line join the line joints should be around.

197
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,700
So what we're going to do is canvass context.

198
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,860
Canvas context.

199
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,740
I believe it's line joint.

200
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,730
Yeah, it is, and we are going to set it to round.

201
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,050
So let's have it.

202
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,720
Let's come here.

203
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,170
There we go.

204
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,590
Now, we cannot see any more spikes in here, so we can see the computer one in both cases, we can

205
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,750
see it says the computer one.

206
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:44,520
All right, so just this week, ABC computer one, it's green to computer one, you can see the stroke

207
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,540
with and the fill with that filled text.

208
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,180
But there seems to be a problem in both cases.

209
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,060
It's this computer.

210
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,800
I know we should check for when the player wins or the computer wins.

211
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,140
So this is where actually it's happening.

212
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,360
This is where we're dry.

213
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,340
So we say if game tied is true, why is why is this in parentheses?

214
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,410
So let's remove the parentheses.

215
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,190
If game tied is true, we want to change.

216
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,480
We want to write the text of time otherwise that this is the problem.

217
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,310
This should be semicolon, this should be Colen.

218
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,990
Otherwise, we are going to check for the player's turn if player's return is true.

219
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,270
So otherwise players stern is true.

220
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,560
If it is true, we are going to set it to text r.i otherwise are going to set it to text ehi so let's

221
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,450
save it now.

222
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:46,110
This is a computer one and when you click you can see that we can still select these which we shouldn't

223
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,310
and we are going to fix that.

224
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,810
Don't worry.

225
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,540
Now if I click the game is now it's just a human.

226
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:52,710
There we go.

227
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,810
So it's just human want.

228
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,330
So computer one human one.

229
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,530
We don't see any tie.

230
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:06,870
Now that, that only happens because when we went up to the check, when whenever any of the users they

231
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:14,220
play any they put any piece, then it would be just a win for that specific user.

232
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,680
And OK, so I think I think with this, our lecture comes to an end to see you guys in the next one.
