00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,990
Hi, everyone, welcome to the second part of creating a note playing function.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,480
All right, so we have created this function, but we are not done with it yet, there is a lot of things

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,440
that we want this function to do, and I have created a constant of note audio and we have selected

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,930
the document and the idea.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,580
But the idea is dynamic.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,140
And now we have to make sure we understand this dynamic idea that we have created.

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,380
So I'm just going to go ahead because we need real estate on the screen.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:36,820
All right.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,400
So let's go ahead and let's increase the width of this, Ed, so we know what the key is.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,810
Whenever when we said we have said key document that element get document that determined by the key.

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,900
We know what exactly that means.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,680
It means whenever we click on any of these keys, we are going to get get that specific key associated

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,590
with the click event.

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,400
Right.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,459
So we have successfully understood that.

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,030
Now, let's go ahead and let's talk about the DOT data set.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,730
What is this?

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,380
So let's let's consider the consulate to the log and let's go over it, click on it.

19
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:20,350
And then here it is going to give me a dumb string map map and inside that and you guys can see this

20
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,250
is an object.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,140
Right.

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,830
But this is not an object.

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,660
It is a dumb string map.

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,650
It is going to map for whatever it is that we are working with.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,150
It behaves like an object, but it is not an object.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,350
It is not a true object.

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,260
It's not pure of heart.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,320
Right.

29
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,430
So we can whenever we have an object, we can access the key value pairs of that object.

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,900
We can access the properties of that object right through the dot notation.

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,620
That's why we say that note.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,220
And in here you guys can see it says note.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,540
All right.

34
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:04,300
So if I were to comment that out and come here and say dot note, we should be able to grab this specific

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,889
note that we want to play whenever that specific key has been clicked.

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:18,490
So click we are going to play C click D flat click E flat click, G flat, A flat and B flat.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,290
Right.

38
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,250
So we have successfully done that.

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,940
And this is why we say key the data set that note.

40
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,610
And what I'm going to do is because this is going to get very, very clutterham I'm going to remove

41
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,130
the council box because that part is easy.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,910
I just wanted to get you up to speed of what we are doing because this seems like a very, very cool

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,590
project.

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,570
So I want to make sure that you understand every part of it.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,300
So now we have successfully selected this, right?

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:56,730
So what I'm going to do is let's go ahead and let's call in another method and that method is going

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,360
to be play.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,990
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come here and I'm going to say no dot idea.

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,190
Why do I keep writing?

50
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,100
It is not known that I do.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,830
It is this constant.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,390
What is the name of this constant?

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,620
Let's put it here and let's say play.

54
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,170
Save it.

55
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,560
It does point C and each time the sound is different now, this is another method that we can use.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,290
Basically, we grab it by the element ID and we say play the note and we know what that note is because

57
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,720
the note has the same name as well.

58
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,530
All right.

59
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,520
So it is going to play this note, right?

60
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,770
And it is going to grab the idea and this idea belongs to an idea, and whenever we grab the idea,

61
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,690
it is going to play the source for us.

62
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,170
So we have successfully been able to click and play.

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,970
So each time we place a different one.

64
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,330
So what if I go ahead and click multiple times on this so you can hear the clicking?

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,330
So when I click.

66
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,140
The first time it is going to play the note, that's cool, we have understood that part, but what

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,930
if I click a second time very quickly after the first time?

68
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,250
Now, it is not going to play it like a real piano.

69
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:29,460
So whenever you push a piano, keys, a piano key multiple times, it is going to play that note multiple

70
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,910
times.

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,530
It is not going to wait for that note to end to play the second time.

72
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm going to repeat myself whenever we have a real world piano, whenever we have a physical, tangible

73
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,480
piano, and when you press a key on that piano, it is going to play a note.

74
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,400
When you press it very quickly two times it is going to play that note two times.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,040
But what happens in this case is because first off, this is not a physical piano.

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,600
Right.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,450
But we should get close to a physical piano.

78
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,570
Whenever I click on this, it is going to play that note.

79
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,220
And when I double click on it, it means I'm just double tapping.

80
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,980
So I should hear the note being played twice.

81
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,680
So let's let's hear it now.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,150
We just heard it once.

83
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:28,440
The reason for that is we are going to hear that the second time, whenever the first time the audio

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,620
has been done, the audio is finished.

85
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,100
So when the note and then another note place, we don't want that.

86
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,190
We want to be able to play this key multiple times quickly.

87
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
That's how real world pianos work.

88
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,180
So I'm going to come on top of there and I'm going to say no to audio.

89
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,310
Let's grab our constant and we are going to say current time.

90
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,250
Now, this is a very, very cool property property and we are going to set it to zero.

91
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,340
And what this current time does is whenever we click on it, it is going to basically this is going

92
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,790
to play the note according to our clip.

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,300
So let's hear it.

94
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,570
Well, correct.

95
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,760
There is an end missing.

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,670
I was kind of like, oh, this is not playing.

97
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,610
I was panicking in my mind, in my brains, in my head, in my head.

98
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,210
Right.

99
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,890
So now let's click on it.

100
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,690
And I'm sure you understand the difference.

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm just going to go ahead and do it one more time.

102
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,300
It's so fun.

103
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,000
So see, so what we had before was.

104
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm sure you can hear the clicking.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,310
It was like bam, bam, bam, and now it's blue.

106
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,070
It's like this.

107
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:50,780
All right.

108
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,760
So we have successfully done that as well.

109
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,200
So now let's go ahead and let's implement the color.

110
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,680
So when I click on any of these keys, it is going to switch the Carter showing that that key has been

111
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,230
pressed.

112
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,040
Now, let's go ahead and do that for that.

113
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,930
We do have, if you remember correctly, we have an active class.

114
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,820
So now let's go ahead and let's add this active class.

115
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,670
So we are going to say a key dot class list.

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,860
Come on, buddy.

117
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,420
Keep that class list dot at.

118
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,460
What is the cost that we want to add?

119
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,730
It is the class of fact, so let's save it.

120
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,680
And now we do get but there is a big problem.

121
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,970
The class is not being removed.

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,560
So whenever the note is done or whenever the clicking is done, we want to remove the class.

123
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,570
So now the class has been added.

124
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,050
The class has been out.

125
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,040
And now let's go ahead and remove it.

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,580
Right.

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,740
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create.

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,980
Let's go ahead.

129
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,620
Let's grab the node, that idea.

130
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,060
And we are going to say that at a event listener, you're going to add an event listener.

131
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:06,440
And the event listener is going to listen for an extended event we do have in that event as well.

132
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,610
And when the note is ended, when the event is ended, actually, what is the event the event is like?

133
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,870
So when the event is ended, what do we want to do?

134
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,420
We want to run a function.

135
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,730
And what does the function is going to do?

136
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,230
What does the function?

137
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,790
What is the function going to do?

138
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:31,010
The function is going to grab our key and is going to say classless that your guests are right to remove

139
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,590
it is going to remove the active class, save it now click.

140
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:44,240
It is going to go away because whenever the note is done playing, it is going to remove the C.

141
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,140
We can still see two keys being played.

142
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,900
Of course, whenever you're playing piano, you might have you might be playing like clicking or pressing

143
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,740
multiple keys.

144
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,640
But still, when you're done with that note, the key should come up.

145
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,630
This is basically like a like showcasing a real world piano.

146
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,150
Like whenever you see this background color, it means that it means that the key is being pressed.

147
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,090
So sort of we are done with this play note function.

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,790
So the next thing you can say that this project is done.

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,420
But what I want to do is I want to implement the key functionality, the key of the keyboard functionality

150
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,770
as well.

151
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,510
So we are going to start implementing those from our next lecture.

152
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,730
See you guys then.
