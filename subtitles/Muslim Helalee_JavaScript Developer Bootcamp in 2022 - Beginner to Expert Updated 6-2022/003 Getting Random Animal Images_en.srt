1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,630
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to get the random animal images.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,700
All right, so first things first, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all these three deaths

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,270
and I'm going to grab all these three buttons.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:26,890
So let's go ahead and let's say consed I'm going to do let let Cat be equal to document that query selector.

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,720
So the class first off we get the diff.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,170
So it's going to be cat.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,200
And then we are going to change it to dog and we can also change it to.

8
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,360
OK, let's change it to Fox and I'm going to bring Fox in the middle.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:46,920
All right.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:54,600
So we have successfully selected all the three debates and now let's select the three buttons.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,800
So I'm just going to call them that button and we are going to document that query selector and the

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,170
classes get get Cat Scoppetta two times.

13
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,080
I'm going to change this to dog.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:20,750
So it is dark and I'm going to change this one to Fox, so now that this is out of the way, what do

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,860
we want to do here?

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
All right, let's think about that first now.

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,220
OK, so I'm just going to go ahead and open the live server so we can see our changes.

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,880
All right, so there we go.

19
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,520
So this is a project, it doesn't work, of course.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,240
So what do we want to do here?

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:44,570
Whenever I click on this button, I want that image to be fetched for this project.

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,760
We are going to use the fetch API.

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,610
All right.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,680
But this is going to be the fetch API object that is included in the JavaScript.

25
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,880
All right.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,310
And then in the next project, you are going to use async awaked.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,180
Right?

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:06,830
So whenever you click on this, this click event is actually associated with a fetch API call.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,180
Right.

30
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,860
So whenever you click on it, it is going to call the server and ask for an ad for a specific image.

31
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,570
All right.

32
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,420
So what we are going to do here is we are going to add event listeners for all of the buttons.

33
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,370
So we are going to add event listeners.

34
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,830
The event, of course, is going to be click.

35
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,570
And when the click event happens, we are going to say get random cat.

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,990
So we are going to have three events because we are going to have three

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,230
three functions and three animals.

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,940
So I'm going to change this to Fox and I'm going to change this to dog.

39
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,150
Let's make this F capital, the Saudi capital.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,490
So first off, let's come into the public APIs repository.

41
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,610
So we have Cat, we have Fox and then we have duck.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,050
So inside the cat you can see whenever we make a call to this, you are Al and it will require.

43
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,120
So this is going to be the real this is the data or the response that we are going to get.

44
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,580
So first off, let's go ahead and let's implement the random cat images.

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,730
So what I'm going to do, I'm just going to comment out.

46
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,220
I'm going to say get random cat images.

47
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,160
Right.

48
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,210
So we want these images to be fetched whenever we click that button.

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
So we are going to say, let's call the get random cat.

50
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,960
So, all right, whenever we click it, we want to fetch that.

51
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,580
So for using the fetch object, it's very simple.

52
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,440
You just have to pass and TTP the the DPR.

53
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,940
So let's copy that and let's put it right here.

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,400
All right.

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,280
And then.

56
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,020
So this is going to return a promise when it returns.

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:09,950
A promise we can tag on a dot then and we are going to say so the response, not capital.

58
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,530
Right.

59
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,310
So the response, what is the response going to be?

60
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,540
The response is is just going to be a return response.

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,200
OK, well, there is something that I need to tell you about our functions.

62
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,720
If you want to return something, just don't provide the curly braces.

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,420
If you provide the curly braces, only in that case you're allowed to write the return keyword.

64
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,720
That's why when I wrote it, you can see that there is an error actually here because we don't have

65
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,590
curly braces.

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,740
When you have curly braces and you see a return, that's OK.

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,520
But if you just want to if you if it is just one simple line of code and you want to return it, don't

68
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
just don't provide the curly braces.

69
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:03,870
OK, so we are going to say a return response, Jason, so we know that the response is something that

70
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,950
we need to do the Jason on it.

71
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,530
And why do we and what is the Dodgson method going to do?

72
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,130
The Jason method is going to do three things right.

73
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:22,410
So first thing, it is going to read it, convert it into a Jason file, then it is going to sorry first

74
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,100
is going to read it, then it is going to convert it into adjacent file.

75
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,880
Then it is going to pass that JSON file for us.

76
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,550
Right.

77
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:36,540
So now if I say it, we are not going to see anything else because we have successfully passed the data,

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,360
but we have not like used it anywhere.

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,850
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say response data and I just want to I just want to log

80
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,630
it to the console.

81
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,960
So we are going to say cancel the log response data.

82
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,830
So let's say that it's come here.

83
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,150
So this is where we're working with.

84
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,530
So what I'm going to do, I'm going I'm going to go in to inspect and let's bring it down.

85
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,050
Let's go to council, get random fox.

86
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,970
So until we specify until we define these functions, I'm just going to call them out.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,910
So if I click on this, I get a cat image, you can see that we get the same URL that we get here,

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,600
right?

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,910
So this is actually that we have an inside ops room inside this object.

90
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,920
What do we have?

91
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,180
We have only one property, and that property is actually the source for that image.

92
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,700
So what do we want to do?

93
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,190
We want to create an image element.

94
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,590
And for the source, we are going to provide this dynamic source, which is right here.

95
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,460
Right.

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,410
And where is this source coming from?

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,010
So if I were to say response data, dot.

98
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,150
If I were to say so, what is the name of this, it is going to be file.

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,830
Is it the cat?

100
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,580
Meow.

101
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:08,220
Yeah, it is the cat, so I'm just going to say response file, response data, I'm going to say file.

102
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,850
So when I say file, we're going to get that specific URL for that image.

103
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,250
So if I click on it, you can see this URL, we get that era.

104
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,120
So what do I want to do with that?

105
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,260
You are I'm just going to cut this and I'm going to delete this console log.

106
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,970
And instead of that, I'm going to create curly braces.

107
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,870
So we want to grab our fox sorry, our cat.

108
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,360
So right here, that diff.

109
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:40,030
So I'm going to say can't enter HTML should be equal to what the cat that Interreg HTML should be.

110
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,370
I'm just going to provide in here tactics.

111
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:52,490
So let's create the image element and the source for this image element is going to come from that response

112
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,870
data that file, but we need to provide it inside this, this template literals.

113
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:05,290
So it, it, it actually when you provide it inside the template literal, it is going to grab the value

114
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,710
of response data file and it is going to put it right here.

115
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,740
So if I were to save it, we can see we don't have any errors here and no errors inside the console.

116
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,670
And when I click the cat image when we should be able to get this image and there we go.

117
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,660
So we have we have gotten this image.

118
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,640
If I click on it, we are going to get another image.

119
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,030
So it doesn't matter how many times you click it, you are going to get a random image for a cat.

120
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,679
So I'm just going to close this.

121
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,039
So we have successfully implemented this cat.

122
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,980
The rest of the two are going to be easy.

123
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,820
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to create them in this video and I'm just going to copy this

124
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,480
comment.

125
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,740
Creating it takes a long time.

126
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,560
So the second one is Fox.

127
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,610
So what do we do?

128
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,610
We have created the Center for the Fox.

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,800
Now, let's go ahead and let's create the function.

130
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,030
Function and get random folks.

131
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,290
All right, we are going to say fetch and.

132
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,290
What is the URL so.

133
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,210
Get random folks, I'm just going to copy that you are htp real, let's put it there.

134
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:26,780
So it is going to return a promise and we can say that the procedure is going to be the same.

135
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,760
First off, we get the promise and we convert it into something that can be converted into something

136
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,940
that can be passed by JavaScript, can be read by JavaScript through this response.

137
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,200
Jason method.

138
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:49,910
So we are going to see a response and let's say a response, convert it to something that can be read

139
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,720
by JavaScript.

140
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,610
And then then after that, we want to grab our response.

141
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,720
And I'm just going to call a response data.

142
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,440
And what do we want to do?

143
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:07,430
First off, let's go ahead and let's log it to the console response data so we know what we are working

144
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,770
with.

145
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,310
Right.

146
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,860
So let's come here.

147
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,840
So now if I click on the Fox, we should get something inside this console and we don't get anything.

148
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,730
So let's take a look at it.

149
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,040
We have response to Jason and we have.

150
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:36,670
Response data council response data, right, and it is get random Fox, Fox, b10, oh, this is incorrect.

151
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,500
So let's change it to Fox.

152
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,250
Let's save it.

153
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,280
Now, if I click on the Fox, we get this.

154
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,960
You are now inside this.

155
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,290
You are.

156
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,670
We have two things.

157
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,580
Keep in mind, we have to think we have two properties.

158
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,720
The first property is going to be image.

159
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,160
You know what?

160
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,890
I'm just going to bring this up and zoom in.

161
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,060
So the first property is image and the second one is like we are interested in the image.

162
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:09,040
So if I were to say here, dot image and save it and click on it, we should we get a source for for

163
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,090
a specific image.

164
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,490
So we are going to do basically the same thing.

165
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,430
I'm going to copy, I'm going to cut this and I'm going to remove the cancer log and I'm going to say,

166
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,590
what do we want to do here?

167
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:28,510
We are going to grab the fox container and we are going to say that enter HTML should be equal to let's

168
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,190
create that image tag.

169
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:38,410
You can see that that image tag is not present inside this inside the e-mail, we are creating a dynamically.

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
And what is going to be the source?

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,500
The source is going to be basically response date and let's put them inside current braces.

172
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,220
And Idella, so now everything should be working perfectly fine.

173
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,010
So if I bring this down and if I click on it, we should get a fox image here and there we go.

174
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,350
Instead of one fox, we go to Foxy's.

175
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,810
All right.

176
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,800
So now the fox is done as well.

177
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,280
And I'm just going to go ahead and implement the dog one as well.

178
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,320
So let's grab this.

179
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,610
Put it right here.

180
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,040
You can see that this API is simple.

181
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,410
You just have an API and whenever you contacted you are going to get a response, convert it to read

182
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,980
it, convert it to Jason and then pass it.

183
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,860
And then we see what's inside that file.

184
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,810
And when we and then we grab it.

185
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:29,520
Right.

186
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,220
So this is going to be the simplest API that we're working with.

187
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:41,510
So for now, for this dog, we are going to come and this one back in, get random dog, get random,

188
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,020
not Fox Dog.

189
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,010
And again, we are going to make a fetch request.

190
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,920
So let's remove the clause that so this is going to be worth the design.

191
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,970
Right.

192
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,130
And we are going to say fetch.

193
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,460
Let's just put in the you are it is going to be a promise.

194
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:08,410
So we are going to sell a response and we just want to return response to Jason.

195
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:17,380
And when we return that we are going to say that then and we are going to say a response data I could

196
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,370
console log it.

197
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,490
So console log to see what what it is that we get, actually.

198
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,970
So let's save it.

199
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,930
Let's come here.

200
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,820
So I'm just going to close this one.

201
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,300
And if I click on the dog, what do we get?

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,230
We get this.

203
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,630
So we get a u r l in this time we get two properties file size bytes.

204
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,870
So this is the size and we get a you are out.

205
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,710
So you are of course the you are l is the thing that we are interested in.

206
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,510
So I'm just going to write here.

207
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,640
How is it lowercase.

208
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,960
Yeah it is lowercase.

209
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,780
So we are going to say that you are l and when I say that when, when I click on the dog image we get

210
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:55,960
this.

211
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,640
You are a keep in mind this, all of this data is is being fetched without refreshing the page or so

212
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,990
called on the fly.

213
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:05,800
Right.

214
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,620
So let's cut this, remove this and what do we want to do?

215
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,860
We want to grab the dog container and we are going to say that.

216
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:27,260
Our HTML, let's create that image tag, so image, let's provide the source for it, the source is

217
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,760
going to be that that's surrounded by curly braces and put in a dollar sign and that's it.

218
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,500
That's basically it to doing to grabbing and generating random images.

219
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,630
So we just very, very simple.

220
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,510
Just created just grab the device, grab the buttons, create a function inside the function, just

221
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:47,930
fetch.

222
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:55,040
So if I click on the dog, we should be able to get an image for a specific dog.

223
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,450
So now reload the page, click.

224
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:09,580
We get a cat image and reload the page, we get a fox image, reload the page, sorry, click this.

225
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,310
Why do I keep saying reload the page?

226
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,150
No, not reload.

227
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,320
Just click on this button and you're going to get a different dog image.

228
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,590
So different, different, different.

229
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,150
It doesn't matter how many times you click on it.

230
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,010
Now, what is the use case?

231
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:29,620
You might ask the use cases, for example, whenever you want to create a specific for example, you

232
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,890
want to create a website and inside which you don't want to like, you can see that it is going to give

233
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,110
you gifts or gifts as well.

234
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:49,390
And you don't want to like, let's say, insert images and like increase the size of your entire project.

235
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:49,850
Right.

236
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,430
You don't want to do that and you just want to grab images on the fly.

237
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,990
So that way your website loads faster, then this is one of the ways that you can do it.

238
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:00,360
All right.

239
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,340
So that's going to be it for this lecture and this chapter.

240
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,090
See you guys in the next one.
