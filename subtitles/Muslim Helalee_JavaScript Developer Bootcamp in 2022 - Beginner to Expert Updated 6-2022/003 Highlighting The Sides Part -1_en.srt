1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:02,930
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,520
In this election, we will be creating the square cloths on its properties.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:18,240
All right, so let's say Class Square and we are going to put in our constructor, we're going to have

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,660
an exposition in Y position A with and a height, they're going to say this start with is going to be

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,500
equal to w this dot h is going to be equal to height, this start button.

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:41,940
Bottom is going to be equal to the Y position, plus the height of this dot left is going to be equal

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,360
to.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:54,170
The ex that we have this dot, right, is going to be called to X plus the width that we have.

9
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,660
Then this top.

10
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,170
The start top is going to be equal to the Y position.

11
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:12,080
Now I'm going to provide because whenever we hover on the grid, any of when we hover inside, any of

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,420
the specific that target square either of the sides, whichever is closer to where the mouse cursor

13
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,360
is pointing, that is going to be highlighted.

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,280
So we need a highlight as well.

15
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,960
And initially that is going to be zero or null.

16
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:39,080
We are going to also check for how many sites have been selected, because based on that, we can say

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:46,310
that whoever has completed the final side and whenever that square has all four sides felt or connected,

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,360
we are going to draw a score there.

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,090
They're going to put it to zero initially and we're going to grab the owner of that cell initially.

20
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,650
No cell has any owner.

21
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,160
Then let's go ahead and let's grab all the sites.

22
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:08,690
So first off, let's grab the side bottom and the side bottom is going to have is a small object.

23
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,470
It is going to have owner, which is initially null and it is going to have a selected property, which

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,620
is going to be no, sorry, false as false.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,410
Let's create let's copy that three times.

26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:30,200
And in here we have we are going to have our side left for which the owner is null and the selected

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,740
is false.

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:39,590
Then we have this side right there with the same object and then side.

29
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,220
Top.

30
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,880
All right, so we have we have successfully created that the next step that I would like to do as I'm

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,150
going to go top and I'm going to create some game variables.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,540
So below our context, I'm just going to right here game game variables.

33
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,870
And here we are going to create our current cells so grown cells are ready.

34
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,700
So this is going to be current cells.

35
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,590
We are going to create the players turn, whichever players turn.

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,780
It is so players turn.

37
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,910
We are also going to create a squares, a right that is going to contain the squares which have been

38
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,560
selected.

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,060
Right.

40
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,910
So what do we have here?

41
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,900
Here we have current cells, players turn and squares.

42
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,310
Right after that.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,460
I would like to create a function called New Game.

44
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,750
So I'm going to come down here and this is going to be responsible for calling a new game for us.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,770
So let's go ahead and let's create that.

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:49,830
And it's going to be a new game function, new game, and it's not going to have any.

47
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,390
Parameters.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,510
So the first thing that I would like to do here is I would like to create a coin toss kind of and kind

49
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,380
of situation.

50
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,930
Let me rephrase that.

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,610
I would like to create a situation in which we have 50 percent chance that it is going to be the player's

52
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,550
turn player one and 50 percent chance that is going to be the player to a.k.a. computers turn.

53
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:28,170
OK, so we are going to say player's turn is going to be equal to math, dot random lowercase times.

54
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,400
It is going to return the boolean.

55
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:40,860
So we are going to check whenever it is equal to a zero, whenever it is equal or greater than zero.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,360
So, OK, so we should not put in a multiplication sign there and it is going to return that bullet

57
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,680
for us, right.

58
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,290
So.

59
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,550
The next step that I would like to do here is.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,300
We have to draw our squares as well, so why don't we why don't we go ahead and actually draw those

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,220
squares and.

62
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,920
We are going to call the hour, draw squares, function within our game loop, so inside here, what

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:23,930
I would like to do is below the board and I'm going to I'm going to call a function that is going to

64
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,330
be draw squares.

65
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,790
So we will have two functions that are going to sound a bit similar.

66
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,350
One is going to be draw squares.

67
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,000
The other one is going to be draw scores.

68
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,130
And that is going to be something that we will be doing towards the end.

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,030
Right.

70
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,500
So let's come down here.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,360
Where is this is a drug threat and I'm going to grab this and we could go ahead and collapse these,

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,110
I mean, if we needed them, we are going to expand them.

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,970
But for now, I'm going to keep this new game open because we are going to work a lot in there and this

74
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,900
is going to be draw squares perfect.

75
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,830
So we are going to have a function, draw squares.

76
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:16,730
So what are we going to have inside this function, we want this function to draw squares for us now

77
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,730
before actually drawing squares.

78
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:29,080
This function should be able to handle should be able to get some sort of like an array from us.

79
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,560
Right.

80
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:37,410
Because in our game variables, we have said that this squares is actually an array.

81
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,580
So what I'm going to do is before actually creating that function inside our new game function, I'm

82
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,330
going to go ahead and I'm going to say setup the squares array, because if you don't have any array,

83
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:56,910
how would you how would we be able to actually iterate over it and in each iteration draw it?

84
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,550
So let's actually reset it first in case there is something.

85
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:09,560
And after that, we are going to say for let the AI is going to start from zero, I'm going to go all

86
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,790
the way to less than what?

87
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,460
Less than the grid size.

88
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,000
Perfect.

89
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,030
And we are going to increment I by one.

90
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,540
Right.

91
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,780
This is in each iteration.

92
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,370
This is going to have a specific value which we are going to store inside our inside a new array, and

93
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,240
then we are going to iterate over the grid size one more time.

94
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,140
All right, and working for Aulet J equals zero and J is less than the grid size.

95
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,720
Perfect, and we are going to increment by one each time and each time this happens, we're going to

96
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,320
call our squares array and we are going to pass and I and Jay.

97
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,630
And this is going to be equal to our the instantiation of our square class.

98
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,380
So we are going to say square now for that.

99
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,600
What do we need to pass?

100
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,400
So we have a constructor that is going to accept four parameters for each parameter we need to pass

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,370
in one argument.

102
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,370
So what is the exposition?

103
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,260
The exposition off the grid is going to be that get grid X that we created before and I'm going to pass

104
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,110
in there.

105
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,660
What is the Y position that is going to be the get grid y position?

106
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,490
And I'm going to pass on either what is going to be the with the with if the South is going to be the

107
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,890
sell itself, the height of the sell is going to be sell as well.

108
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,549
So let's save that.

109
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,380
Let's come here.

110
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,550
We don't have anything.

111
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,540
Of course we don't have any highlighting.

112
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,620
We basically first setting up the squares and highlighting we will handle later.

113
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,700
So now that this is in place, where is our draw squarest function?

114
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,080
We need to go ahead and we need to actually draw these squares.

115
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,760
So now we have our array and we know how we can iterate over it.

116
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,210
So we are going to say for a row of what is the array?

117
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,350
The array is squares for that row of squares.

118
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,260
And then we are going to iterate over each cell as well, our each square, to be exact.

119
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,390
Michelet Square.

120
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Alvira.

121
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,050
So what do we want to do with this?

122
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,350
We want to grab our loop variable, which is square in this case, and we are going to call a method

123
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,060
that is going to be draw sides, that's going to draw the sides.

124
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,870
And we are going to call another method as well that is going to be draw fail.

125
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,780
So whenever we hover on that.

126
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,180
Oops.

127
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:57,290
Close, this was cited, so whenever we hover on that, you can see this is our highlight and then when

128
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:03,710
you click, you're going to see that it says that it is going to be like actually filling this right.

129
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,390
So we need to set both of them up as well.

130
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,320
So what will what I am going to do as.

131
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm going to go to my class, so we have created the draw squares, so within the class, right?

132
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,810
But before actually doing that, I would like to pass in a situation as well, so I'm going to create

133
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:36,750
a function that is going to be contains I'm thinking that do I have to pass the function right now or

134
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,210
I should wait until it comes up.

135
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,410
Hmm.

136
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,600
So we have to create that at some point.

137
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,970
All right, and we are going to create this function whenever we get to actually highlighting, so I'm

138
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,800
not going to confuse you any further.

139
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,110
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to create the draw sites for now and I'm going to create this

140
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:06,440
function later, because this is going to be used for calling the highlighting itself.

141
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,540
So what is the function name?

142
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,610
The function name is going to be draw sides.

143
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:16,870
This is going to be a function expression and actually an error function.

144
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,220
So in here, what is it that we want to do?

145
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,250
First off, we want to check if there is actually some highlighting going on.

146
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,210
Right.

147
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,380
So I'm going to say hi.

148
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:38,510
I think they're going to f this dot highlight is not is not null.

149
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,190
If it is not null, then we want to draw the site.

150
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,150
OK, if any side has not been highlighted, we do not want to draw that.

151
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,620
So we are going to call a draw side method in here.

152
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,310
And for the drop side method, this is not going to be draw sides.

153
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:05,150
So keep in mind we have one for draw sides, one for drawing each individual side.

154
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,490
And we are going to pass on this does highlight whichever side has been highlighted and we are going

155
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:20,380
to call another helper method, which is going to be get color, which is going to give us the color.

156
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,850
So the color is going to be based on the player's turn.

157
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,600
And the second.

158
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:36,460
The second argument in here is going to be a boolean, and that is whenever we call this get color,

159
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:43,480
we are going to pass on a boolean because we want to check if any site has not been highlighted and

160
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,840
we want to highlight it, then we want to highlight it with the light color.

161
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,690
So it is going to be true.

162
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,790
So the light is going to be true if and then we are going to call this function again for whenever we

163
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,650
want to complete that or fill that highlight.

164
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,490
So when the side is highlighted and we want to fill that, in that case, we do not want to grab the

165
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,420
light color.

166
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,790
So the light color is going to be false in here because we are highlighting it.

167
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,910
It is going to be true.

168
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,900
Ah, right.

169
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,550
And let's go ahead and let's create this jet color function, so what I'm going to do as.

170
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,750
I'm going to come on top here and I'm going to grab this comment, let us start one.

171
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:37,100
All right, so in here, let's just pass it on and it is going to be get color.

172
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,560
Function, get color and.

173
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,280
We have two arguments, so we need two parameters, right, because we are basically checking which

174
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:59,870
players turn it is and either we need to grab that light color or that like not so light color.

175
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,800
So we are going to pass in player and we are going to pass and light, not night light caite.

176
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,210
All right.

177
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,570
So if it is the player's turn, if it is if player is true, we want to return.

178
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,570
We want to return.

179
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,220
And in this return, we are checking for something.

180
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,440
If it is light, we will return the color player light.

181
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,260
If it is not light, if light is not true, we are going to return color player.

182
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,650
Very simple, as if it is not player's turn.

183
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,670
It means it is either the other players turn or as we would like to call it, in our next game.

184
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,840
It is the eyes.

185
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,120
So it's in this game.

186
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,440
It is going to be two players.

187
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,890
One of them happens to have a name of EHI or a computer.

188
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
In our next game we will automate that thing.

189
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,880
All right.

190
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,430
So I hope you're not getting confused by this.

191
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:09,200
Return if lt is true, we want to return for for the I want to return the light light if it is not true,

192
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,140
we want to return that not so light color that we have there.

193
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,170
Right, so now that we have created this function, we have what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

194
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,300
on top and I'm going to create an object and I'm going to call it cites.

195
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,320
The reason that we recreate that is we don't have to.

196
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:39,600
I think we did the same thing with our breakout game where we created a directions object just to avoid

197
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,940
typing directions all the time.

198
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,090
We are just going to store it within an object and then reuse that object as many times as we want.

199
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:54,320
So right below here, I'm going to create a side object.

200
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,820
So in this case, of course, it's not going to be directions, it's just going to be any side that

201
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,810
has been highlighted.

202
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,760
So I'm going to say const capital aside equal to an object.

203
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,740
So the first side is going to be bottom and the value for that is going to be zero.

204
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:20,310
The second side is going to be left for which the values one right after that we have right.

205
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,240
Which is two.

206
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,100
And finally we have TARP, which is three.

207
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:34,620
So now that we have created this, what I would like to do, as I would like to create a function that

208
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:41,790
is going to be called draw a line, and this function is actually responsible for drawing lines for

209
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,090
us.

210
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,940
All right.

211
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,920
So where should I put this function?

212
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:55,280
I want to comes beneath this drug gret, this drug line is going to be responsible for actually drawing

213
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,980
any line that we have, so we need to call in that canvas methods, the canvas methods.

214
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,890
So we are going to have a function that is going to be draw a line.

215
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:12,050
We are going to call this function within our draw side function, which we are yet to create.

216
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:23,089
So draw a line, the parameters are going to be X the zero zero position for X and then the zero position

217
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:30,380
for Y, these are the starting positions X one is going to be ending position for X and Y, one is going

218
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,170
to be ending position for Y as well as color.

219
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,250
So first off, let's pass on the color.

220
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,760
So Conex start stroke's style because there are lines we are just going to call stroke and the color

221
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,920
is going to be the color that we pass in here.

222
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,980
Then we're going to say, let's begin our path.

223
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:57,160
So where the lines should start, the line should start to move to zero and y zero.

224
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,560
What are those points?

225
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,300
We're going to pass them on later.

226
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,020
Where should they go to?

227
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,740
So line two is going to be X one and Y one.

228
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,520
And finally, we are going to say stroke.

229
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,350
Strauch.

230
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:23,150
Perfect, so let's actually go ahead and let's create the draw side function, so I'm going to come

231
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,630
down, I'm going to collapse this function, the squares function square row, all right.

232
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,310
It's collapse these and inside our draw sides.

233
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,860
Inside our square cloths on top of the drawer sides, I'm going to create a function that is going to

234
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,440
withdraw side singular.

235
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,260
Perfect.

236
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,400
So what do we want to do inside this draw site?

237
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,850
Basically, we are checking if the use of the user highlights.

238
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,350
If I hovers on the right side, we want to highlight that.

239
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:08,250
We want to create that line if it is on the left, create left top and the same thing for top and bottom.

240
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,260
So we are going to say switch.

241
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,450
That's passing the site.

242
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,200
And as for this draw site, you can see that it has two arguments.

243
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,470
We need two parameters.

244
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,020
The first one is going to be the highlight.

245
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,560
Which is going to be the side, so I'm going to pass and side here.

246
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,760
The second thing, the second one is going to be color.

247
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,910
So I'm just going to go ahead.

248
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,390
I'm going to pass and color here.

249
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,380
So in know we're switch.

250
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,170
And the first case we want to say if side is the bottom side.

251
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,820
We want to draw a line, right?

252
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,520
And what are going to be the X zero Y zero x one, y one in color, the zero is going to be this star

253
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,090
left.

254
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,100
The Y zero is going to be this dot bottom.

255
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:12,020
The next one is going to be this start, right, and the why one is going to be this bar.

256
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,580
All right, when it hits the bottom side, I have to show it to you so you can really understand it.

257
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:24,440
So when it is the bottom side, for example, for example, this is the bottom side.

258
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,640
The bottom side.

259
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,650
Has your relationship with this done left and then this dot bottom.

260
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,550
This the right.

261
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,400
And then again, the start bottom, right, so the bottom is going to have a distorted bottom, this

262
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,380
the left and this start bottom, this that right.

263
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,430
That's exactly what we are doing here.

264
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,350
This dot bottom, this the left, this dot bottom, this the right.

265
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,100
Perfect.

266
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,440
So after that, we are going to break out of it.

267
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,300
All right, and we are we should also pass on the color.

268
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:06,650
Let's pass on that color, so we are going to repeat this three more times for the remaining three sides.

269
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,660
So if the side is going to be left for the left side, we are going to have this.

270
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,980
The left now left has a relationship with top and their relationship with border.

271
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,460
So this the left, this start top and then again, this the left.

272
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,310
This Darbar, the same thing for the right.

273
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,930
We have drawn a line for the right now, right, has a relationship with the top and the bottom.

274
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,950
So this is right top and then bottom.

275
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,520
Perfect.

276
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,750
So we are going to have this start.

277
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,470
Right.

278
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,230
So first off, let's pass on this top and again, the studd right and the start bottom.

279
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,470
Perfect.

280
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,190
So that is going to be that finally we have this top.

281
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,160
So the top has a relationship with left and right.

282
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,820
We are going to say this, the left and the top.

283
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,910
This dot right.

284
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,140
This top.

285
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,910
Save that, and I don't think we are going to see anything here.

286
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:23,150
We do have an error that says can't access property, semiliterate squares is undefined.

287
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,000
Why is it undefined?

288
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,330
We have defined that hard line.

289
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,640
98 square is undefined.

290
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,580
Let's come.

291
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,620
Let's check it out.

292
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:42,330
So in here, it says online 98, the squares is undefined.

293
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,120
Have we called a redraw squares?

294
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,930
Skewers.

295
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,480
It is the same function.

296
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,310
So why is it undefined?

297
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,350
We have called in our squares right here, right?

298
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:06,700
So if I grab control, collect the squares is there, then we have set for let a row of squares.

299
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,290
Squares is going to be oh, we have not called our new game function.

300
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,890
It's.

301
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:19,260
So on top of that, I'm just going to call the new game function, let's save it and hopefully this

302
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,660
message is going to go away.

303
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,810
Go away.

304
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,590
It is going to say square drawerful, and now it is a different error.

305
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,180
It says Square, the drawerful is not a function.

306
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,870
That's because we have not yet defined it.

307
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,840
It's referring to I believe it's here, this drawerful.

308
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,220
We are going to create that function as well.

309
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,880
So that's that was a good error.

310
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,700
It reminded me of calling the new game function here.

311
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,450
Perfect, so now that we are done with that part, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and

312
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,030
move on.

313
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,040
So the next part is I would like to do something real in this lecture.

314
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:08,040
So what I'm going to do is we are going to create the highlight site function as well.

315
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,610
So let's go ahead.

316
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm going to go on below the grid.

317
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,740
Why perfect in here?

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,130
I'm going to copy that and I'm going to pasted and I'm going to say a highlight highlight grid.

319
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,710
So it's going to be a function highlight.

320
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,830
Oh, it's not going to be a highlight grid.

321
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,280
It's going to be a highlight site for now.

322
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,090
We do have a highlight grid as well.

323
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,980
So highlight site.

324
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,610
They're are going to be parameters X and Y for that.

325
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:58,550
All right, so let's actually go ahead and create this function, so for what this function is actually

326
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:04,150
trying to do is we are trying to highlight the side which is hovered on.

327
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,320
So for this function to actually work, we need a mouse event as well.

328
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,790
And we are going to create that right after we create this function.

329
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:23,320
So don't worry about it, so we have our highlights site, we will have to highlight side functions.

330
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,660
This is one of them, but this is not the function that we will be creating here.

331
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,100
That function is actually going to be a function within this class is going to be a property and method

332
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,530
of the square class.

333
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,370
So I'm going to say highlight side and this is going to be a function expression.

334
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,440
So let's actually go ahead and create that.

335
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:55,940
So first off, we need to calculate the distances to each side, so in here I'm going to pass an X and

336
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,340
Y, how can we calculate that?

337
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,010
So first off, let's call that distance bottom.

338
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,280
So the first one is going to be dist. bottom.

339
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:12,230
The distance bottom is going to be this dot bottom minus the y axis, the Y position, whatever comes

340
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:19,070
after that, we are going to subtract it by wherever the point is and then we are going to have dist

341
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,330
left.

342
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,990
Distance left is going to be our exposition minus the left of that square.

343
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:36,960
Then we are going to have let distance right, the distance right is going to be our right position.

344
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:47,250
Right position minus the X and let's go ahead and let's create the distance stuff as well.

345
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:54,860
So dist. top and that is going to be the Y position minus the top point.

346
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,510
Now we need to have a variable for the closest side.

347
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,210
So I'm going to say distance closest, whichever is closest to where we are pointing.

348
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,570
So for that, how can we grab these the smallest of these?

349
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:19,750
So four, that we have a method that is math dot in math, dot man is going to return the smallest of

350
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,690
office like a set of numbers.

351
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,850
So this is closest and I'm going to pass on this bottom.

352
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:38,000
Dust left, dust right and dust top perfect, so it is going to return the smallest of these and are

353
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:46,470
going to store it inside there and now we want to highlight the closest, the closest site.

354
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,890
But first, we need to check if that is not already selected.

355
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,480
If it is selected, then we do not want to highlight it.

356
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:02,260
So first off, we are going to say that if the closest, the closest distance is equal to the bottom

357
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:09,050
distance, we want to highlight it, but we need to check that that is not already being selected.

358
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:21,190
So if this and also this dot side bottom dot selected is false, if if it is not selected and the it

359
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:28,960
is closer to bottom, we want to highlight that and we are going to say this DOT highlight is going

360
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,460
to be able to decide that object that we have created inside that bottom.

361
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:44,050
So we have created this and I'm going to copy this and we are going to repeat it for all the other sites

362
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,580
so else.

363
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,790
And we're going to do it one by one.

364
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:55,770
So I have distance closest is equal to the left, is equal to the distance left and the side.

365
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,970
The left is not selected, so side left is not selected.

366
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,950
Then what it is that we want to do, we want to highlight the side left.

367
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,360
Very simple.

368
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,780
Now let's put that here again.

369
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,250
If the distance closest is equal to the right.

370
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:26,740
And that right part has not been selected already, so side right has not been already selected.

371
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,230
We want to highlight which part the right part.

372
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:43,410
And finally, for the top, if distance closest is equal to the top top and also it is not selected,

373
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,970
we want to highlight it.

374
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,680
So let's say top.

375
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,120
We want to highlight it.

376
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:57,520
And after I if after all of this, it doesn't do anything, it doesn't return anything, what do we

377
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,050
want to do?

378
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:04,000
We want to return and return this dot to highlight.

379
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,950
Perfect, so now with this, let's go ahead and let's actually check so our grid is gone.

380
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,180
Let's see what this I think this is the draw fill function is not a function and it is a key.

381
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,260
It is going to keep repeating it until we go ahead and we draw that.

382
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,590
And I know this is not going to work because we have not actually created the mouse event.

383
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,600
We need to create that mouse event.

384
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,020
We need to call this highlights site somewhere for this to work.

385
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,380
So this was the part one of actually highlighting sites.

386
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,140
And in the next part, we will go ahead and we are going to complete this highlighting of the sides.

387
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,690
So see you guys then.
