00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.020
Hi, everyone, in this election, we will be drawing the walls and the panel, all right.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.830
So whenever we create the functions, until we get back to them, I'm just going to go ahead and collapse

3
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.060
them.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.290
You can just click on this arrow next to the functions, and I'm just going to go ahead and collapse

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.200
it because we'll be having a lot of functions.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.570
So let's grab the dry drawls function.

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.950
So what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create that.

8
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.180
OK, so this is Draw Watts.

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.500
And first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable for half of the wall because

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.080
the wall is going to be like half of the wall is going to be on the canvas and half of it is going to

11
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.150
be off the canvas.

12
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.590
So we are going to have half wall and that's a wall time, zero point five.

13
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.990
This is going to give us half of the width of the wall.

14
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:08.200
And let's grab our canvas context and let's say a line with let's set it to wall.

15
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.490
And that's going to be the width of that line.

16
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.630
What is the stroke style?

17
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.570
So canvas start stroke style is going to be the color of the wall that we have.

18
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.310
You can't change any color that you want.

19
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.990
It's not going to be any problem.

20
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.110
So let's come down here.

21
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.870
Let's grab our canvas context and begin path.

22
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.310
So right after that.

23
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020
So what we are going to do is where is where is it going to be the starting point?

24
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.070
The starting point is going to be the bottom left corner of the of the canvas.

25
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.240
So we are going to say canvas contacts start move to.

26
00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.970
All right, and it is going to be the half warns starting point and the height of the canvas, this

27
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.280
is going to be the X and the Y positions for the starting point and where the line is going to go to.

28
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.870
So the line.

29
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.250
Let's see.

30
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.830
So that line.

31
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.140
OK, so we are going to go to the height of the wall first.

32
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.110
So we are going to have four for the X and for the way we are going to have half wall as well.

33
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.020
So because we are going to have three walls.

34
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.670
What we are going to do is we are going to have three line twos, so the first line two is going to

35
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.010
go to top left.

36
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.490
The second one should go to the top right.

37
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.450
So the right part is the farthest part, which is the width of the canvas.

38
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.930
But we don't want the wall to appear after the width.

39
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.340
So we should, from the width, subtract the width of the wall.

40
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.830
Right.

41
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.850
The next point is going to be a bottom right, which is the point at which we have our height.

42
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.610
So.

43
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.770
So we have so we have our move to we have our this is our first OK.

44
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.120
I shouldn't have written it there, OK, I should put it right here.

45
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.970
So this is going to be with we should subtract from the with half of the wall and then the thickness

46
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.420
or the Y position is going to be half of the wall.

47
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.820
And after that the Y position is going to be the height.

48
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.700
Right, so let's grab that, let's set it to height and the exposition of the wall is going to be again

49
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.850
with minus that half of the wall.

50
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.700
Perfect.

51
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.960
So let's save it.

52
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.060
And for us to be able to see this, let's go ahead and let's actually draw.

53
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.180
That's a stroke.

54
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.500
We need to call this function as well.

55
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.080
So I'm going to come inside this play game and right down there, I'm going to call the dry walls function

56
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.930
and let's save it.

57
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.430
So if I come here, you can see that we have our walls and if we decrease the width of the screen,

58
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.980
the width of the walls is going to get decreased.

59
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.930
That's why we have passed in with and height in here, because we actually want these to be responsive.

60
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.370
So they draw draw walls, function is completed as well.

61
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.950
And I'm going to go ahead and collapse that function right after that.

62
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.570
What I want to do is.

63
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:45.330
I want to go ahead and actually create a function that is called the new game function, right?

64
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.010
OK, so the new game function, I'm just going to go ahead and create it on below this dry walls function

65
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.180
and this function is responsible for actually creating a new game for us.

66
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.690
And inside this function is where we will be instantiating the paddle class.

67
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.130
So I'm going to call this new game.

68
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:25.390
Perfect and in here, I'm going to go ahead and let's see if we have have we we have a height with and

69
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.150
ball we have why have we have not declared the paddle?

70
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.190
So what should I why should it.

71
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.030
What should I do here is I'm going to go to top.

72
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.240
So beneath this dimension's.

73
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.230
Right, so you know what, I'm just going to I'm going to do this first here and then we are going to

74
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.760
go and create that instantiate that panel.

75
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:05.060
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say in initializing initializing the panel.

76
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.090
Part of.

77
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:18.310
The paddle ball, the paddle and ball classes, we are going to initialize them right here, come on

78
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.440
and let's see, let's say paddle and then we will have our ball.

79
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.190
Now for the touch event, what we would have is we need to provide a touch position as well.

80
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.560
I'm just going to go ahead and provide it, even though we are going to cover it way later.

81
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.950
And I'm going to call this touch location.

82
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.830
So you know that in your mind that we will be making this responsive.

83
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.020
So let's come down here.

84
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.910
So now let's go ahead and let's instantiate this paddle.

85
00:06:51.340 --> 00:07:01.150
All right, so the panel is going to be new panel and we are going to pass on the panel with the wall

86
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:10.780
and the panel spect these are necessary for us to be able to create that class that we will be in,

87
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.270
just like in just a few seconds.

88
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.200
Right.

89
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.020
So we have created this one as well.

90
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.510
All right.

91
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:28.240
So on top of these function calls, I'm going to come here and I'm going to say the panel class.

92
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.310
All right, and we are going to create a class and we're going to call it panel perfect and this is

93
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:47.720
going to receive a constructor and within the constructor as we pass parameters for which we have arguments.

94
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.350
So we have arguments for panel with wall and panel speech.

95
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.620
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to write parallel with and I'm going to say paddle this.

96
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.460
The wall is actually going to be the paddles height.

97
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.440
And then we have the panels with sorry, speed, paddle speed.

98
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.740
Perfect.

99
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:15.260
So you're going to say this dot now what is going to be the width of the paddle?

100
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:22.210
The width of the paddle is going to be paddle with times the width of the screen.

101
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.060
Perfect.

102
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.570
Then we are going to have the height.

103
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.070
What is going to be the height of the paddle?

104
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.049
The height of the paddle is going to be the paddle height divided by two.

105
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.830
The reason that I divided by two was because it was big.

106
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.530
So I just wanted to reduce that.

107
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.169
What is going to be the exposition of the paddle whenever the new game is called?

108
00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:50.960
Whenever we have a new game, the width of the paddle is going to be at the middle point horizontally.

109
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.440
So canvas element dot with metal point is going to be divided by two.

110
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:06.410
The the Y position is going to be right at the bottom, but we are going to give it some distance from

111
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.900
the bottom.

112
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.720
So if I come here, you can see that it is detached from the screen somewhat.

113
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.080
So we are going to say canvas.

114
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.230
So bottom of the page is going to be canvas elements, height.

115
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.240
And from that, we are going to reduce the height of the paddle three times the height.

116
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.470
So it is going to be detached from the bottom of the screen by three times the height of the paddle.

117
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:39.240
The speed at which the paddle is going to move is going to be paddle, paddle, speed.

118
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.390
Perfect, so we have.

119
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.850
The paddle speed times the width.

120
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.780
Perfect.

121
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.050
All right.

122
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:55.770
And finally, the X, because the paddles just moving from one side to the next side, we're just going

123
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.780
to have an X velocity and we are going to set it to zero.

124
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.930
Perfect, so we have created this now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to

125
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.110
create a drop panel function.

126
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:23.420
All right, so underneath this draw background, but on top of the draw was what I'm going to do is

127
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:29.380
right here, I'm going to grab this comment and I'm going to put it there and I'm going to say draw,

128
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:29.990
paddle.

129
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.630
And you know, where we are going to call it.

130
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.980
We are going to call it within our game loop.

131
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:46.070
So function we have drawn the background knowledge to draw the paddle, draw, paddle and what do we

132
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:46.520
have here?

133
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:52.190
So what we are going to do is first I'm going to give the paddle a color.

134
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:58.220
So Conn's Conex Times Phil style.

135
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:06.870
It is going to be the color purple that we have created perfect, so we want to create a basically a

136
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.550
rectangle.

137
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.010
So context to fill the RECHT, what is the exposition?

138
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.790
Because I wanted it to be exactly in the center.

139
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.090
So it is going to be part of that X right.

140
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:28.230
Minus now, if I wanted to be, I want the center of the panel to be exactly at the center of the page

141
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.030
horizontally.

142
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.450
So I want half of the panel to be on one side and half on the other side.

143
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:41.400
That's why we are going to say panel dot with time zero point five or if this makes you feel better,

144
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:46.520
I'm just going to say divide it by two, but I'm just going to say zero point five anyway.

145
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.580
So if you say zero point divided by two zero point five doesn't really matter.

146
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.370
And in case you just have to take care of the multiplication and the division part.

147
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.300
So the paddles y position is going to act in the same way.

148
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.320
So we are going to have the paddles height divided by two.

149
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.080
I'm going to do this divided by two.

150
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:13.410
Then the paddles with is going to be the paddle w the paddles height is going to be the paddle a.

151
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:25.100
Perfect, so now let's go ahead and let's call the panel, so below this drawback, draw walls.

152
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:35.110
I'm going to call this a draw panel function, let's save it, let's come here and we see all this cannot

153
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.130
property X of Padel is undefined.

154
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.950
Why is that undefined line fifty 54.

155
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.870
Uh, Padel ex.

156
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.660
We have we have, said Padel.

157
00:12:49.620 --> 00:13:00.780
And we have this X is canvas element, so we do have we have defined it right and I'm not sure why is

158
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.070
it not grabbing it?

159
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.920
It should it should get it so.

160
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:13.890
So I think the reason that this is not working is because we are not actually instantiating this panel,

161
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.590
the reason for that is we are not calling this new game.

162
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.420
So I'm just going to come down here and I'm going to call the new game.

163
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.570
Of course, we are going to call it in some other place and we are going to come and this one out.

164
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.220
But for the purposes of this lecture, I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to call it and this

165
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.650
is you can see it's really overworking.

166
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:38.750
So I'm just going to close that and I'm going to open this and let's open that up.

167
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.890
Let's see what else is the problem.

168
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:48.090
So now we have called that a panel is not a constructor type type error.

169
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.250
So where is it?

170
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:58.250
It says that, come on, it says that on the line 76.

171
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.920
So let me just make this paddle is not a constructor.

172
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:11.100
Seventy six, so online 76, we have our panel.

173
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.460
Oh, this is lower case.

174
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:19.070
You can see that even with one thing, lower case, you're going to have like an array of errors.

175
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.970
And there we go.

176
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.110
This is our panel.

177
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.480
We have successfully drawn the panel and well, basically.

178
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:33.620
And if you just click there and you move it, it is not moving because we have not specified those events

179
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.040
yet.

180
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.060
Right.

181
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.430
So we have successfully drawn the panel.

182
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.180
And that's it for this lecture.

183
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.760
See you guys in the next one.
