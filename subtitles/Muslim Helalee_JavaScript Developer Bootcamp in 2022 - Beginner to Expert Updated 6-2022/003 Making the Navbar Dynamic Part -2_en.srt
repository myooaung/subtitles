00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,170
Hi, everyone, welcome to the second lecture where we make or no effect dynamic.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,250
All right.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,400
So we have successfully grabbed the U.S. class name that we are on and we have started inside this variable.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,360
We are going to create another variable called Active Link.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,800
I'm just going to call it active link because whenever we are on that active link.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,450
So first off, let's go ahead and let's grab the active link.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,540
We are going to change the background image of it.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,730
We are going to say the background color of it.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,190
Sorry, we are going to say so.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,640
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do back Tick's here.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,010
This is the good thing about queries that actually can do anything.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,170
And we are going to grab the data dash page attribute, but the value for it is going to Krampf is going

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,330
to come from our class and we are going to store it dynamically.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,290
You're going to say Klusener, the reason that we store it dynamically is.

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,550
OK, so I should pass in that one as well.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,510
The reason that we story dynamically is because whenever we're scrolling up and down, we do not want

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,770
a hard code which section it is that the user is scrolling.

18
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,660
For example, you have created a website, and whenever the user scrolls down, you're not going to

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,110
go to the user's home and you're going to recode your website for each individual user.

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,220
What you're going to do is you're going to make sure that it acts dynamically.

21
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,570
It is functional on its own.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,890
And this data page attribute actually comes from our HDMI from right here.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,720
So the data page has home about services and contact.

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,070
So where are these going to come from?

25
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,960
From Klusener.

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,130
So the class name comes from entry, the target date class name.

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,330
So if we are on the home, we are going to grab the class name is going to be home and we are going

28
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,500
to pass it right here.

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,040
And this data page is going to be home when we are on the about the data page is going to be about services

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,910
or contact.

31
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,669
It's going to act in the same way for all of them.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,700
Right.

33
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,100
So after that, what I want to do is I want to create another constant and I'm going to call it aliment.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,090
I meant index and I'm going to store it in and I'm going to say basically we are going to store some

35
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,190
information in here.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,820
So now we are going to grab the index of that element that we are on.

37
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,780
And that element is we are going to grab the index again from our e-mail, and that is data index.

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,820
And you guys can see that the index in this area, we don't have indices starting from zero.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,250
They start from one.

40
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,610
Right.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,730
But in JavaScript, they start from zero because we are going to use this data index in JavaScript.

42
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,930
That's why we have given in zero right away.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,780
All right.

44
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,820
So it starts from zero, even though we have four sections, the length of the section is one greater

45
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,690
than the last index.

46
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,490
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say entry.

47
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,670
The target now from there from the target.

48
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,400
What I want to do is I want to get an attribute, get attribute.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,240
We do have this attribute inside the target as well.

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,460
And what is the attribute that we want to get?

51
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,670
It is the data Dasch index.

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,620
We want to grab that that attribute.

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,100
All right.

54
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,540
So now what I want to do is we are going to know we are going to grab the coordinates as well.

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,710
And I told you about the bounden client rectangle or binding contract that we are going to use in here

56
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,850
and also in our.

57
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:57,500
Gallery carrousel, because we want to make sure which positions exactly belong to our sections, so

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:05,540
to avoid the confusion that if we are, for example, on our first section, we don't want this background

59
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,960
color to go to the content.

60
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:15,500
We want to make sure exactly where we are in the page and what are the exact coordinates of our section.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,560
And then we are going to pass it inside the JavaScript to make sure that JavaScript grabs the exact

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,390
coordinates of that section.

63
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,060
So we are going to say active link, dot, get bounding client Recht.

64
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,290
This is going to grab all the coordinates of top bottom height and with top and left all the information

65
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,800
that we want to grab when it comes to positioning is going to be stored inside the cordon and it's very

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,400
variable.

67
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,940
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a directions object because we are going to store

68
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,080
key value pairs.

69
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,670
So I'm going to set height.

70
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,990
So the height is going to be equal to the coordinates that height.

71
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,120
And if you remember, coordinates is actually our target bounding client direct.

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,620
And the height actually refers to this get bounding client.

73
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:06,980
Right.

74
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:13,790
We are going to say with so the width in the directions, it has to come from a circuit bound and client

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,580
rucked as well.

76
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,870
So we are going to say coordinates with.

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,380
We are just making sure that we are selecting all the edges of that section and that section is in the

78
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:34,650
correct spot and where we want it to be and when the section is in the currents is in the correct spot.

79
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,640
We want to apply a background color to the novel length associated with that section.

80
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,200
So this is the part where I told you guys that it is it's not difficult, it's easy, but it's a bit

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,810
trickier to do.

82
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,810
You know, we we have tricky things and we have difficult things.

83
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,590
This is not difficult.

84
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,490
This is super easy, barely an inconvenience.

85
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,610
But this is tricky.

86
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,780
You should know what you what you are doing.

87
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,770
All right.

88
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,490
So now we have successfully grabbed on the directions.

89
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:12,670
So the last thing that I hear that I want to do is I want to create an if statement because I want to

90
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,620
control the flow of the document.

91
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,370
All right, so if.

92
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:30,240
And create the structure of the if statement, if entry does not enter, if entry is intersecting,

93
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:39,240
is intersecting, if the entry is intersecting, which I showed you, which disvalue was true, whenever

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,970
we we we went up and down.

95
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,850
So let me comment that in.

96
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,500
And I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to leave it there.

97
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,500
So whenever we go up and down, let me try this.

98
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,600
So if I go up, we are going to get this.

99
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,490
We are going to get this whenever the end is intersecting entries.

100
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:56,840
True.

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,940
So if I come here, we are going to see is intersecting.

102
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,610
Well, this is false in this case.

103
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,080
But if I come here, this one should be true.

104
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,010
This is true.

105
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:16,140
Whenever we get that with whenever we get that section, the intersection, sexting is going to be true.

106
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,440
But when we don't get it, it is going to be false.

107
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,740
So if I come here now, this should be true and this is true.

108
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,740
So if I go to the top and grab the final one for this one, it is true.

109
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,400
But if I grab the previous one now, this belongs to our services in here.

110
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,760
Let's go ahead and let CNN and then here it says is intersecting is false because this does not belong

111
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,250
to our home section.

112
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,510
It belongs to the about section.

113
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,110
All right.

114
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:54,330
Or the service, whatever section that we are not on that is going to have and is intersecting property

115
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,890
are false.

116
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,160
You know what?

117
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm just going to go over this concept one more time, and I feel like this is a bit confusing.

118
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:09,380
So whenever we scroll, we get some sort of date, right, so whenever we grab that data, we want to

119
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,430
make sure that we grab that section's data and whenever we don't grab that section's data, we don't

120
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,480
want to run the code.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,260
So whenever the section data belongs to the home section home, we want to we want to run that code.

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,460
So if I go ahead, come down, we are going to see another one.

123
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,090
And when it is intersecting in here, it says intersecting.

124
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,380
Whenever it is intersecting, we want to apply that background color.

125
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,990
That's how simple it is.

126
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,539
So we are going to say Tranz.

127
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,390
That style, that background color.

128
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,760
Oops.

129
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,480
What is that dot background?

130
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,950
Background, you're going to make me type, aren't you?

131
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:02,100
So we are going to say that style, that background color, well, actually, we are not going to say

132
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,860
background color.

133
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,900
We're just going to set a property to it because we have already defined the background colors here.

134
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,420
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say set property.

135
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,330
This is another very useful, useful method with.

136
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,500
With the CSI style, right, so in here, we are going to pass in a height, so whenever the trans style

137
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,770
has a height, what do we want?

138
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,330
Where do we want the property value come from?

139
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,790
So this method has two arguments.

140
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,640
The first argument is going to be the property name.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,700
Like in here we have a position as a property name and each property name has a value like this.

142
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,110
Sticky is a value for this position name.

143
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,860
So what what do we want the height to be?

144
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,440
We want to provide back to because we want to grab the high dynamically.

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,180
So we are going to say directions.

146
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,400
Where do we want to grab the height?

147
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,640
We want to say that height now heights they usually have BEXELL.

148
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,270
So we are going to add the pixel as well.

149
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,680
Let's comment out this concept of log, and I'm going to provide three more, because we are going to

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:21,110
change these two to eidetic with these two to top and these two to the left.

151
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:33,580
Right, and now, finally, whenever we grab the proper place for the sections and for our trans transition

152
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,390
background.

153
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,960
We want to grab the chance and we are going to say color and now we are going to say background.

154
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,960
Back.

155
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:52,260
Ground colour, we are going to set it equal to our array, whatever it is, gradients.

156
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,540
Aliment index aliment, come on, buddy element.

157
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,990
Aliment index, let's save it and now it says, cannot set property background, color of undefined

158
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,410
Tranz background, color gradients.

159
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,120
So let's click here.

160
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
It says entry.

161
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,750
This is undefined.

162
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,010
So we do have a bunch of errors.

163
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:24,230
We have actually a radar for each anonymous and we have kind of set off undefined.

164
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,570
So if I click there, it says Gradients Element Index.

165
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,110
Undefined, so what is undefined in this one?

166
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,540
Background, color.

167
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,070
Of undefined.

168
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,810
All right, this isn't tape error, and then we have a radar for each and then we have intersection

169
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,630
Observer Danowski 21.

170
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,210
So I think all of these errors are going to be resolved with only one of them if you resolve one of

171
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:52,430
them.

172
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,990
So in here we have gradients, we have our chance.

173
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,020
This is this is the problem because we have not tapped into the world of the style.

174
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,090
We have simply said color.

175
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,250
We should write style.

176
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,810
And when we save it now, all the errors are gone.

177
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,700
So now when I reload it and if I come down, you guys can see we still do not get our effect right.

178
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:24,660
All right, so let me make this window a bit smaller and this one smaller as well.

179
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,670
OK, this is not something that we want.

180
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,360
So let's go full screen and let's close this.

181
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,860
We do see that the colors, they change, but the position is incorrect.

182
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,330
This is not where the colors should change.

183
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,530
And now you can see.

184
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,330
So this is the home color.

185
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,440
Keep in mind the size of these rectangles.

186
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,670
So if I come down when we get to the about, because home about are about the same size, the rectangles

187
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,040
of the set are the same size.

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,200
But when we come to the services, because services is a bigger word than about this rectangle just

189
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,960
got bigger and then it gets a bit smaller because of the content.

190
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,080
I hope you can see that.

191
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,600
So we are grabbing that, but the position is incorrect.

192
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:16,280
So this position we have height coordinates, height with coordinates, with top coordinates, top and

193
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,340
left, with coordinates left.

194
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:26,030
We have height coordinates, directions, height with directions, with pixels, top directions top.

195
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,240
And we have the left directions height.

196
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,080
Why is it why is this one height.

197
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,880
I mean when we copy that we forgot to change it, so let's save it.

198
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,300
And now it is working.

199
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,020
So if I go ahead and if I come down to the 70 percent, we should be able to see that it switches to

200
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,560
the about.

201
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,830
And if we come down and switches to services and then contact.

202
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,980
So basically, we are done with our project and our chapter and see you guys in the next chapter.
