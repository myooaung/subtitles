00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.200
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will be implementing the power ups.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.800
First off, let's go ahead and let's set up the power ups inside our game parameters.

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.660
I'm going to create a constant and I'm going to call it power up.

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.420
So is power up is up.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.570
So pup underscore chance.

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.780
And we are going to set it to one first, at first, and this is the probability of a power of purbrick

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.210
hit.

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.740
You know what?

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.140
I'm just going to copy it from here, the comment, and I'm going to put it right there.

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.390
So the next thing that I'm going to create is going to be the speed at which the power up moves and

11
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.700
we're going to put a zero point one five and a right.

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.540
And then we are going to get a power, a bonus pop and bonus.

13
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.610
And the bonuses, for example, whenever you have it, or you already have a power up.

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.240
And it is going to be this is the score that you're going to get if you get a second power up in a row.

15
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.540
So I'm going to show you the bonus.

16
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.210
So let's reduce the audio.

17
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.730
So there you can see that we have a super power up.

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.850
So if I get it now, the ball is going to kill all of those.

19
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.400
And OK, I couldn't show you show it to you there.

20
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.580
So I hope hopefully I can show it to you now.

21
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.950
So let's see.

22
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.580
Let's wait.

23
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.900
I'm going to reset the game.

24
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.910
So let's go ahead.

25
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.020
I should get a sticky first so I can show you what what actually I mean, whenever you hit, the score

26
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.760
is going to get increased by 50.

27
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.410
So the chance is 10 percent like there is a 10 percent chance that whenever you had to break a brick,

28
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.450
you're going to get a power up.

29
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.280
So out of an average out of 10 bricks, one of them is going to have a power up inside of them.

30
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.320
So that's what the zero point one means.

31
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.300
Perfect.

32
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.450
So give me a power up, there is a chance I mean, that is just chance.

33
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.760
Got three there and, uh.

34
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.090
There we go.

35
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.390
So this should give me an extra life.

36
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.270
Oh, I couldn't get it if.

37
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.890
I can say that is bad luck.

38
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.490
I am I have to get one so I can show you what I mean by that.

39
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.470
Except for the life, the life is not going to do that, OK?

40
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.300
Now the speed is bigger, so the speed has increased.

41
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.430
So you should be able to get.

42
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.520
Something you now the life, it doesn't matter how many lives you get, how many life power ups it is

43
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.260
going to just give you.

44
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.320
So now I have gotten the extension power up and I have to finish my other sentence.

45
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.230
It doesn't matter how many life paragraphs you get as when you get the balls are going to increase the

46
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.160
number of balls for the rest of the three.

47
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:34.150
If you get like two power ups in a row, for example, I have gotten the extension power up.

48
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.530
If I get the extension power up again, the width of the power is not going to get increased.

49
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.370
But as a bonus, I'm going to get 50 points.

50
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.550
All right.

51
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.650
That that is what the bonus actually means.

52
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.730
I'm going to show it to you.

53
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.750
So I'm sure I will find another one.

54
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.910
The speed is increase, so it should be close.

55
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.280
I'm not doing a home run.

56
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.320
Should the home run?

57
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.230
Here we go.

58
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.170
That is the super if I get that, then everything is going to be messed up, so I'm not going to get

59
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.280
it.

60
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.850
I could get this sticky.

61
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.200
Sticky is good, actually.

62
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.440
So I'm not going to get the super or if I ever have gotten it, then I would have gotten this one as

63
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.649
well.

64
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.340
But I'm not.

65
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.130
Because I have to show it to you how the 50 years is increasing.

66
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.350
I probably should have increased the chance, so if I couldn't get it in this round, I'm going to increase

67
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.070
the chance.

68
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.990
Boy, so all super.

69
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.990
Super Bowls.

70
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.560
Oh, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to increase the chance, so power of chance, I'm going to

71
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.150
set it to one which is 100 percent so in on each brick, you are going to get that power.

72
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.710
So I've gotten one extension right now.

73
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.640
If I get another one, except for the life, I should get 50 points.

74
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.800
So you can see I've gotten one life, and if I get the second one, the score is not going to increase,

75
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.690
but the ball is going to increase.

76
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.470
Oh, there are so many lives like that.

77
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.920
So the life is seven out of three, so there we go.

78
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.320
This is a sticky one, sticky, and now I'm going to grab that.

79
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.820
And if I do this, it is going to destroy all of them.

80
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.240
And I already have one sticky, right.

81
00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.150
So if I grab another sticky, the score should go from whatever it is to something like big.

82
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.720
So I'm just going to hit that.

83
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.130
So this is a.

84
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.660
So we have seventy-one.

85
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.470
It should be one to any one.

86
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.260
There we go.

87
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.650
This is what I was looking for and it took me so long.

88
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.280
Perfect.

89
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.980
So that's that's what we say, by the chance, and the bonus.

90
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:28.150
OK, and just I just had to show it to you, so let's go ahead and let's actually create a an object.

91
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:35.770
So I'm going to come on beneath our direction and in here I'm going to say consed pop type.

92
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.540
So this is going to be our object.

93
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.580
Inside this object, we have X 10 Schenn.

94
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.150
We have extension for the extension.

95
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.170
I'm going to create another small object.

96
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.670
The extension is going to have our power ups is going to have a property of color and a property of

97
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.360
symbol.

98
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.640
You can change the color and you can change the symbol as well.

99
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.770
So for the extension, I'm going to put in an equality sign.

100
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.230
Next up, we have our life.

101
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.920
So for life, we are going to put it to Korrell.

102
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.730
Coral, and it is going to be a plus sign.

103
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.420
Perfect, then we are going to have oh we should add comis here.

104
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.780
Perfect.

105
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:34.710
This is an object and then we have sticky, so for this sticky, the color is going to be light green,

106
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:44.250
so light see green, you can't change the color and the symbol is going to be Telx Day or Squiggly Little

107
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.590
Tilde or whatever.

108
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.700
And then we have our super.

109
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.760
Now, this is the superman of this, the all of these balls.

110
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.480
And this is going to be hot pink.

111
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.540
And finally this the symbol is going to be.

112
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.780
Yes, of course.

113
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.960
What else could be the symbol?

114
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.380
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead to our new ball function.

115
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.640
Where is our new Kneubuhl function?

116
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.190
Have we even created.

117
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.770
There we go.

118
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.100
So in here, what I want to do is I want to reset after each game.

119
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.200
I want to reset all of the power ups.

120
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:30.350
So resetting the power ups after each game.

121
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.360
Perfect.

122
00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.730
OK, so.

123
00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:42.100
Power ups, so I'm going to grab the pump extension, which we have created before in a few in back

124
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.650
a few lectures, then I'm going to grab the pump sticky and I'm going to say false.

125
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.710
And then we are going to grab the pump super and set it to false.

126
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:06.240
All right, after that, let's go up to our new level and in here I'm going to create a Pops array.

127
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.070
I'm going to initialize it.

128
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.080
So have we created that here?

129
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.360
So we have.

130
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.920
We should create that array first here, so I'm going to create it so this is going to contain all of

131
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:27.830
our power ups or pops, and then we are going to come to our is our where were we?

132
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.130
We were inside our new level.

133
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.910
So this is new level.

134
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:40.920
So on top of there, what I want to do is I want to let's let's I'm going to come in to try to reset

135
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:48.000
the Pops array, reset the pops to an empty array.

136
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.610
OK, so Pops is equal to an empty array.

137
00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:01.190
And then let's go ahead and let's create the class, so underneath everything, I'm going to create

138
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.780
the power up class.

139
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:10.360
So in here I'm going to say the the power of class.

140
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.720
So it is going to be class power up.

141
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.240
Perfect.

142
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:23.020
Are going to have a constructor X Y size and the type.

143
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.170
Perfect.

144
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:31.580
So we are going to have this study is going to be equal to size because basically we want our power

145
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.930
ups to be squares, so the height and the width are going to be equal.

146
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.740
So size is going to be height is also going to be size.

147
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.480
The exposition is going to be equal to X.

148
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.710
This Y is going to be equal to Y.

149
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:56.310
This type of the power up is going to be able to type and finally this.

150
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:03.700
Now, what do the how do the power ups they travel they travel from top to bottom, say only they have

151
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.470
only one worldwide velocity.

152
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.590
So it is going to be pop speed times the height.

153
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:18.130
So the larger the height, the faster they move, the faster the speed, the smaller the height, the

154
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.180
slower the speed.

155
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.240
That's exactly what we want.

156
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.740
So we have done that as well.

157
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:30.640
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into our bricks because that's where the power ups are

158
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.720
going to originate from and we are going to create power ups.

159
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.560
So let's go ahead and let's go to our update.

160
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.410
Bricks function inside the update.

161
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.380
Bricks function right after this if statement.

162
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.110
And I'm going to say creating a pump or a power up.

163
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.140
So now everything, all of these power ups, they're going to be created randomly.

164
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.150
So we are going to say math that.

165
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:13.070
Random and if math, the random is less than or equal to the pop chance, if it is less than or equal

166
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.090
to that not, what do we want to do?

167
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:22.340
First off, let's grab the power UPS exposition and we are going to grab our bricks and we're going

168
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.290
to pass and I and J.

169
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.210
Dot left.

170
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.870
Plus, I'm going to copy this bricks.

171
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:38.950
You are going to repeated many times, plus the bricks with times to break with divided by two.

172
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.870
So each of the power ups, they're going to originate from the center of the brick horizontally.

173
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.770
We are going to say that vertically as well.

174
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:58.470
So this is going to be palp, hurry, Lokey, hurry, Lokey.

175
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:04.600
All right, and this is going to be Pop Verrity Lokey.

176
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:14.830
OK, I know it's Lucy, but I'm going to say Lokey, so for the vertical, we are going to say BRICS

177
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.730
top.

178
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:24.830
So let's put a top plus the BRICS high to half of the BRICS, right, so they should originate from

179
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.320
the center right.

180
00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.610
And let us grab the size of the leather, specify that.

181
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:41.060
So I'm going to print put in our BRICS array and the size is going to be the size of the BRICS with

182
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.410
time zero point four.

183
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:49.160
This is just the size and we are going to grab the reason that we are using these BRICS locations is

184
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.940
because whenever the screen is bigger or smaller, the power, for example, if the screen is this small,

185
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.370
we don't want the power ups.

186
00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.490
When you hit this screen, we don't want the power of to show up here.

187
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.930
We want the power of to shop wherever that BRIC has been hit.

188
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.570
It doesn't matter what the screen sizes.

189
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:18.190
So now let's go ahead and let's say the key, first off, I'm going to say power of keys and this is

190
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.350
the object that we have created on top.

191
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.870
And you know that we have an object function, which is called object, ironically.

192
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.640
And it is going to we have talked about object that keys values in that.

193
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.310
And we never used it in a real world context.

194
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:39.910
This is the first time that we are using it and then we are going to pass in our type and each individual

195
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:46.600
key is going to be called to pick keys, keys.

196
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:56.050
And from there we need to grab somehow one of those power ups, one of the types randomly.

197
00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:04.410
So we are going to say math dot floor to give us a whole integer and we are going to say math are random.

198
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.720
Let's open up brackets, times, the keys, the length.

199
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:19.450
So as many times as there are as many items as there are or as many keys as there are in that object,

200
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.080
that many random numbers you're going to get.

201
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.930
What is this?

202
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.360
All right, so this is the reason that I'm doing it this way is because it is dynamic.

203
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:35.370
So in case now you have four and you're going to get four random numbers for random turns in case you

204
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:41.580
want to add, for example, six more power ups than the pub type is going to have and is going to contain

205
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.300
10 keys for each of the keys.

206
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:52.270
You're going to randomize the lock, randomize the selection of each of these power ups.

207
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.780
So this has created dynamically.

208
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.940
You have to keep this in mind that whenever you do something, whenever you do some sort of code, you

209
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:05.310
need to keep in mind the maintainability of that code and not in this case.

210
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.430
It is not called maintenance.

211
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.550
It is called scalability.

212
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:15.450
It means that how that code can be scaled up, you can see that with only changing one parameter, we

213
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.140
can easily change the number of columns, the number of breaks.

214
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.260
We can change the gap.

215
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.850
That's why we create all the game parameters.

216
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.520
If you change any of these, you can change basically the entire game.

217
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:28.940
That's a good thing.

218
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.570
That is called scalability.

219
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.490
And you need to keep that in mind whenever you are creating your applications.

220
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:41.120
So we are going to grab the pups array and we are going to push to it a new power up.

221
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:46.620
This is where our power of class is coming, the X, so we need to pass an X.

222
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.660
It is saying it right here.

223
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.690
So if you listen to Vas code, it is going to teach you everything that you need.

224
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.980
So it is going to tell you what this power up is going to require.

225
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.610
It is going to require an X location, which is going to be.

226
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.520
And then you can see the Y is underlined.

227
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:10.910
So P, y and then size, which is going to be the P size and then the power of type.

228
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.960
So in the power up you are just going to pass and the pecky whichever key that may be.

229
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.760
So we are done with this one as well.

230
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.760
So let's go ahead and let's actually draw our power ups.

231
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.430
So I'm going to come up to our two here.

232
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.010
All right.

233
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.370
And in here we are going to draw them.

234
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.590
So right underneath that, I'm going to say draw pups.

235
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:45.650
And where should we draw them so under the panel, so where is our draw Padel right underneath here.

236
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.020
Let's go ahead and draw them.

237
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.990
So draw pops function.

238
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.760
Now, the function name is dropoffs.

239
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.140
Perfect.

240
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.650
No parameter and let's see what we want to do here.

241
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.180
So we want to basically draw squares, right?

242
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.510
So first off, we need to provide it now because the squares, they are hollow.

243
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.020
They just have a line through them.

244
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:21.210
So we are just going to say context line with a line, not throw them around them.

245
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:27.150
But we are going to say the line should be telling Wall Times zero point two.

246
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.550
And if the wall is bigger, those power ups are going to be bigger.

247
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.570
If the wall is smaller, the power ups are going to be smaller.

248
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.070
I'm going to increase it to four.

249
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.780
Right.

250
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.850
And we are going to see what this is going to give us.

251
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.560
So now we are going to iterate over that array of pups that we just populate it.

252
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:52.140
And then for each of the iterations, we are going to create a pup or a power up.

253
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.850
So for Aulet.

254
00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:04.970
Let pop of pups array, and each time we are going to create one pop, so Conex start Phil style.

255
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.920
So it is this is the loop variable, pop type, dot color.

256
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:15.770
So this is going to be the color and then we have a stroke as well.

257
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.100
So that stroke style.

258
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:28.500
And we have a pop dot, whichever type it is, dot color as well.

259
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.970
So for the stroke style, we are going to have the same color.

260
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:38.130
Then let's call the context and we are going to say stroke rect.

261
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:46.390
All right, and in here, so first off, we are going to pass and the exposition, the exposition is

262
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.910
going to be the pup's exposition, minus because we want to center it at that position.

263
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.430
We need to subtract from it its width at its height.

264
00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:01.530
So we are going to say papped w time zero point five.

265
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:09.530
This is the exposition pop dot y minus pop dot h time zero point five.

266
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.140
This is the Y position.

267
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:19.980
Poveda W is going to be there with pop dot H is going to be the night after that, I'm going to grab

268
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.780
the font.

269
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.880
So this is going to be the thing that we write inside of it.

270
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:30.420
So I'm going to say that it should be bold and let's grab our dollar sign and we're going to say so

271
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.230
we are going to say pop dot h is going to be the height.

272
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.030
I'm not going to.

273
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.280
Well, originally I did it zero point seven five, but I'm not going to multiply it by that because

274
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.480
I decreased it.

275
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.150
And this is something that I noticed in our final game.

276
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:54.000
So if I come to here and if I if I come here and if I try to.

277
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.200
Play this and if we get a power up by chance.

278
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.370
It is going to be very small.

279
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:08.840
I don't want it to be small yet, it's like so small that that the user cannot even hope so.

280
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.310
I am going to increase the chance.

281
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:18.910
OK, so the chance I'm going to put it to zero point, I'm going to put it to one, you know what one.

282
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.160
So if I click now, I can see that is the power up you.

283
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.870
And I'm not sure if the user is even bigger is ever going to be able to see that.

284
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.840
So I just want to increase the size of that.

285
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.060
That's what I'm actually doing here.

286
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.240
Right.

287
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.750
And.

288
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.960
OK, so this is going to be decided, we are going to toggle this, we are going to check if that that

289
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.170
is big or that is small and what is the suitable amount.

290
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.440
And then we are going to pass in our font as well.

291
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.380
So text font, perfect.

292
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.720
After that, let's align it.

293
00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:04.810
So dot text a line and I'm going to say center, so let's do center.

294
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.970
And after that let's grab our context and fill the text.

295
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.280
So text fill filled text.

296
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.090
So in here, first off, we need to pass in the text string.

297
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:24.820
So pop type dot symbol is going to be that and we need to pass in the exposition which is going to be

298
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:30.420
pop dot x and we need to pass in the Y position, which is going to be pumped at Y.

299
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.730
So we are done with Drawing the Pops.

300
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:41.200
Next up, let's go ahead and let's update the pups, so I'm going to come.

301
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.410
Where should we go ahead and update our pups?

302
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.720
So right in here we are going to create a function of date pups.

303
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:59.110
And we are going to create this function right down here, so we have our updated score.

304
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.060
So on top of the update score, I'm going to create that function.

305
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.170
So let's copy it.

306
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.380
Let's put it right here.

307
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:16.420
All right, so I'm going to call this a date, perhaps perfect.

308
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:24.260
OK, so let's create the function of date pops up date.

309
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.130
Perhaps.

310
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.570
This is missing and I.

311
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:38.280
So what we are going to what we are going to do inside the update pops inside the update Pops, we are

312
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.020
basically doing two things.

313
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.790
One, we are providing a specific speed for our pops.

314
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:50.670
And two, we want to delete the pops when they go off screen.

315
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:59.160
So we are going to say four letters are equal to now because the pups are coming down.

316
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.960
We are going to iterate over the Pops array from the from the other side or from the from the back in

317
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.650
reverse.

318
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.570
In simple terms, you are going to look through it in reverse.

319
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.100
So this is going to be minus one and the eye is going to be greater than or equal to zero.

320
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:25.620
And each time the iterates you are going to reduce documented by one.

321
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:31.800
So now let's grab our Pops array and passan the eye y position.

322
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.920
We are going to add on to the Y position.

323
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:45.720
The pups that I variable of the loop times y v and this is going to be pixels per second, so let's

324
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.280
change it to pixel per frame and this is going to be a little slow.

325
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.080
So I'm just going to multiply it by 20.

326
00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:03.810
So and finally, we want to delete pops when they go off screen.

327
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.290
Delete.

328
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:19.840
If the pops, any of the pops, so we need to iterate over that again, so if any of the Pops y position

329
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:20.740
is.

330
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:31.570
Is is less than the pup's height, and if the white position of them is less than the height of them

331
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:38.450
plus sorry, height, why should a woman passing times point five or hour?

332
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.040
If I'm just going to reiterate this, I'm a little tired.

333
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.960
That's why I did I'm not explaining this very well.

334
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:51.820
If the pups why location is less than the pups high times point five sorry.

335
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:57.230
Minus that if that is in that entire thing is less than the height of the canvas.

336
00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.560
So the Y position minus half of the height is less than the height of the canvas.

337
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.290
We are going to grab the pups away and we are going to call the splice method.

338
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:13.580
The splice is going to grab is an index which is going to be I and the number of the delete count,

339
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.750
which is going to be one.

340
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:24.660
So we have created this as well, and next up, let's go ahead and let's actually go ahead and collect

341
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.760
the pups as well.

342
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.310
So let's see if we can see any pups.

343
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.890
So there we go.

344
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.850
So that is the pup.

345
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.800
You can see that it is bigger now.

346
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.650
You can see that we cannot collect it.

347
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.960
It is going directly through this, through the paddle.

348
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:43.620
Right.

349
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.170
So we need to be able to collect the pups as well.

350
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.370
And after we collect it, we are going to play that amazing audio as well.

351
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:58.460
So I'm thinking that I should do that in our next lecture because it's been almost twenty seven minutes.

352
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.000
I'm a little tired, so I'm going to take a break, not to mess anything up.

353
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.900
And next lecture is actually going to be our final lecture.

354
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.130
So I want to like finish big.

355
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.360
So that's it for this lecture.

356
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.950
See you guys in the next one.
