00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,730
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to talk about the object entry's method.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:15,470
All right, so the object entries method is going to return the key value pairs from an object.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:15,840
All right.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,780
So let's go ahead and let's create our variable, which we are going to call in this case, entries.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,260
Let's grab our object, which provides us with this functionality.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,040
And we're going to call in the entries method and let's pass.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,950
And the favorite colors object.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,380
And finally, let's get to the console entries.

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,350
Let's save it.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,200
And we get through.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,690
We get three items and each of them is an array.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,470
So we get color one.

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:51,580
So so you can see that how this array how this method is useful because it is going to convert all the

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:59,380
keys, all the key value pairs of this array into string of this object into arrays.

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,740
Right.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,670
And it is going to return them as array items.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:12,100
So they're no longer key value pairs, they're just array items that we can access through the for each

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,350
loop.

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,880
So I'm just going to say entries that are for each where is it.

20
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,690
So entries for each today misspell anything because it should show it.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,900
So entries dot for each.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,460
It doesn't.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,060
So I guess it should work.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,440
And we're going to say entry and what do we want to do?

25
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,590
We just want to consider log that entry.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,250
So save it.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,380
And we get this first array and this is the first key value pair.

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,450
And then we get the second array, which is the second key value pair, and then we get the third array,

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,120
which is the third value pair.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,230
OK, and we can get, for example, the index of them as well.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,800
For example, just index the zero indices.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,680
We can get the first index index.

33
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,610
All right.

34
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:10,259
And and I think this is going to be it for this year.

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,800
So let's give it one more time.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,310
And that's it for this lecture.

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,140
See you guys in the next one.
