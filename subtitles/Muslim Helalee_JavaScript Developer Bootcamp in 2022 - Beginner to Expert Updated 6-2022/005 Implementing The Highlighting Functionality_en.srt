1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,910
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,630
In this letter, we are going to implement the highlighting functionality.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:15,940
All right, so so far we have created the frame, the bottom of the frame, this is the circle, which

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,520
is the thing that is in the middle of the cell.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,250
That is this entire thing, the circle that is being highlighted.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,450
But the highlight functionality is still missing.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,310
So what I'm what I am going to do is let's come down towards our new game.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,049
There it is.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,780
So on top of the new game, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create the highlight.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,460
Highlight what was the name was the highlight, great function, so let me just say highlight great

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,630
function.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,750
So let's create that as well here.

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,810
OK, so we are going to say function, highlight grid.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,590
And we are going to pass in the event object here as well.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,450
So what are we going to do at first is I just want this to return.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,300
I just wanted to return something and I'm just going to go ahead.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,500
And you know what?

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,230
We are going to first test it.

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,050
So we are going to test if it is not player's turn.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,260
Players turn and if it is not, game over.

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,370
If it is not players term and if it is game over, then we just want to return.

22
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,510
We do not want to highlight anything.

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,840
So whenever the game is over now, I did not play this completely.

24
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,710
So if the game was supposed to be like, oops, the computer won there, so if the game is over, then

25
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,510
the highlighting is not going to work.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,690
And if it is not any player's turn, then it is the highlighting is not going to work.

27
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,990
And we we would just returned from the game.

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,820
But I'm going to come in this one out.

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,510
We are going to commented and later.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:07,310
Let's create the highlight cell function for the highlights, so we are going to pass in the IDOT Client

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:15,050
X for the exposition and the IDOT client Y for the Y position.

32
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,530
Let's save that and let's go ahead and let's create the highlight cell function.

33
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,870
So I'm going to come on top of that highlight.

34
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,370
Great.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,240
So there we go.

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,950
And I'm going to create the highlight cell function.

37
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:42,000
So let's say function highlight cell now because it's got two arguments we need to pass in two parameters.

38
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,700
So we're going to pass in the X coordinate and the Y coordinate.

39
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,880
And now first off, we have to identify which column is empty.

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,020
Now, keep in mind, whenever we hover on it, whichever column is empty, that column is going to specify

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,110
whether it is null or not.

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,380
It means that do we have even an empty column?

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,010
If we don't have, then we should not put in any highlighting.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,010
So first off, and we need to grab the column now and I'm going to set it to null and I'm going to I'm

45
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,740
going to right here identify the chosen column.

46
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,480
And now let's loop over the rows.

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,800
Right.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,290
So we are going to say for that row of gret, what do we have within rows?

49
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,900
Within rows we have cells.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,570
So let's sell off row.

51
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:43,410
First off, let's clear all the existing highlighting, clear the existing Hai Lai.

52
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,850
Think so you're going to grab the cell and we are going to grab the highlight now, this highlight is

53
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,270
going to come from our class constructor class and we are going to set it to know and then let's get

54
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:09,480
the collar, get the column, and we're going to say if the cells position contains the X and Y, we

55
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,760
are going to create the contents function as well.

56
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:18,990
If it is if it contains the X and Y coordinates, we are going to say the column is cell column.

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,610
Perfect.

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,300
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to our constructor and I'm going to create that contains

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,870
function.

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,610
Right, so.

61
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,400
Perfect, so where is our constructor or constructor is right here and now let's go ahead and let's

62
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:48,030
create that contains function, so contains function and I'm going to say contains.

63
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,110
And is it the same, the spelling?

64
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,270
It's this and it's click on it.

65
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,480
I mean, do we get that?

66
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,760
Yeah, the that is the same.

67
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,560
So let's go up.

68
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,500
So we need to pass on the X and Y coordinates, right, so X and Y.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Perfect, what is going to be the X and Y, so we want this function to return if X is greater than

70
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:26,060
the disk, the left position, if X is greater than the left position, and when the X is also less

71
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,530
than the right position and you might say, OK, what does this actually mean?

72
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,000
Greater than the left, less than the right.

73
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,630
So in this case, if the X is right here, it should be greater than the left and this is the left.

74
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,810
So it starts to go all the way to here and it should be less than the right.

75
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,280
So greater than the left is this way.

76
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,560
Less than right is this way.

77
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,150
It means we should always stay within the range.

78
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,150
And also, we need to do the same thing for the wider direction, so the Y it should be greater this

79
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:04,150
the TARP, we should come towards the bottom, but we should keep in mind that it should always be less

80
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,940
than the this dot bottom.

81
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,440
So we just want our this function to return this.

82
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:23,050
Let's save it so it returns X is greater than this, the left and X is less than this dot, right?

83
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,110
Why is greater than this top and why is also greater than this bottom?

84
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,490
All right, so we have specified the range for columns.

85
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,340
I'm going to come to reserve function due to the highlighted cell function, and I'm going to go out

86
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,660
of that this loop.

87
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,830
So where does it end?

88
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,740
It ends there.

89
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,660
And I'm going to put in a comment and I'm going to say that even with all of this, if no column is

90
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,290
chosen.

91
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:04,330
OK, if a no column is still chosen, we want to we want to return from the from the function.

92
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,680
So we are going to say a column is equal to is equal to no.

93
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
It means there is no column.

94
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,130
We want to return from the function.

95
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:20,220
All right, so how this actually highlighting is going to work now, we know that we want to highlight

96
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,240
something, how how would this actually work?

97
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,650
We want the highlighting to start from the bottom.

98
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,470
So so if I if I hover on this column, you can see that the highlighting starts from the bottom.

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,100
It doesn't matter where I highlight even on this one, on itself or on the top or on the part of the

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,000
self from it.

101
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,100
The highlighting should always work, should always start from the bottom.

102
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,460
It means that.

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm just going to write the comment, highlight the first on Que PIDE cell, it means that we are going

104
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,910
to reverse and we are going to use a reverse for a loop.

105
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,420
So for the reverse for loop, we are going to set the eye should start from the first from the last

106
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,870
row.

107
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:19,490
So we are going to pass in minus one and the I should go to top all the way until it is greater than

108
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,950
or equal to zero and we are going to decrement the R each time by one.

109
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:38,510
Now we are also going to say if the great role I and the great column you remember this dot owner equals

110
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,630
now, then we want to highlight Rutt.

111
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:48,590
So if the owner is not, it means there is no owner we want to grab that creates the column and that's

112
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,400
specific.

113
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,270
The specific road, the specific column, which is J.

114
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:00,620
And we want to call that highlight and we are going to say that whichever player's turn it might be

115
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,190
and then let's return that gret.

116
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,070
Because we are going to highlight the column, not any specific row I'm going to pass in the column

117
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,660
right here, and this column is this column that we have specified as not previously.

118
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,050
And finally, let's return from this function.

119
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:27,180
So if still nothing is highlighted, it means that the function doesn't need to run, the function doesn't

120
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,250
return anything, and it returns to normal.

121
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,810
So let's save it.

122
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,620
Let's come here.

123
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,670
And Jay is not defined at the highlights of this.

124
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,590
Jay should be our column.

125
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,520
So let's pass and the column.

126
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,980
Let's hover on it.

127
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,540
We don't see any highlighting.

128
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,400
I mean, have we?

129
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,290
We have the highlights.

130
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Well, we have called the highlights cell right here.

131
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,850
And let me just do this.

132
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,630
If it is not oh, this is this only works if it is player's turn.

133
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,490
OK, so let's see.

134
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,880
So we have set for Aulet.

135
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,270
We want the it start to at the bottom row.

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,550
And we wanted to go all the way to greater and equal to zero, and then we want to dichromate we diclemente

137
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:24,870
and we say if the great column owner equals no, we want to grab the Gretz column, the highlight,

138
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,710
and we are going to specify it as the players turn.

139
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,620
And then we want to return that.

140
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:36,990
And finally, we are going to return the return null if nothing is highlighted.

141
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,770
Let's see if I if I have spelled this highlight correctly.

142
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,680
So we have highlight's cell for letter of great, cell of RO.

143
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:57,710
And if cell that contains X and Y, you are going to say cells that call and all right, so if column

144
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,650
is no return that.

145
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,770
OK, so let's come here.

146
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,800
We don't see anything and there is no air, so something is missing.

147
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,740
That's why we don't see any errors there.

148
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:20,510
OK, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to our new game function and I'm going to create a

149
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:27,450
coin toss situation just to make sure that it is a player's turn or it is not a player's turn randomly.

150
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:35,980
So I'm going to say coin toss and I'm going to say player's turn is math dot a random.

151
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:47,180
Tones less than zero point five, so if it is the player's turn, if it if it if it returns zero and

152
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,250
we can say safely say that zero point five is greater than zero, it returns true.

153
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,640
If it returns one, we can safely say that one is not less than zero point five and it is going to return

154
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,070
false.

155
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,360
So we are also going to grab the game over.

156
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,840
We are going to set it to false because the game is not over and we are going to grab the game tied.

157
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,430
We are going to set it to false.

158
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,900
Let's save that.

159
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,310
So with this in place, we should be able to see some highlighting.

160
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,570
So you can see now it is the r e player.

161
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,600
If I refresh the page, it is still that because it is randomly now you can see that it has changed.

162
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,520
The reason that it changes is because I'm just reloading with the five key.

163
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,220
I'm not coming actually here and reloading it.

164
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:42,920
So it's orange claque, it's green, kaleck, orange kaleck, green claque, green again and again.

165
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,230
Green, orange you can see.

166
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,480
So it is going to give us some highlighting there.

167
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,440
The next thing that I want to do is I want to create the actually the click function.

168
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,280
Right.

169
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,710
So the click function, we are going to create it right after the game.

170
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,180
Variables that we had.

171
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:02,810
Right.

172
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:11,990
So let's go on top, where is our game variables, so the game variables, these event listeners are

173
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,200
just going to create the click function right there.

174
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,780
OK, so we are going to grab our canvas.

175
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:28,160
Element, and we are going to say that out of a listener, that at a wellness center and we are going

176
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,200
to listen for a click and when we hear the click, we are going to create the click function.

177
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,730
All right, so let's go ahead and let's actually create the click function words or create grid.

178
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,850
There it is.

179
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,670
So in here I'm going to say click function.

180
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,530
So this click function is going to handle that selecting or selection of the cell.

181
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,620
So whenever you come like this, if you click, you can see the cell has been selected.

182
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,490
So the click function is actually going to handle that.

183
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,530
First off, let's go ahead and create that function click.

184
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,650
And first off, we need to check if the game is over or not.

185
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,300
So if game over, if the game is over, we don't want to be able to click anywhere.

186
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,690
Right.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,860
So we just want to call a new game and then we will return from this function.

188
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:31,020
If if it is if the game is not over, then we need to check if it is player's turn or if it is not the

189
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,120
plaster, if it is the player's turn.

190
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,470
Player's turn.

191
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:47,790
It doesn't matter which player, the other player, the other player should not be able to click.

192
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,630
Or to select a specific cell.

193
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,450
So we are going to see if it is not player's turn return, right?

194
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,500
So we just return.

195
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,430
But I'm going to come in this one out for now.

196
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,550
OK, I'm just going to go ahead and commented out.

197
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,150
And then we are going to call our select.

198
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,180
Select cell function as well, right?

199
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,720
So what I'm going to do next is going to be let's go ahead and let's create that select cell function.

200
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,700
All right, so I'm going to come down here on top of the dimensions way down, and we need to create

201
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,590
our select cell function.

202
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,290
All right, so let's say select cell function.

203
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,250
OK, so we are going to write function, if I can spell it correctly, come on.

204
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,680
One f perfect.

205
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:58,890
Select, not interval, select sell, and there is not going to be any parameters for that.

206
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,980
OK, so what do we want to do?

207
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,460
Whenever we want to select a sell, we want the highlighting to go away.

208
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,850
Right.

209
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,000
So let's go ahead and let's grab our highlighting.

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,020
Highlighting.

211
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,610
And you are going to set it to false.

212
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,660
All right, so.

213
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,700
Let's create a loop, so we are going to loop over all of these cells in our rows, so we are going

214
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:36,190
to say for that row of grid and then we are going to say for that row of.

215
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:37,750
Where is.

216
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:47,890
Is row for that cell of row, so we are iterating over all of them, if the highlighting is not if the

217
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:54,940
cell doesn't have any any preexisting highlight, it means the highlight of that cell is equal to.

218
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,260
Then we want to be able to highlight that.

219
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,869
So we are going to grab the highlighting and we are going to say true, and then we are going to grab

220
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,369
the highlighting of the cell.

221
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,460
We need to set it to once more.

222
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:17,869
So highlight should be cool to know right after we said the highlighting to true, we are going to remove

223
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,910
the highlight highlight from the cell and then we need to specify the owners of cell.

224
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,800
That owner is going to whichever whichever player is, whichever player is playing.

225
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,770
So we remove that player's turn.

226
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,680
And finally, we need to check for a win, so I'm going to create a function here.

227
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,520
I'm going to call it a function check when we are going to create that and we are going to grab the

228
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,900
rows and the columns, which we have specified before.

229
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,740
And whenever we need to check right after that, we are going to grab our game over and we are going

230
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,700
to set it to true.

231
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,570
Now, this is going to be one iteration of this loop.

232
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,490
And with this one iteration, the loop is going to be done.

233
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,030
And we need to break out of this iteration so we can go to the next iteration.

234
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,260
There is a key word called Alattar that we can use to break out of this loop.

235
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,250
And we need to reference that to to whichever loop it is that we are breaking out of it.

236
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,530
So we are breaking out of that loop.

237
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,620
So we are going to say that with this iteration, we just want to break out of it.

238
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:40,650
All right, and let's let's go ahead, where does this loop and it ends right there and whenever.

239
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,740
Whenever we are selecting something, we should not allow the highlighting to work as well.

240
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,810
So when we selected a specific cell, we do not want the highlighting to work.

241
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,440
So I'm just going to say do not allow.

242
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,980
Selection, I told you that the logic is pretty advanced for this game, this game might seem easy,

243
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,040
but the logic behind it there is like a lot of a lot of things that we need to consider for this to

244
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,400
game.

245
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,230
It seems like a very simple game.

246
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,400
You just connect four dots.

247
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,400
But but there is a lot of things that you're not allowed to do whenever it is the computers turn or

248
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,420
whenever it is someone else's turn, if there is a right, if there is no highlighting.

249
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,550
Right.

250
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,340
So if there is no highlighting, we do not want to tell, if there is no highlighting, we do not want

251
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,560
to allow any selection.

252
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,100
So if there is, the highlighting is not true.

253
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,470
We want to return from this function as well.

254
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:50,390
And finally, what we want to do here is let's go ahead and let's switch the player, OK?

255
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,680
So we are going to say switch the player

256
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,430
if there is no game over.

257
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:10,970
If the players are playing and if it if one player has selected a cell, we want to switch to the next

258
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,220
player until the game is over.

259
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,420
So if it is, the game over is not true.

260
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,270
It means the game is not over.

261
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,080
We want to switch to the player.

262
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,130
And it is very simple.

263
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,330
We just say player.

264
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:32,580
Players turn should not be players turn it mean whichever player is playing, we just want to switch

265
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,030
that right after the highlight, this selecting happens.

266
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,210
So the next thing that we need to do is actually go ahead and create the win the Czech win function.

267
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,380
Right.

268
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,270
And I'm going to go on top and I'm going to create that function as well in this video.

269
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:57,820
OK, so I'm going to create it right here and I'm going to say check when function for now, I'm not

270
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,360
going to do anything special with this function.

271
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:06,520
So let's grab the check when and I'm going to pass in the row because the row is going to be the cell,

272
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,830
that road that we called it as an argument.

273
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,550
And we're going to grab the parameter of columns.

274
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,300
Well, for now, I just wanted to return false.

275
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,290
We don't want to check for if there is any any of the players, they have one or not.

276
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,980
So you can see that if I go ahead and if I click, I can click for instead of the computer as well,

277
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,360
because we have not created the A.I. for this yet.

278
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,160
We are going to create it eventually.

279
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,260
So it is going to switch.

280
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:40,380
So when it is the players turn, then it is not the player's turn, player's turn, not the player.

281
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,160
So it is going to switch.

282
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,510
So each time that I click it is going to give me a different circle.

283
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,620
OK, there we go.

284
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,990
So we can select this, we are not checking for any or any of these cells to win or not.

285
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,920
So now we can see that no selection is allowed anyway.

286
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,910
And right after this is completed and there is no definite winner, we would show the game is tied or

287
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,320
draw or something or something like that.

288
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,950
So with that, this lecture comes to an end.

289
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,540
See you guys in the next one.
