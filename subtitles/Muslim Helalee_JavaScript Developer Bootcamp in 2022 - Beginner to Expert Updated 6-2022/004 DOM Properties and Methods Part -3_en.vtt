00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.340
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to talk about even more dumb properties and methods.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.680
All right.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.720
So in the previous lecture, we we left off right here and we we saw how we can apply styles through

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.540
JavaScript.

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.920
All right.

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.330
But this is not the optimum way of doing.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.990
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to comment about everything and

8
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.299
I'm going to bring this down, bring it down a bit just so we can see this picture.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.620
And I'm going to come in to see assess now in this style element, what I've done is I've added a clock

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.680
class that says for fun and we have background, color, padding, line height, font size and color.

11
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.770
Now, all of these properties can be applied on a text.

12
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.430
All right.

13
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.230
Technically, they can be applied.

14
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.900
And this is a class.

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.430
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you another another property I've done, which allows us

16
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.810
to add classes to the HTML elements, even though if they don't have that clause.

17
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.440
So right here, you can see that this paragraph doesn't have a class.

18
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.040
It only has an I.D. So the way we can do this is we we we first select that element.

19
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.560
So this here, the element is selected.

20
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.560
So then what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the para and I'm going to say class list because we

21
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.080
want to add a class to it.

22
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.790
We are going to say class list and then I'm going to sit at.

23
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.890
So from here, I just have to insert the name of the class.

24
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.970
Now keep in mind, this is not a Cyesis selecter.

25
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.470
Basically, we just add the name of the class and the name of the class for fun.

26
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.890
And when I say that everything has been applied dynamically and inside the paragraph, we can see that

27
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.130
we have a class which is for fun.

28
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.260
And now this styling is better because if for any reason we have some sort of some some kind of utilities

29
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.670
or utility components, then if we have those, those styles will still be applied on this paragraph

30
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.620
because this is just a class.

31
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.360
And these styles, they are not in line starts.

32
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.290
They are just regular styles which are apply.

33
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.510
Take a look at it.

34
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.270
This is just a regular style that we have applied.

35
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.730
And these regular styles, they don't have that high of a specificity.

36
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.210
So we don't they don't have that high of a specificity.

37
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.080
We can change and we can override.

38
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.260
But as long as they are in line, we cannot change.

39
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.130
All right.

40
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.800
And don't get me wrong, we are going to use inline styles in JavaScript as well.

41
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.320
But we should be careful when using them because they have the highest specificity.

42
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.520
And this code is absolutely ugly in JavaScript.

43
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.570
JavaScript is not is not used to style.

44
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.650
JavaScript is used to make our Web pages dynamic.

45
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.520
At least that is one of the applications.

46
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.970
So doing this inside a JavaScript file is not a best practice.

47
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.000
The way the better way is just this.

48
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.800
So with one line of code, we could replicate like like 100 lines of Cyesis properties for a single

49
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.960
element or for multiple elements.

50
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.330
All right, so this is a better approach towards styling, but basically we create a class and the classes

51
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:49.270
know we're inside our e-mail and when inside JavaScript we dynamically add it to the to the element

52
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.460
that we want to add it to.

53
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.260
All right.

54
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.350
So this was the.

55
00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.010
So this one I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to name it property number six.

56
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.740
All right.

57
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.140
So this is property number six, which is class list.

58
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.410
All right, so the next property that I want to talk about for a moment is going to be the get computed

59
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.089
styles, get computed styles.

60
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.690
Now the style.

61
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.060
Now there is something there is an idea and there is also practicality to it.

62
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.100
And in the world of stimulants, you says that any element has some pre-existing styles.

63
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.240
All right.

64
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.050
And those styles are applied by the browser.

65
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.590
Right.

66
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.700
So how can we know for sure that there are some pre-existing styles?

67
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.650
All right.

68
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.690
So let's go into our Cyesis and we see we have only stones for image.

69
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.500
This is commented out and only for for fun class.

70
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:07.530
So this one doesn't have any styles defined by us, by developers, so all the styles of this Sichuan,

71
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.580
they are all of them, their browser starts the way that you can find out where the browser stands are.

72
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.580
As you come to the elements tab, you grab the etch one and you come to the computer.

73
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.110
And in here you can see some of them.

74
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.980
All right.

75
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.870
But if you click here on the show, all you're going to see all the styles.

76
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.190
If they have a value, they are, for example, Buderim slice 100 percent.

77
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.850
This is a browser start.

78
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.360
All of these styles.

79
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.360
They are browsers, styles like this one.

80
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:47.880
There are some values like this is normal, visible, visible auto auto like the browser stars in the

81
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.980
world of stimulants.

82
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:59.580
VSS are also called default values in cyesis, for example, when you're working with Flex Volks Flex

83
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.900
Direction Row as a default value, when you change it to to column, then that default value is changed.

84
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.090
So this is where you can find all the browser styles which are applied.

85
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.570
OK.

86
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.620
So what I'm going to do is we are going to go into our.

87
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.570
XHTML as our into our.

88
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.520
JavaScript file, and I'm going to create another consonant and I'm going to call it image.

89
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:40.280
Props or image properties, and I'm going to say get computed style of this image image.

90
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.860
All right.

91
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.110
And we have declared our image before.

92
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.100
I'm just going to go ahead and comment this one out.

93
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.480
Common these ones out.

94
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.900
All right.

95
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.810
So we don't have anything in the dump.

96
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:56.770
So I want to grab the computed styles of this image element and I want to store it inside this image

97
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.220
props.

98
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.320
And I want to cancel that log.

99
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:07.730
The image props and let's save it, and now this is the true power of dome.

100
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.890
This is the true power of the document object model of JavaScript.

101
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.240
And this is why I cannot stress this enough, because this is so exciting.

102
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:27.670
I mean, this is why H.M.S. assists in JavaScript are called the Three Musketeers, the Trinity or or

103
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.290
whatever, like like the three important parts of any website.

104
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:40.300
The three building blocks of the web are H.M.S. Serious and JavaScript, and they are interconnected

105
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.140
as long as you know where to look.

106
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:51.730
So we just found out in a world of possibilities at the doorstep of JavaScript.

107
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.480
So this is this says Cyesis style declaration.

108
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.640
And when you click on it, you're going to see all these Cyesis styles.

109
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.230
Which are applied or which are not applied on that specific element.

110
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.380
All right.

111
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.420
And the cool part of this all is what is the cool part?

112
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.260
Is this part.

113
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.550
You can see that we don't have any camel casing.

114
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.830
These are regular Cyesis styles.

115
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.800
So we can use these styles as well.

116
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:23.610
Right.

117
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.960
So these are regular Cyesis styles, right.

118
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:37.419
Now, the job of this method, this jet element necessary to get computed style, is not to apply styles,

119
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.530
but to retrieve styles.

120
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.370
So what does this actually do?

121
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:48.370
It shows us the browser styles and also the applied styles.

122
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:48.990
All right.

123
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.610
So how can you how can you say that for sure?

124
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.530
You might ask.

125
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.020
So let's go ahead and let's grab our image.

126
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.770
Right.

127
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:02.110
And we are going to grab our image element, not image prompts the image element itself.

128
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.130
All right.

129
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:10.660
And we are going to tap into the world of Cyesis and we are going to give it a let's say with equal

130
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.320
to.

131
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:19.190
Huh, I don't know, like, let's put it to 800 pixels, let's save it.

132
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:26.200
And now you guys can see that this image has been stretched, of course, and I'm going to give it a

133
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.340
height as well, so the dogs do not look like cropped or anything like that.

134
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.310
So now, OK, this one is cropped.

135
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.370
Let's decrease the height to 600.

136
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.250
Hopefully this changes everything.

137
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.400
All right.

138
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.410
So now this is our image and these are the styles.

139
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.080
How can we see the top?

140
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.580
How can we find out what styles have been applied through this computer stuff?

141
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.310
So what we can do is it is super, super simple.

142
00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:04.360
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to consider log on our previous what was that method,

143
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.710
our previous method.

144
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.500
And let's look for them here.

145
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.540
So it's B, C, D, where is W?

146
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.120
So should we see W or not?

147
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.640
I think these are all browsers style, so I do not think that we can find them here.

148
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:32.620
And let's come down here and in here, I think we can find him from here, so f g h this is the height.

149
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.220
So the height says 600 pixels, which has been defined right here.

150
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.050
So where is the width, where is the width.

151
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.840
So w I'd touch.

152
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.720
Come on buddy, this is the width and the width is 800 pixels which has been defined right here.

153
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:56.170
So looking for them in this list is a bit tedious and it requires a lot of work.

154
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.570
What if you want to instantly grab that value.

155
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.080
So in that case and we want to bring it to the council as well.

156
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.460
So we are going to say consult the log.

157
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.460
We are going to grab our image props and we are going to go and we are going to go ahead and we are

158
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.300
going to say that height, because the tight height is actually a prop..

159
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:26.740
So when we do when we do the dot notation, the dot notation allows us to grab either the property or

160
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.460
the method, the differences in the parentheses.

161
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.470
If you provide parentheses, it's a method.

162
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.380
If you do not, it's a property.

163
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.730
Right.

164
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.660
So this is a property.

165
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.430
And now here is over 600 pixels.

166
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.990
So this is actually the cool part about this get computed style property.

167
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.800
All right, so this is this is actually a method I should have classified it as a method.

168
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.390
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say method.

169
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.390
And I think we have studied two methods before.

170
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.190
So this is going to be method number three.

171
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.080
All right.

172
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.550
So that's it for this lecture.

173
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.230
See you guys in the next one.
