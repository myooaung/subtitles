1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,360
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,360
In this next year, we are going to make our next and previous buttons dynamic.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:17,100
All right, so in the previous letter, we were able to successfully set our images or arrange them

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,600
next to each other, so in this lecture, we are going to accomplish two two tasks.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,390
The first task is whenever we click on the right button, moving images to the left and whenever we

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,270
click on the left button mode, move images to the right.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,550
So now let's go ahead and let's apply this logic.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,030
So what is the right button?

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,020
The right button is the next button.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,710
So let's go ahead and let's grab it.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,820
And what does clicking mean?

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,770
Clicking means we are listening for an event listener.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,290
So what is different?

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,520
Yes, it is.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
Click and then we are going to run a function.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,340
All right, and so what is it that we want to grab here?

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,030
The first thing that I want to grab here is going to be our current image that we have added.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,500
So where is the current image class?

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,020
It is right here.

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,660
So I want to grab this current image class of this a lot in here.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,090
All right.

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,400
So I'm going to say Consed Current I.

23
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,130
And we are going to say a list dot query selector.

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,240
Now another method of doing query selector is just on a specific element.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,150
So we could just say document that query selector.

26
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,300
And in that case, we would be saying that go ahead, grab the document and search for the current image

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,710
class.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,690
But in this case, because we know where the current image class is, it's inside the list.

29
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:50,960
We can just say, let's start query selector and it would only go ahead and search inside that element,

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,520
which has a class of list, and it is going to grab that current image.

31
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,050
So this is like a faster way of it, faster way of doing it.

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,970
It's not going to make that much of a difference.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,130
But you can what?

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,590
You can do it this way as well.

35
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:11,510
The next thing that I want to do is I want to grab the next image, because whenever we click on this

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,700
button, we want to go to the next image.

37
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,340
Right.

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,670
So I'm going to say I'm just going to call this variable, next image and the next image.

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,160
OK, so before doing this, I'm just going to comment it out and I'm going to consider log something

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,570
for you.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,560
And it is the current image and we are going to see what that is.

42
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:29,900
All right.

43
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,000
So when I whenever I come to the inspect, we are going to see that.

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,960
Consider the log current image, we should be able to see it.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,350
Come on, buddy, let's reload it.

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,620
It's 15 thirty that's so common that out.

47
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,910
Whenever we click on it, we see it.

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,320
All right, so this is an event when we click on it, we see our current image and this is the current

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,140
image that we have.

50
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,860
So if I come here now, the image that is displaying on the Web page is exactly our current image,

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,690
as you guys can see here in the preview.

52
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,440
All right.

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,270
So this is our current image and we have successfully selected that.

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,280
So but there is something else in here.

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:23,210
Whenever we select the current image, we want to grab the next element sibling of this current image.

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,180
All right.

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,240
So what is the next element sibling of this current image if we come to our e-mail?

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,110
So this is our current image.

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,710
What is the next element?

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,340
Sibling.

61
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,200
So this is the sibling and this is the next element sibling.

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,480
So image gallery dash two should be the next element sibling because why do we need that?

63
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:49,990
Because whenever we click on this button, we want to go to the next image and the next image is the

64
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,250
actually the next element sibling.

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,230
So I'm going to grab the current image and I'm going to say next element sibling.

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:07,780
And now if we go ahead and cancel the log, the log, the next image, next image, let's say let's

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,200
come here.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,910
So now if I go ahead and if I click on it, we should be able to see the next image.

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,510
And in here, an interesting thing has happened.

70
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,140
We can see that an inline style has been applied by JavaScript.

71
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:27,280
Now, this style left fifteen thirty six comes from this function, all right, because we have successfully

72
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,200
grabbed the with with 15 36 as we have placed it here and it has been called from there because we're

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,230
accessing the images to the next image.

74
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,190
Right.

75
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,680
And this is our second image.

76
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,220
So whenever we click on this area, we get the second image.

77
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,670
Now the logic of the dome works in this way, that first stuff you need to create variables.

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,020
Now, this is general.

79
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,720
It may not work all the time, but for most of our projects at this stage, it is going to work like

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,020
this.

81
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,770
Now we grab whatever it is that we need.

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,880
For example, in this case, we need the current image class and then we store it inside a variable.

83
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,710
The reason that we store it inside a variable is that so we can select it, we can use it somewhere.

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
If it is not stored, we cannot selected.

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,260
This is how JavaScript works.

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,370
You have to store it within something to be able to to access it.

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,500
OK, so when we store inside this current image, we are going to grab the current image and we're going

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:36,510
to say next Alman sibling, the next development sibling is going to give us the next element.

89
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,490
And finally, the next thing that I want to do here is going to be I want to grab the next index as

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,750
well.

91
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,940
So I want to grab the index of the next image as well.

92
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,190
And for that, I'm just going to grab our images are right from this, from here, from the top.

93
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,770
And I'm going to apply if a method on it and it is going to be fined index.

94
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,970
And in the finding index, what we are going to do is we are going to pass in a function and that function

95
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,470
is going to look for the next index, for the next index of the next image that we want.

96
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,580
So I'm just going to pass on a function.

97
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,730
Right.

98
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,730
And in here, what do we want to do?

99
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,220
We want to put in a parameter here.

100
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,840
So the parameter is going to be a single image because we are looking for the next index of that single

101
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,260
image.

102
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,600
All right.

103
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:34,790
And we are going to say that we want to find whenever image is equal to so triple equals, the next

104
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,890
image to the next image.

105
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:44,540
So this and this method, what it is going to do is this function is going to return the index of the

106
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,640
next image because we have given that index and name, which is the image.

107
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,630
And this image is going to have a numeric value.

108
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,340
It is going to be one, two or three or whatever.

109
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,940
Right.

110
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,870
So, so far, so good, what I'm going to do is in here now.

111
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,470
Now we have completed our I'm just going to go ahead.

112
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,710
I'm going to remove these council logs because they're not professional and they look like they crowd

113
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,570
our code a lot.

114
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,960
So I'm just going to go ahead and remove it.

115
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,440
You can't use admit, you know, how to add them.

116
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,920
So I'm just going to go ahead and remove it.

117
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,540
Now, the next thing that I want to do is and actually it is one last thing.

118
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,830
We have one other thing to do in here as well.

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,600
But what I want to do in this lecture is whenever we click on this write button, we want to be able

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,910
to move the images to the left.

121
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,970
So for that one, I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a list and I'm going to say style and I'm going

122
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,370
to say transform a right.

123
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,810
And because we are transforming them, we are translating them.

124
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,480
And translate is a property value of the transform.

125
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,800
And we are going to say translate open parentheses because translate is a function we are going to provide

126
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,330
with a negative value.

127
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,310
And the reason for that is we are moving them along the negative x axis.

128
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,620
And this is translate X.

129
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,450
All right, and in here, what I want to do is I want to grab I want to just add in space first.

130
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,410
I want to concatenate a space and we are going to grab our target image.

131
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,880
But for now, I'm just going to call it the next image or let's go ahead.

132
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,150
Let's go with the target image, because it's not going to always be the next image.

133
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,300
It could always be.

134
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,659
It could be the previous image as well.

135
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,900
And we are going to say that style that left.

136
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,650
Right.

137
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,780
And we are just going to see plus and I think this is going to be it.

138
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,180
So we have our list style transform.

139
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,020
We grab the target image.

140
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:50,830
Right.

141
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,220
And we select the style and we go to the left.

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,890
But here we have our next image.

143
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,210
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and change it to the next image for now.

144
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,430
OK, and.

145
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,850
OK, so the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab the current image as well, and I want to

146
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,710
add I want to add or either remove a clause.

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,020
So first off, I'm going to remove a clause from it and the class is going to be yes, you guessed right.

148
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,750
It is going to be the current Dasch image.

149
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:33,660
And whenever the next for example, when we have our current image, we want to remove the current image

150
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,200
clause and we want to add that current image clause to what?

151
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,000
To our next image.

152
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,100
We want to add that current.

153
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,300
So I'm going to say class.

154
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,840
Let's start at and let's go ahead and let's say current dash image.

155
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,250
All right, so let's save it.

156
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,920
Let's come in to our Web page.

157
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,960
Let's close this and let's click on this.

158
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,720
All right, so let's go ahead and let's click on this image, so when I click on it, we can see that

159
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,020
we go to our next image, but actually we are not going to our next image.

160
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,050
Our next image is appearing from the right to the left.

161
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,780
We are styling the property, the left property, and this is where the property lies.

162
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:26,810
OK, so it's this transform is going to grab the value of the left from this image, right?

163
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:35,130
And the value for the left of this image has been calculated right here, which is what this Jet-Black

164
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,290
bounden client rectangle that with, which is fifteen thirty six.

165
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,390
And it doesn't matter how many times we collect it, we are always going to go to the next image, but

166
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,270
we don't have any more images now.

167
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,130
There are quite a lot of problems here.

168
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,660
First, whenever we go to our last image, we still see this arrow.

169
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,720
We don't see our left arrow and we cannot go back as well.

170
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,070
So those problems we are going to start fixing in our next lecture.

171
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,890
See you guys in the next lecture.
