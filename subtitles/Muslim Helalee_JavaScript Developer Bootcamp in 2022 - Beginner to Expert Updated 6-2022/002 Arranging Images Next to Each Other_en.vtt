00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.650
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.710
In this letter, we are going to go ahead and arrange our images next to each other.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.280
All right, so first things first, what I'm going to going to do is we have to select the elements

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.400
that we want to work with.

5
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.830
So the first element that I want to select is going to be the list, right.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.320
Because I want to grab all the children of that list and I'm going to show you another way that we can

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.920
select them.

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.220
OK, so I'm just going to call this variable list and I'm going to say document that query selector,

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.350
because there is only one list that we want to grab.

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.150
There is one list and we want to grab it.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.080
So we are just going to say, query, select and we are going to pass in the class.

12
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.490
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab all the images and I want to create an array.

13
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.920
OK, so I'm just going to say array that from.

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.020
So wherever we get our items, there are going to be the array items.

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.370
Right?

16
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.930
So I'm going to say a list that children and we have talked about the children.

17
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.380
All right.

18
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.090
Property, the children.

19
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.260
Yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.190
It is a property.

21
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.460
And then the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab our next button.

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.670
So I'm just going to call it next Vitton.

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.410
Now, the next button is the button on the right.

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.760
Right.

25
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:28.450
So I'm just going to say document that query selector and the class for that is Dot Beaton Dash.

26
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.210
Right.

27
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.280
Right.

28
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.900
So let's go ahead and check it out here.

29
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.170
So this is the class.

30
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.730
Now, if I grab it by this class, this class of BATNA is shared with the first button as well.

31
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.030
But this class of Vitton that's left is unique.

32
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.380
Right?

33
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.000
So we are just going to select and buy those classes.

34
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.980
OK, so the next thing that I want to do is and which is the final thing in here is I want to grab the

35
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.510
left button as well and I'm going to call the left button, the previous button.

36
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.180
So previous buttons.

37
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.230
Right.

38
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.520
So the first thing that we have to do here is we need to grab the width of the image.

39
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.690
Whenever we can grab the width of our images, then we can be we can put our images next to each other.

40
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.730
We can arrange them next to each other.

41
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.740
Whenever we want to arrange our images next to each other, we should know the width.

42
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.250
So whenever that with ends, we want to exactly at that point insert another image.

43
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.080
OK, so at the point where the image with ends, we want to insert another image right there.

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.980
So in here, I'm just going to write a comment and I'm going to say getting images, images with and

45
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.210
for this one, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another consonant and I'm going to call it

46
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.530
image with.

47
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.160
All right.

48
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.250
And we have talked about how this images is an array.

49
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.700
So if this images is an array, what I can do is I can success, I can access, not success.

50
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.620
I can access the items within those within.

51
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.570
Within the array.

52
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.670
By the by selecting their index.

53
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.720
So the first item that I want to select is going to have the index of zero.

54
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.200
So whenever I select that, I want I want to call a method of get bounding client direct on it.

55
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.090
Right.

56
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.130
And from there, what I want to do is because whenever we call this method on any data structure, what

57
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:40.690
what this method allows us to do is it gives us a lot of dimensions, a lot of coordinates that we can

58
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.260
work with.

59
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.250
Now, what is the coordinate or what is the dimension that I want to work with?

60
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.780
And that is the width.

61
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.790
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead, uncancel log it so we can see what is what is

62
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.130
it that we have just grabbed here.

63
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.540
So I'm just going to say images with let's save it.

64
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.650
Let's come here.

65
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.070
Let's go to inspect and let's go to sources.

66
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.740
Don't worry about this message.

67
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.720
This is because of the font.

68
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.340
Awesome that we have included here.

69
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.600
All right.

70
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.750
And now we see that we have a 15 36.

71
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.420
So the width of this image is actually 15, 36, six pixels.

72
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.149
But notice, we don't have our pixel value here.

73
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.980
It just gives us the width.

74
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.860
It doesn't give us like a unit for that width.

75
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.520
So what do we have to do is we should add a pixel unit to it as well.

76
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.750
And we are going to do that whenever we want to arrange.

77
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.410
No one can say arranging.

78
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.160
We want to arrange the images next to each other.

79
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.860
I'm just next to each other.

80
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.890
And should I write them together?

81
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.900
No, that does not look well.

82
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.760
All right, so in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to run a function, right.

83
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.730
And I'm going to say sit AMG position.

84
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.370
So this is the name of this function.

85
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.490
It is set IMG position.

86
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.200
All right.

87
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.820
And in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass in two parameters.

88
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.970
The first one is image, then the second one is index.

89
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.710
All right.

90
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.020
And we are going to grab our image and we are going to say style.

91
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.630
Now we are in the classroom and we are going to say left.

92
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.680
So whenever the user clicks on the right button, we want to move them just to the left.

93
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.670
OK, and what what should this value be equal to?

94
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:34.310
It should be equal to our images with images or image with it should be equal to the image with times,

95
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.410
the index for that image.

96
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.220
Plus what what should we add to the unit and what does this exactly mean?

97
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:49.510
It means that we are going to call our function of sitt image position, OK, and we are going to pass.

98
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.500
And what do we want this function to do?

99
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.680
We want we want these parameters to be calculated inside this function.

100
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.620
So we have our image and we are going to style that image.

101
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.950
And in this style, we are going to grab the left property.

102
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.530
Now, the left property for our images is going to come from this image with that, we just calculated

103
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.810
there.

104
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.780
So now let's let's say the first images showing.

105
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.750
So this is going to be our first image.

106
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.430
What is the index for the first image?

107
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.010
We know that indices start from zero.

108
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.390
So this index is going to be zero.

109
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.740
So image time zero, we are going to get zero.

110
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.310
Right.

111
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.650
And zero plus pixels we are going to grab we are going to end up with zero pixels.

112
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.990
And what does that mean?

113
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.930
It means that the first image will not be moved to the left because the this distance that we want to

114
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.700
move it by is just zero.

115
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.780
OK, so now let's go ahead and let's take it the second image.

116
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.260
But we don't have any kind of loop in here.

117
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.640
So this function will just go ahead and calculate the first image.

118
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.620
What what about the rest of the images?

119
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.000
So for them to be calculated, we need to pass in a a loop.

120
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:10.520
So what I'm going to use is a for each loop and in there what what do I want this for each loop to loop

121
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.290
over or to iterate over.

122
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.040
I want it to iterate over this image function.

123
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.590
Right.

124
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.210
So now in here, what what does this look does is whenever we call this function inside this for each

125
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.870
the first thing that this for each is going to do is grab the image that has an index of zero.

126
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.110
Well, actually, they grab the lie because lies are the children of the list.

127
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.070
But you keep the unit, you get the idea.

128
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.990
So the lie, which has an index of zero.

129
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.310
This thing is going to happen.

130
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.390
We just talked about it.

131
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.700
But what if what about the lie, which has an index of one.

132
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.080
So we are going to grab our image and the index is one.

133
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.460
All right.

134
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.650
And what is the image with the images with is going to be fifteen, thirty six times one, which is

135
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.400
going to be fifteen, thirty six and we are going to add pixel to it.

136
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:06.870
So the second image which has an index of one, is going to be moved to left by what, distance by distance

137
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.470
of fifteen, thirty six pixels and so on and so forth.

138
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.560
So for the second image the distance is going to be fifteen, thirty six times the index and the index

139
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.510
is going to be two.

140
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:24.990
And this in this manner, these images with there are going to be calculated and all images are going

141
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.030
to be sitting next to each other.

142
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.409
All right, so I'm just going to go ahead and close this, and now after this code, you guys can see

143
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:40.669
that now we can see our first image sitting here, because right now, all images, they're not on top

144
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.679
of each other as we had them before.

145
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.610
They are sitting next to each other.

146
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.290
Right.

147
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.350
So they're sitting next to each other and starting from the next video onwards, we are going to see

148
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.310
where those images actually sit.

149
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.770
That's it for this video.

150
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.360
See you guys in the next one.
