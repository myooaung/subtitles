00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.040
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.070
In this lecture, we are going to create the evilness year for the lists container's are.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.510
So this is the resource.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.020
I should have probably shown you this before the start of the previous lecture, but I kind of forgot

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.320
that.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.250
So I have included this link inside this the submerges file.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.070
And it is basically a reference to the documentation where it says e-mail drag and drop API.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.920
OK, now what is an API?

9
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.570
We have used this term for like maybe like four or five times by now APIs application programming interface,

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.480
which we are going to discuss in depth.

11
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.690
And we are going to have multiple projects in this, even though this is an API project as well.

12
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.260
But we are going to take a look at real APIs.

13
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.620
Right.

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.490
But not now.

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.060
That is like a topic for, like many more chapters to come.

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.640
All right.

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.040
So it says drag and drop interfaces enable applications to use drag and drop features.

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.090
And the browsers, the users may select dragonball elements with a mouse, drag those elements to dragonball

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.360
element and drop them by releasing the mouse button.

20
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.170
Now, this gives you this entire overview of what it is that we are actually doing.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.550
Where is the documentation for that?

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.990
Because it doesn't matter how you how skilled you are, it doesn't matter how professional you are.

23
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.820
You should always come to this MDN Mozilla developer network or developer that Mozilla that Orrock.

24
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.490
This is the official documentation for e-mail, Sears's and JavaScript and Technologies.

25
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.600
All these technologies.

26
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.490
You can find them here and you should always go by this, by this documentation.

27
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.590
Whatever it says is accurate.

28
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
Whatever it says is like authentic.

29
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.100
This is the most authentic resource that you can find on a stimulus basis in JavaScript.

30
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.970
All right.

31
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.740
So there is a lot of exercises.

32
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.720
There is a lot of

33
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.910
examples here, and it even gives you the browser support for whereas this specific the browser support

34
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.600
should be the browser support is actually for every specific event that we have, for example, a drug

35
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.610
leaf, if you click on it and if you come here, you're going to see the browser support or browser

36
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.210
compatibility for that specific event.

37
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.030
So this link is included inside the API.

38
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes, go ahead.

39
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.610
Like open and go through whatever it says.

40
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.060
It might seem a bit weird at first, but once when you get the hang of it, you will know how documentation

41
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.670
is written and how to translate documentation into like real world applications.

42
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.210
It is going to help you a lot.

43
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.560
All right.

44
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.740
So now let's get back to whatever we were talking about.

45
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.620
So we have created the drugs start and drug and events for our items.

46
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.850
Now, as far as the items are concerned, they do their job.

47
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.920
They are Dragonball.

48
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.260
And we can grab the list items and we can drop him in other containers, but only we cannot drop them

49
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.140
because we don't have these containers.

50
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.040
They have no idea that any element wants to be dropped there.

51
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.920
So we should make sure that they do have an idea.

52
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.090
All right.

53
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.160
So first of all, we need to do is I'm going to come here and we are going to create another for loop.

54
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:50.430
This time, I'm going to give the loop variable in name B, it is going to loop over our lists, dot

55
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.980
a length that was very sharp.

56
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.030
Right.

57
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.990
And we are going to incremented by one each time.

58
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.840
And first off, let's go ahead and let's take a look at what it is going to give us.

59
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.560
So consed last, let's just call a list equals lists and let's pass it and we're Lutherville let's say

60
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.550
consider log our list.

61
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.029
So it let's come here so we get our.

62
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:33.060
All right, so we get all of our containers, the reason that they are repeating multiple times is because

63
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.680
they're actually repeating a lot.

64
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.580
So this is each one she should repeat for like a few times for I think to be accurate, each one should

65
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.490
be repeated four, eight times.

66
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:51.030
The reason for that is, is that every time this for a loop runs.

67
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.030
This for a loop is going to run as well.

68
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.120
That is the basic ideology.

69
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.670
So this for loop for error lists, a list of items is going to run eight times.

70
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.470
And in each of those eight times, this for a loop is going to run.

71
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.780
And in each of those eight times, this for a loop is going to run four times.

72
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.480
So we should end up with forty like four, four into eight like 32.

73
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.500
Right.

74
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.440
So at this point, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a list and I'm going to add an event listener

75
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.640
to it of the event listener for first off, we are going to complete the event listeners for dragging

76
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.040
and then we are going to dive into the final event listener, which is for dropping.

77
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.780
Right.

78
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:43.500
So I'm going to grab the list out of listener and we are going to grab the drag over.

79
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.610
This is when the drag has come over to the list.

80
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.450
All right.

81
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.020
When it comes over, this is a different event.

82
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.790
And when it enters, that is a different stage to each of these is going to be a different state.

83
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.960
So to be able to differentiate between those, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this and I'm

84
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.620
going to open up.

85
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.560
Then what I'm going to, like, open this page up again.

86
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.910
So drag over, is it?

87
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.140
It says a drag.

88
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:21.750
The item is being dragged over a valid drop target every few hundred milliseconds and drag enter a drug

89
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.040
item, enters a varlet drop target.

90
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.450
All right.

91
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.930
So what I'm going to do is whenever this happens, I want to grare.

92
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.990
I want to grubin and I want to say I want to run a function.

93
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.540
Let's grab the event object as well.

94
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.000
And I'm going to see, say, idot prevent default.

95
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.100
That's it.

96
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.610
And why did I do this now?

97
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.290
By default, dropping inside an alignment is disabled.

98
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.980
In order to enable it, we need to prevent the default behavior.

99
00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.230
So if I were to lay this out, just commented out very simple, scrub this.

100
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.220
And when I come here you can see that not allowed sign that we have because it is not OK to drop something

101
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.500
there.

102
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.390
All right.

103
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.660
But if I am coming this and save it and when I come here, you can see that this is different.

104
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.310
It says that we can drop it here, but we are going to still get when we whenever we go outside, we

105
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.300
are going to get that not allowed, which is OK.

106
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.720
Right.

107
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.880
So we have prevented the default behavior there.

108
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:37.140
Another default behavior is associated with the drug enter because items that are not also allowed to

109
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.810
be entered in inside another item.

110
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.190
All right.

111
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.070
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our event listener and I'm going to say drag enter.

112
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.650
Dragon is right, and we are going to say function, let's grab our event object and we are going to

113
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.720
say idot prevent.

114
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.420
Prevent default.

115
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:07.530
This is a method, so we are looking at parentheses and now, OK, now these are done all right, this

116
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.020
drug over and drug enter.

117
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.140
But there is something else that I want to do here.

118
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.030
So, for example, I have just selected item number one.

119
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:22.260
And when I come over here and when I enter, you can see that the background color, it actually changes.

120
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.010
So how can we accomplish that?

121
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.590
We are going to accomplish that.

122
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.660
And then we are going to move on to our next lecture.

123
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.530
All right.

124
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.760
So for that, I'm just going to grab the color code from this screen.

125
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.039
It is like a shade of white.

126
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:45.420
So we are going to say less that style, that background, background color should be equal to this

127
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:45.750
color.

128
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.980
Right.

129
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.750
So let's have it.

130
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.720
Now, we can see whenever we enter that drug area.

131
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.790
So let's OK, let's come here.

132
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.170
Let's go and enter.

133
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.630
We can see that it is actually working.

134
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.650
But the problem is that it stays there.

135
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.910
It doesn't go away.

136
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.510
So we should apply another drug event, which is drug leave.

137
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:12.890
So whenever we enter, this should change background image, sorry, background, color.

138
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.680
But when we leave it should go back and it doesn't go back.

139
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.570
It stays because there is no event for that which we are going to complete in our next lecture.

140
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.820
See you guys then.
