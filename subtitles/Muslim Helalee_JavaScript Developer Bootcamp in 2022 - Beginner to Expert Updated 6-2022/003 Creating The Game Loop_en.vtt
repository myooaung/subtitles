00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.870
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.480
In this next year, we're going to create our game loop.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:16.510
All right, so in the previous project, we talked about the game loop and how the job of the game loop

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:26.450
is just to redraw the screen for us, like, for example, in the case of a 60 hertz screens 60 times

5
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.500
per one second.

6
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.690
And that is going to give us the illusion of actually animating certain pieces of the canvas.

7
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.260
Right.

8
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.780
So in this case, we are basically in any kind of game project, we are going to be involved with some

9
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.290
sort of a game loop.

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.690
All right.

11
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to create a comment now before that, we have done

12
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.810
some stuff here.

13
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.720
And I'm sure you know what these are.

14
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.170
We have selected our canvas with what's called the 2D context.

15
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.600
You specified height and a width, and I should probably save it and open up a life server.

16
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.770
And so this is going to be our game.

17
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.110
And I forgot the project number, so I'm just going to add it right here.

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.470
So project number, it's 41.

19
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.960
All right.

20
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.710
So what do we have?

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:32.000
So first off, I'm just going to say running the game or I'm just going to call it the game loop, the

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.020
game loop.

23
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.820
So I'm going to create a function and I'm going to call this function run game.

24
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.480
Right.

25
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.330
There are there are going to be any parameters.

26
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.200
But the first thing that we want to do inside this function is we want to request animation frames.

27
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.640
Now, this request animation front is going to render this function 60 times per second because that

28
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.340
is the refresh rate of our screen.

29
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.690
So 60 times per second, we are refreshing our screen.

30
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.740
And each time the screen is being refreshed, we are drawing a specific piece on the screen and in the

31
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.140
next refresh because that piece is likely going to change its position.

32
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.440
We are going to remove the previous mirage or image of that specific piece that we have.

33
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.150
So I'm going to call the function right here and I'm going to say a run game.

34
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.540
Now, what do we want this Rangin to do?

35
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.830
First things first?

36
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.290
Let's go ahead and let's test this.

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.590
So I'm going to say game running.

38
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.310
I'm going to test it, of course, in our next project.

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.350
I'm not going to be I'm not going to be doing all the stuff from the ground up.

40
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.770
I'm just providing you with a solid foundation so we can go ahead and we can dive into creating these

41
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.480
kinds of awesome games.

42
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.560
So you can see that this game running, this is actually running and this is going to run 60 times per

43
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.390
second because of our refresh rate.

44
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.450
So we can see that our game loop has been created.

45
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.430
And I'm going to delete this.

46
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.270
Now, the first thing that I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to delete this and I'm

47
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.540
going to come down here and I'm going to create some variables.

48
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.890
I'm not going to comment anything.

49
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.690
So the first variable that I'm going to create is going to be the exposition and I'm going to put it

50
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.630
at 400.

51
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.950
These are the positions for a Super Bowl.

52
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.950
Then I'm going to create the Y position y p.

53
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.540
Now, in the previous lecture, in the previous chapter, we talked about this position and we said

54
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.190
that the horizontal position and horizontal velocity will literally wrote the entire phrase.

55
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.010
But that's that's going to take a long time.

56
00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:02.380
And you saw how many mistakes or typos we had in our previous project, which ended up in creating BUKs.

57
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.160
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to abbreviate them to X, which is horizontal position X and

58
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.780
Y P vertical position.

59
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.590
And then if we have I don't think we have velocity in here.

60
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.829
But if we were to have velocity four X, I'm going to say X, V, capital V and Y capital V.

61
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.900
So this is going to be the position where the ball is going to appear.

62
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.020
Now, keep in mind, this position is actually the center point for a ball.

63
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.840
So if I reload this page, you can see that the ball is directly in the middle.

64
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.610
And that's exactly right here.

65
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.270
So the center of the ball has an X of 400 and a Y of three hundred.

66
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.140
And then whenever we give it the radius 50 and then say the start angle is zero and the end angle is

67
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:58.860
math, that PI times two, it is going to draw this entire circle around the specific dot or the specific

68
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.180
coordinate that we gave it.

69
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.590
So these are actually the coordinates of the center of the circle.

70
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.780
Now let's give it the radius.

71
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.020
Radius, and I'm going to say I'm going to give it 50 and we are going to give it a speed of.

72
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.550
So let's save it after that, what I'm going to do as before drawing the the ball here, I'm going I'm

73
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.090
going to call the draw ball function.

74
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.820
And keep in mind, this should be at the end.

75
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.500
This run game should be at the end.

76
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.090
So now let's go ahead and let's draw a ball so we know we want to draw.

77
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:46.370
I'm going to say drawing the ball now, whenever we want to draw this ball, we have we know all we

78
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.780
have all the background.

79
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.810
We know how we can draw a circle.

80
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.340
So first things first, let's call that.

81
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.660
Let's define the function, draw the ball, no parameters.

82
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.440
And I'm going to say canvas context for first of all, let's say for style, I'm going to set it to

83
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.800
white.

84
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.040
So if you're to fill that circle, you're going to say first style.

85
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.150
If you want to just provide the circumference color, you just going to say feel sorry, stroke style.

86
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.490
So canvas context that begin path.

87
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:30.260
All right, canvass context, dot org, so this is the method now we have our horizontal position,

88
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:38.500
which is expe vertical position, which is why p we have a radius, the start angle is going to be zero.

89
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.470
The end angle is going to be math dot pi, which is going to give us 180 degrees and we are going to

90
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.400
multiply it by two.

91
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:54.740
So we get 360 and finally canvas dot fill it so that we should be able to see a circle here.

92
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.580
There we go.

93
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.290
We see a circle right there.

94
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.040
Right.

95
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.750
So we have been able to draw that circle right now.

96
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:10.940
If we were to give it some motion, what we would do as we are going to, we have to specify the.

97
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.170
Now I want to move the circle using my Iraqis.

98
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:23.000
You could move it using the A W and SD keys, which are I think these are the keys, which you usually

99
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.230
play games with them.

100
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.750
Like if you want to move, like for example, like a racing game, you want to move to right and left,

101
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:36.800
you can say A and D or you want to, for example, like move forward, which you don't have to really.

102
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.540
It's going to move forward by itself.

103
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:45.500
But you get the point if you want to move like that, you can either say the A W is D or like the Arrow

104
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.770
keys.

105
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.790
But I think the arrow keys are like they are they are going to make more sense.

106
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:58.640
So what we are going to do in the next lecture is we are going to grab the arrow inputs and we are going

107
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:08.240
to say whenever we press the up arrow, whenever we press the arrow through this, whenever I press

108
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.110
K doesn't go away.

109
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.010
It's just whenever I press the up arrow, it should move up.

110
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.260
Whenever I press the down arrow, it should move down in the same way for a left and right.

111
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.120
But instead of the key press, we are going to listen for key down.

112
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.640
Whenever the key is down, we are going to move forward and whenever the key is up, we are going to

113
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.950
stop moving forward.

114
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:40.100
And the reason that we are going to use key track, key down and keep is keep press only fires once,

115
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:48.890
but key down fires continuously until the event does not fire anymore, until we take our hand off that

116
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.210
key.

117
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.180
So that's it for this lecture.

118
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.810
See you guys in the next one.
