00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,170
Hi, everyone, in this that we working to make the toolbar functional.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:18,220
All right, so we have covered so far this, but we have we cannot increase the stroke with we cannot

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,320
change the color, we cannot update this number and we cannot, of course, clear.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,810
So these are the things that hopefully we will cover in this lecture.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,380
The first thing that I want to do as I'm going to grab our increase button.

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:40,180
So I'm just going to I'm just going to comment it and we are going to say increase between now the increased

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,590
PETN is already selected and the JavaScript and we are going to add an event.

8
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,650
Listener driven listener is, of course, going to be click and when the user clicks, we are going

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,700
to run a function.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,170
Now, usually this is not for for the most part, not always.

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,550
For the most part, this is not an optimum way of doing even listeners.

12
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,709
Of course, when there is like there are two scenarios.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,110
The first scenario is we used fat arrow functions, which I do not like calling them fat, just I'm

14
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,150
just going to be calling them error functions.

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,860
That conveys the point.

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:24,170
And the second thing is, whenever we use whenever we do event listeners, we usually call the function

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,490
here.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,650
We just write their function name and we specify or we write the function down here or up there.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,390
Right.

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,230
So we usually do that whenever we have a lot of lines of code inside our event.

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,400
Listener, that is a more cleaner way of doing JavaScript.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,150
But for the purposes of these beginner to intermediate level projects that we're working now, this

23
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,510
is going to do fine.

24
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,730
So whenever we click on the increase button, what do we want to do is we want to increase the size

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,260
and each time.

26
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,130
Now, here is the fun part.

27
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:07,760
So if you want to click on this plus sign and you want to increase this by one, you just add to the

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,900
size one.

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,010
So you just say plus equal to one.

30
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,790
That said, if you want to add five to it, whenever you click this plus sine you want to add five,

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,530
you just going to say five.

32
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,800
But we want incremented one by one.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:32,210
But there is going to be a level, there is going to be a limit to the amount of instrumentation that

34
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,520
we are going to implement and the level is going to be sorry, the limit is going to be 50.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,460
So if it is above 50, we want to keep it at 50.

36
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,170
So, for example, if the user wants to go above 50, like 60, 70, we are not going to allow the user

37
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,210
to go above that.

38
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,900
So we are going to keep it at that.

39
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,990
So if size is greater than 50, this is where programmed logic comes in.

40
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,800
If size is greater than 50, we are going to keep the size at 50.

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,820
That's it.

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,860
So this is the increase button.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,200
Let's go ahead and let's see if it actually works.

44
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,360
So now I'm just going to click on it and we see this line is thicker already.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,640
So let's click a bit more.

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,660
And now this line is thicker, very visual.

47
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,950
This is a good thing.

48
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,930
And now this line is thicker.

49
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,300
Of course, there are some problems with this.

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,170
We are not updating this number, which we are going to get to it later in this video or in the next

51
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,510
video.

52
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,470
So this is going to be the increase button.

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,310
The next one is the decrease BTN.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,780
We are going to grab the decrease button and we are going to add an event listener.

55
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,260
And again, we are listening for a click.

56
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:52,150
We are going to run a function and the function is going to decrease the size by one.

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,310
So we, we want to increase the size by one.

58
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:05,090
Each time we click on the plus side and in the same manner, we want to decrease the size by one whenever

59
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,580
we click on the negative side.

60
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,910
So we are going to say size is equal to is going to be equal to one, but there is also going to be

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,480
a limit.

62
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,790
So we need to control the flow here.

63
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,000
Whenever the size is less than one, the size is less than one.

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,620
We do not want to go there.

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,630
That's why we are going to keep the size at.

66
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,030
One, all right, so the user cannot go less than one.

67
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,340
So whenever I refresh the page, the size is going to be 10.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,180
So let's try it.

69
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,400
Hi, this is ten now.

70
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,490
Oh, this should be one.

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,850
So you can see this is the difference, right.

72
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,460
So we have successfully implemented the increase button and the decrease button.

73
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,130
However, we cannot go away.

74
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,310
We cannot.

75
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:04,100
So far, we are not able to update our increment on the screen, right, and now let's go ahead and

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,490
let's create that function here as well.

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:14,990
So updating updating the stroke with.

78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:24,320
Dynamically, dynamically her, right, so we are going to create a function and we are going to say

79
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,970
update size, right?

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,520
And we are not going to pass in any parameter what we are going to do is we are going to grab our stroke

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,130
thickness, which we have selected right here.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,410
This is a stroke thickness, which is the size and the size is this number right here.

83
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,860
So this number is initially 10, but we want to update it to 11.

84
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,760
If the user clicks on the plus sign once or to nine if the user clicks on the negative sign once.

85
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,330
Right.

86
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:03,660
Meaning that whenever the user clicks on either of the increase or decrease button, we want to update

87
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,230
that number accordingly.

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,360
So the way we can do that is we are going to grab the stroke thickness and we are going to say inor

89
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,040
text.

90
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,100
In their text, there are three N's, make sure you spell it correctly and we are going to set it to

91
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,790
Sise save it.

92
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,560
Let's come here.

93
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,180
So when I click on this, it doesn't show anything.

94
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,720
And the reason for that is we have not called this function.

95
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,810
So this is a good point because this function is asleep right now.

96
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,340
We need to wake it up.

97
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,210
So in order to wake it up, we are going to come into our increase button and we are going to say update

98
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,190
size and we are just going to call it fair and also call it here.

99
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,180
So let's provide a space here.

100
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,830
Let's save it.

101
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,170
So now this function is called here and the function is called right here.

102
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,420
So it's klegg, it still does not work, so we have to update size.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,990
Stroke thickness there.

104
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:22,130
All right, so stroke thickness in her text, make sure you spell it correctly, so let's klegg.

105
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,320
This is this is working.

106
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,640
So now the size is going to be 26.

107
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,990
This is 26.

108
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,330
This is 36.

109
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,740
Bigger, of course.

110
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,870
Let's go all the way to 50.

111
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,570
So we need to check at the boundary as well.

112
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,240
So this is 50 and it doesn't matter.

113
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,040
OK, leave it.

114
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,730
It doesn't matter how many, many more times the user is going to click, it's not going to increase

115
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,360
beyond that.

116
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,810
And let's go all the way to one.

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,960
Let's see if it goes below one, which you have specified it should not go and let's see if it does

118
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:57,800
so.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,740
C, it does not go below one and this is one.

120
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,690
So these functionalities there are done.

121
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:12,230
The only thing remaining here, actually the only two things remaining here is whenever we change the

122
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,510
color here, we want the strokes style to take on this color.

123
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,540
All right.

124
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,220
And the colors to change to this.

125
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,200
And whenever we click on the clear, we want to clear all of the all of the canvas, which we are going

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,940
to implement in our next lecture.

127
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,290
See you guys then.
