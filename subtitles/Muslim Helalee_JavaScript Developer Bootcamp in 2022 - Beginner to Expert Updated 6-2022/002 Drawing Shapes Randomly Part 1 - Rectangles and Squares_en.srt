00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:07,410
Welcome to the first part of randomising drawing shapes.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,630
All right, so in this part, what we are going to do is we are going to go over how we can draw shapes

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,280
randomly.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,140
So that is a very tedious thing.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,780
If we were to, like, draw circles one by one, like manually inside JavaScript.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,810
I mean, isn't there like a way to automate this process?

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,240
There is.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,930
And we are going to use the four loops.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,150
So this is this lecture is drawing drawing shapes randomly.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,260
And in this lecture, we are just going to draw rectangles and squares and let's get started.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,970
So inside the HTML, inside the system of document, in this style, we have the things that we just

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,060
discussed in our previous lecture, except for this overflow.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,510
We just don't want any scroll bars in our screen.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,870
Right.

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,930
And then we have our basic canvas element.

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,430
And I'm going to save this.

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:09,000
And we have selected our canvas element and we have initiated our canted context.

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,950
Now, the width of the canvas now is the window to enter.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,440
The height is window, that inner height and the width is window that inner with.

20
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,740
And so the height starts from right here, goes all the way here and the width starts from here and

21
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,750
goes all the way there.

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,500
So the canvas takes up the entire viewport height and with.

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,370
All right, so the first example that I want to talk about is I want to randomize the location.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,260
So I'm just going to create a long come and write like this.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,430
And I'm going to say drawing rectangles, slash squares.

26
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,160
Right.

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,720
Squares randomly, randomly.

28
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,780
So the first example.

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:09,630
Example, what we are going to say, randomizing randomizing the location, right?

30
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,010
So now how can we do that?

31
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,800
Now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create a for a loop and we are going to sell it, I.

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:26,590
Equal to, for example, we want to we want the idea to start from one and now how many how many squares

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,180
or rectangles do we want?

34
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,930
So here is where we specify the number.

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,360
Let's say I want to I want 11.

36
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,180
Right.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,730
And each time the I's done, we are going to incremented by one.

38
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,930
Now, where is a logic right now?

39
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,500
The logic is inside here.

40
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,910
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say canvas that context.

41
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,240
First off, let's go ahead and provide a color for those.

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,070
And I'm going to say so let's just say white and now let's draw them.

43
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,430
Right.

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:04,060
So I'm going to say Phil RACT now the Phil Rectangle, it requires four things X, the horizontal position,

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,480
vertical position within height.

46
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,850
So the horizontal position is going to be dynamic because if I hardcoded, then what is the point of

47
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,510
this Falu?

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,890
We want we want to randomize the location Arcady position.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,060
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to put an X for the horizontal position and put in Y for the

50
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,960
vertical position.

51
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,850
And I'm going to say a square of 50 by 50 right now.

52
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,880
We need to specify X and Y, right.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,450
So I'm going to say X.

54
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,750
Should be equal to now we want to randomize, so for the four randomisation, we have a math, the random

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,340
method.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,010
Now, this is going to give us random numbers from zero to one, right?

57
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,940
So what we are going to do is whenever we get this, because we are dealing with the inner high inner

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,760
with an inner height of our screen, we want to randomize our rectangles within this space.

59
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,410
So what I'm going to do is because the inner with an inner high, they have some dimensions.

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,480
What I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply this with the window dot inner with because it's X and

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
X is horizontal.

62
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,360
We are just going to multiply it by inner with and we're going to say let y be equal to the same thing.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:34,080
So math, not random, is going to give us a number between zero and once a zero point one zero point

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,960
two all the way to zero point nine.

65
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,060
And we are going to multiply that number by the Anahi by the inner high.

66
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,950
So let's say the inner height is, for example, one like for me, I think it's 15 thirty six by seven

67
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,120
hundred and something.

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,800
So let's say 1500 and 700.

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:02,340
So if it is 1500, 1500 multiplied by for example, point one, it's going to be I think 150 or something,

70
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,340
something like that.

71
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,600
So this is going to randomize the location.

72
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,210
Right.

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,960
So now if I were to go ahead and save it and come here now, I can see that we get ten.

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,030
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

75
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,120
The reason that we have ten and not 11, because it starts from zero.

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,630
Right.

77
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,110
So we get ten.

78
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,440
So if I click on it, so each time what we get is we get randomized.

79
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,060
Squares, right?

80
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,840
So this is the first example that I wanted to go through to go over now in the second example, what

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,690
I want to do here is now first off, I'm just going to create a comment here so we do not confuse these

82
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,380
examples.

83
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,140
And I'm going to copy this example because it's way similar to this.

84
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,560
Right.

85
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,960
So I'm going to say example to randomizing the color.

86
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,220
How cool is that?

87
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,610
So I'm just going to I'm going to leave that.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,190
I'm going to leave the height and the width.

89
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,450
So I'm going to say randomizing the location plus color.

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,420
So I'm going to leave the X and Y as they are.

91
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,760
What are how can we go ahead and randomize the color?

92
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:25,840
So if I were to say, oh, how can we use colors in Tomalski assess as we have color X codes, we have

93
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:33,460
color names, we have RGV codes or methods for the colors and we have excel for the colors.

94
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:40,940
If you use, for example, color names such as white, blue, violet, coral, indigo, like light,

95
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,960
sea, green or whatever, then you need to create an array and then loop over that array.

96
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,850
And each time this for loop loops over that array, this is going to grab one value.

97
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,860
I mean, that's one way of doing it.

98
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,160
Right.

99
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,670
But instead of doing that, we know that math, that random returns of a number.

100
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,420
So we also know that we have RGV as well.

101
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,760
So what are we going to do is I'm going to say let's read.

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:07,960
Right.

103
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,990
And I'm going to say math dot random.

104
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:20,500
And I'm going to multiply now, what is the range of this red in the context of RGV?

105
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,420
What is the range?

106
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,100
The range starts from zero all the way to 255, so multiply by 255.

107
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,910
But keep in mind, this is going to give us also some decimal points as well.

108
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,540
So I'm going to grab this entire thing and I'm going to say to remove the decimal points and to reach

109
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,170
the nearest integer, we are going to say math, that seal.

110
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,290
All right.

111
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,340
And so this is the red.

112
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,760
Now, we are going to do the same thing for green and for blue because RGV, aside from their color

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,440
like variations, there are logic works in the same way.

114
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,080
So I'm just going to change this to green.

115
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,860
I'm going to change this to blue.

116
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,710
So now we have RGV colors right now.

117
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,420
What I'm going to do here is instead of hard coding like this, we are going to remove that.

118
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,560
And I'm going to use these tactics and I'm going to say RGV.

119
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,210
So what is the first color?

120
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,660
The first color in RGV is red and then put in a comma.

121
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,550
Now, this structure should resemble that, that a date of RGV that we have in excess.

122
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,940
So that is the structure, Rajeeb.

123
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,070
And finally we have our blue.

124
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,309
So now if I save it, we should get random squares with random colors.

125
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,560
Now let's go ahead and let's increase the number to 21 so we get 20 and then we can see.

126
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,400
So if it doesn't matter how many times they refresh, we are never going to get the same pattern.

127
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:59,340
It doesn't matter how many times you refresh, so you get random colors and you get random locations.

128
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,510
Now, for the final four, the final example in this lecture, what I want to do is I want to randomize

129
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,140
the location, the color plus the size.

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,820
So we get squares.

131
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,990
We get rectangles.

132
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:13,770
Right.

133
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,810
So I'm going to come in this one out.

134
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,060
Let's grab this entire thing, put it down here and I'm going to change this to three.

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,220
Randomizing the location, the color plus size.

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,100
Now, that's uncommon.

137
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,950
This is the reason that I'm just copying it, because I don't I don't want to write all this because

138
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,280
it's the same as that one.

139
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,830
So how about the size?

140
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,210
So you can see for the size we have 50 and we have 50.

141
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,170
So basically what we need to do is I'm just going to provide a space here.

142
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,470
So these are the colors and I'm going to provide a space here.

143
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,800
So this is the size I'm going to say let with.

144
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,480
So this is the width of our shape and I'm going to say math round.

145
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,770
We are going to use math the random a lot when it comes to creating games and I'm going to multiply

146
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,640
it by 200.

147
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,590
So the maximum size is going to be 200, right.

148
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,540
And I'm going to the height should be 200 as well.

149
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,640
Now, even though they are, they're going to go to 200.

150
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,060
They're for the most part, they're not going to be the same, like the height and the with.

151
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,130
They're not going to be the same.

152
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,680
Why?

153
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,170
Because this is going to generate a random number.

154
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,280
And this is general this is going to generate another random number.

155
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,760
The chances of this random number being equal to this random number is very low.

156
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,370
I mean, it is possible.

157
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,370
And that's why we have done it like this, because by chance, they could have the same value.

158
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,990
But other than that, I don't want him to have the same value.

159
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,370
And now let's pass the width right here and the heights right here.

160
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,420
Let's save it.

161
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,090
Let's come here.

162
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,200
So now he can see that.

163
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,090
I think in this case, I think that they look the same.

164
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,640
But but I think the height is a little bit bigger.

165
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,360
So it doesn't matter how many times you refresh.

166
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,710
Not only that, you get random locations, you get a random background color and you get random size.

167
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,630
So this is actually how we create multiple things on the screen, right?

168
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,840
And with this, our lecture comes to an end.

169
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,420
See you in the next one.
