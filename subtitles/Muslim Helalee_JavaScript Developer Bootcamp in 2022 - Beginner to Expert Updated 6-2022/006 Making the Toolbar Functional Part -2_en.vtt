00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.550
Hi, everyone, in this picture, we are going to implement the functionality for the color and the

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.110
clear buttons.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.740
All right, so I'm going to come right here and in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.300
a color.

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.360
Color, I'm just going to call it B10, so let's go ahead and let's grab the color B10 and we are going

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.850
to add an event listener to it and we are looking for a change event.

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.090
We are not looking, we are not listening for a click event.

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.060
We are listening to the click event is already implemented using by the Domhnall itself.

9
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.190
So now this click already works.

10
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.510
But we are listening, we are looking for this change of these colors.

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.900
Right.

12
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.600
So when that happens, we are going to run a function, the function is going to take in the event object

13
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.030
as well, and we want to set it to the color.

14
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.010
So initially, the color is right here.

15
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.239
The color is black.

16
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:14.440
But whenever the user selects any color from that color input in the in the drawing toolbar, we want

17
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.740
to set that value to this color.

18
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.200
Right.

19
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.970
So I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.

20
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.190
So in here, what I want to do is, first off, I'm going to go ahead and cancel log something and we

21
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.250
are going to consider log dot target.

22
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.510
All right.

23
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.850
So let's see what this actually gives us.

24
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.320
Let's come inside the inspectors, go to console.

25
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.380
Let's come down.

26
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.050
So when I click here, the event is not fire because this is done by him.

27
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.890
But when I click here.

28
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.440
And click away now, this event is fire, and it shows us that this is the input type of color has been

29
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.790
clicked.

30
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.860
So let's do it one more time.

31
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.680
Let's come here.

32
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.920
And when I click away, the event fires again.

33
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.400
Right, because this color has been changed.

34
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.270
Whenever the color is changing, the event is going to fire.

35
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.259
So click away.

36
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.100
The event fires for the third time.

37
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.430
All right.

38
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.000
So what is it that we want to grab from here?

39
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.540
All right.

40
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.320
So what is it exactly?

41
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.810
So let's go ahead and let's add the value.

42
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.720
All right, let's see what it's going to give us, so let's, for example, put it here and let's click

43
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.040
away.

44
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.870
The value is this hexadecimal color code and this is exactly what we want to print to the screen.

45
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.600
Right.

46
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.600
So how do we do that?

47
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.880
The way we can do that is I'm just going to go ahead and grab all this, copy it and remove it and replace

48
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.650
it with color.

49
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.180
And we want this value to be set for the color.

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.450
We want the color variable to grab the value that has that has been produced by the target that value.

51
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.220
Let's save it.

52
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.460
So let's, for example, grab it, put a put it right there and let's click away.

53
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.430
And now it's exactly that color.

54
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.060
And if we go ahead and if we go ahead and create our console lock, let's put it there and we are going

55
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.920
to create another console log.

56
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.420
And we are going to log the color variable as well.

57
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.500
All right, so both of them should be should be equal.

58
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.650
So when I click away, we can see that the first console log belongs to either target that value.

59
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.820
The second one, which is the value for the color variable, is actually the same thing.

60
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.380
So this color has a code of C seven to two, 30 to three.

61
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.070
Right.

62
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.870
So this is the color code for this color.

63
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.280
So we have successfully implemented the color button.

64
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.760
The only thing remaining here is going to be the clear button.

65
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.030
So this one, whenever we click on it, it should clear the canvas.

66
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.320
So I'm just going to call it clear between first of off, let's grab it and let's add an event listener.

67
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.149
The event that we are listening for is going to be a very, very simple event, which is click.

68
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.370
So when the user clicks, what do we want to do?

69
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.840
I'm going to tell you what.

70
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:36.390
We are going to grab our drawing object and we are going to call a method called Clear Recht or a clear

71
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.260
rectangle.

72
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.400
And what it is that we want to clear, we want to grab the X coordinate and make it zero.

73
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.800
You want to grab the Y coordinate and make it zero.

74
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:56.400
We want to grab the canvas that with and clear that and we want to grab the canvas that height H Eigsti

75
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.790
and we want to clear that as well.

76
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.540
So let's go ahead and draw something and let's click on the clear, it does not work.

77
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.270
Let's see what's the problem.

78
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.760
So we have successfully this is the clear button.

79
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.980
We are listening for a click event.

80
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.900
Right.

81
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.280
And when the when this clear button is clicked, we want to grab our X object and we are going to call

82
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.280
a clear rectangle method and we are going to grab the X and Y coordinates and make them zero.

83
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.720
We are going to grab the canvas that with and this is the misspelled right there.

84
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.450
Canvas that height, save it.

85
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.590
Let's draw something and let's click.

86
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.210
It is clear.

87
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.330
So now let's go ahead and let's play around with this a little bit and let's go blue.

88
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.400
I think it's right.

89
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.640
Hi.

90
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.620
What is this?

91
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.810
Move it.

92
00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.160
It's increased to there and it's put it to this color.

93
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.600
Let's say they're high.

94
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.150
They're very terrible.

95
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.570
I know.

96
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.160
Let's go ahead and let's decrease it.

97
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.670
And that's right.

98
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.390
How you OK, how?

99
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.020
What is that just going across it?

100
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.410
Unfortunately, we do not have a rubber.

101
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.180
How you doing?

102
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.390
How you doing?

103
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.600
And let's put in an apostrophe and a question mark.

104
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.780
The reason that my handwriting is very, very terrible is because I'm holding the mouse with my right

105
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.700
hand and actually I'm a lefty.

106
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.780
So that's why this is very, very terrible.

107
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.140
I'm a lefty and I hold a mouse and my right hand.

108
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:57.360
That's why I cannot do very well if I were to do it with my left hand because I'm left handed and I'm

109
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.470
completely lefty.

110
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.880
Right.

111
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.800
So that's why this is looking very terrible.

112
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.310
And it doesn't matter because this is fully functional.

113
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.150
It works.

114
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.340
Right.

115
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.730
So clear.

116
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.170
This is going to be it for this project and this chapter.

117
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.090
See you guys in the next one.
