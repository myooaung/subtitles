00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,370
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,900
In this lecture, we are going to instantiate our classes.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:15,230
All right, so first off, before doing that, let's go ahead and let's log to the console, what we

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,970
are going to get.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:25,820
So superhero name, we have superhero universe, superhero power.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,710
Where is it?

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,710
There we go.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:37,140
So if I click, if I see Superman and say DC and say Fly click, we get Superman D.C. fly.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,200
So we were successfully, successfully able to grab the content that the user is writing.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,030
Now, what we need to do is just grab this content and put it right here.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,650
I mean, like saying it is way easier than actually implementing it.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,630
All right.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,500
So first off, what we are going to do is we are going to instantiate.

14
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,580
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:07,580
I said it instantiating this is the correct verb that you have to do the you have to say whenever you

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,670
want to, like, wake a class up like that sort of thing.

17
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:19,400
So it's instantiating the superhero entry and class.

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,760
So I'm going to say const entry.

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,620
Okay, come on buddy.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,220
Const entry and I'm going to say new.

21
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,500
We know what new is, what new does.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,540
I'm not going to go over it any more.

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,360
We are going to say superhero entry and now this superhero true class has been instantiated.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:46,760
OK, and the next thing that I want to do is I want to instantiate the superhero list as well.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,720
So superhero list, let's come down here.

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,870
We are going to say consed last new superhero list.

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,190
Perfect.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,800
This has been instantiated as well.

29
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,550
All right.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:10,699
Now, what I'm going to do here, because we still have time, is I want to go ahead and I want to create

31
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:18,330
our very first method, our very first function for the superhero list right in here.

32
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:29,140
So now that the superhero list has been instantiated, we can go ahead and set list dot at Super Hero.

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,860
I know we have not called it yet, but we sorry, we have not defined it yet, but we can call it here.

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,230
Right.

35
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,200
So this is going to be the first method of this superhero list class, which is this one.

36
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,560
All right.

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,680
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come come in here.

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,600
Now, before going there, I just want to console logit, I want to console less, let's see what we

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,420
are going to get.

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,440
So if I click on this list, that ad is not a function ad super.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,640
We have not defined it.

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,030
So let's go ahead and let's define so in here.

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:14,920
I'm going to say ad super hero and we are going to pass an entry excuse me, because.

44
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,830
Ah OK.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,790
So the reason that we are going to pass an entry because that entry is actually an instance of the superhero

46
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:34,000
entry class and we have we have said that the superhero name and the superhero universe and power,

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,530
we have said this, that these so the values for these are actually going to be supplemented from here,

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
instantiated into entry.

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,530
And they are going to go up there.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,410
Right.

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,210
So.

52
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,080
Now, this is not going to work like this because we need to pass and the arguments as well, so the

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,710
arguments for these is going to be a superhero name.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,830
I'm just going to copy it so you know, where where they're coming from.

55
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,880
So it's going to be a superhero name.

56
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,910
And now you can see that they are being highlighted because we are calling them when it calls something

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,850
in JavaScript is going to it tends to wake up.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:20,399
So now, whenever we say superhero name is Superman, Superman is going to come down here and then in

59
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,430
the instance of this superhero entry and this instance of this superhero entry is going to pass it all

60
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,240
the way here.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,940
And we are going to say this superhero name is going to be Superman.

62
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,740
So this in this case is going to be pointing to is going to have a value of Superman.

63
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,720
All right.

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,520
So that's going to be actually ad for this one in the next lecture.

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:50,230
I'm going to create this ad superhero entry, and I hope I'm not going too fast for you.

66
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,950
That's why we are breaking down these lectures.

67
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,020
See you guys in the next chapter.

68
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,510
Next lecture.
