1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,290
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,670
In this lecture, we are going to implement the functionality of this project.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:07,920
All right.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:16,129
So and the first thing that I'm going to grab, the first HTML element that I am going to grab are are

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,630
going to be actually our sections.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:26,460
And I'm going to say document dot, query selector all because we have more than one section as I want

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,710
this to be like accessible.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,110
Whenever you want to create your website, whatever you want to incorporate it in your website, then

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,680
I should I should say all sections, because definitely in your website you're going to have more than

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,880
one section, right?

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,910
And we are going to grab them by their element names, which is section, and then I'm going to grab

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,010
our our chance as well.

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,010
This is the dif the empty diff for which we have that background color.

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,300
This is actually the background color of the death for which we have that background color.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,030
And we are going to say document that query, select tau, not all just simple query selecter.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,800
And what is the class name.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,290
It is trance like transition, that sort of thing.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,380
I couldn't come up with a better name.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:23,050
And then we are going to have an array of our gradients for which I'm not going to type out.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,290
The array of the color names are really difficult to type.

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,890
I'm just going to post it here with Korrell Char to use I think chocolate and we have created blue.

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,120
Let's save it.

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:41,470
So we have selected our sections, the the thing that we want to transition and the color that we want

24
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,150
to transition with that thing.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,010
All right, so what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to create a constant and it is going

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,580
to have a value, the constant name is going to be options.

27
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:01,210
And this is going to be an object because I want to give it a threshold and the threshold is going to

28
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,560
be zero point seven.

29
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,930
And you might ask, OK, what is this?

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,240
What is you know, what the option is?

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,380
You know what the object is?

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,240
What is what is the threshold?

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,360
The threshold basically specifies where we are in that section to be able to see that.

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:26,410
Come on, buddy, where we are in that section to make sure that that chance is actually flipping from

35
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,250
home to about.

36
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,910
So whenever we go to almost 70 percent of that section, see, so almost 70 percent.

37
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,080
Come on, buddy.

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,890
And now this is almost so from here to here, we are almost in the 30 percent of this section, so when

39
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,870
70 percent of the section is passed, we are going to switch from one color to the next.

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,620
And so this is the four full 100 percent.

41
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,060
If we come down here.

42
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,720
So round about here, we should be able to see the color switch.

43
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,120
And there we go round about there.

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,760
And in this image, we should see it round about this this line in here.

45
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,970
So round about here, we should see the color switch.

46
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,790
And this is the threshold that we give it to see.

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,150
And when we go up, it is basically the same thing.

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:25,590
So this actually means that before reaching that section, we want to change the the the we want to

49
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,290
switch the image before reaching that.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,040
So if I put it to point nine and seven and then when we come here, we are going to go really, really

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,830
close to that section, then it is going to switch.

52
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,370
So before it's switched here, but now it switches here.

53
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,560
So this is completely up to you where you want to put it.

54
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,660
This is why we have a threshold.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,670
This basically says where we are in the page and in that section, where do we want to change it?

56
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,270
Now, we have created our threshold.

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,880
Let's go ahead and let's use it.

58
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,730
So I'm going to say that observer equal to this is our observer pattern.

59
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,060
And we are going to see a new intersection, observer, inter section observer.

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,250
This is our intersection observer.

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,690
And now in here, we are going to pass in two arguments.

62
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,490
This is the intersection observer.

63
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,339
It does exactly what the name says.

64
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,220
It is looking for any intersection.

65
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,580
And when it grabs that intersection, when it finds the intersection, it is going to do something with

66
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,690
it.

67
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,880
And what is it that is what what is it that this is going to do with that?

68
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,750
And for that, we are going to implement a function.

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,850
And another argument is going to be our options object.

70
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,090
So this options object is called in here as well.

71
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,580
And now this is a function this is our NAV scroll function and this is the thing that this intersection

72
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,830
observer is going to implement.

73
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,320
So now let's go ahead and let's create our function.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,700
So this is the function name is going to be enough scroll.

75
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,740
All right, and I'm going to give it and a parameter of interest.

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,150
Now, what do we want with that dysfunction?

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,450
Do so whenever we scroll up and down, we have multiple sections.

78
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,090
So the ideology is that we have more than one section.

79
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,480
Whenever we scroll up and down, we want to switch the background color for these links.

80
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,140
Right.

81
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,700
So basically what we want is we want to create a for each loop because we are dealing with more than

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,570
one section.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,920
Whenever we're dealing with more than one element or one thing, then we are going to create a for each

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,220
loop.

85
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:52,880
So this is going to be our forest for each loop and then we are going to give our for each loop a variable,

86
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,420
I'm just going to call it entry.

87
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,210
And whenever this entry variable loops over these sections, what do I want to do?

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,060
So first things first.

89
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,010
I just want to go ahead and I want to consider log the same entry.

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,880
So now we can see what is actually the nature of this loop variable.

91
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,580
So we are going to come here and I'm just going to do this.

92
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,440
So there are next to each other and we can, I think, know we are going to need the full with.

93
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,790
So if we come here and go to the console, we don't have anything.

94
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,500
So if we come here, come down, we still don't get anything.

95
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:39,550
We should get something I mean, let's go ahead and let's open it with Life Server, we should see something

96
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,450
in the console.

97
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,460
Life reload is enabled and we don't see anything in the console.

98
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,450
That's KLECK.

99
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,100
And I think we need more code.

100
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,510
This is this function is going to run.

101
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,580
This is the concept of lock.

102
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,950
All right, so.

103
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,590
I'm going to reload it one more time.

104
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:12,700
And let's go to our console and we should see something whenever we cross the intersection so we have

105
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,450
our function, the function name is Snarf Scroll and the parameter is entreats entries that for which

106
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,360
we run a function and the function parameter is entry, which is the loop variable, and we log the

107
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,840
entry.

108
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,150
So whenever we scroll the front the sections, we should see something here.

109
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:40,540
But oh, the problem is here that this foreach this entry, it has no idea that it should observe something.

110
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,090
Now this observer has no idea that it should observe.

111
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,040
So we are going to say sections dot for each.

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,080
All right.

113
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,820
We are going to add another for each year.

114
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,860
And when the foreach runs, we want each section to receive the following code or to do the following

115
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,250
thing.

116
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,630
And we want to grab what is grip.

117
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,270
It's like Øvrebø.

118
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,780
We want to grab our observer and we want to tell it to observe.

119
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,640
Now, this is remaining because it's not actually observing our sections.

120
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,020
Whenever it observes the sections, then it is going to log something and we are going to use this information.

121
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,290
So I'm going to trash it.

122
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,260
So if I go up, if I go down, we are going to see a lot of information here and we are going to go

123
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,590
over this information.

124
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,080
All right.

125
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,659
And what information or what kind of information from here we are going to use.

126
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,409
So I'm going to just go ahead and we need one of that.

127
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,700
So if I click here now, you guys can see where we actually get the bounding plates rectangle, which

128
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,540
which actually gives us the X Y the with a lot of information in here which which actually we're going

129
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,510
to use in our gallery carousel, this method.

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,010
All right.

131
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,010
And then we have intersection ratio, intersection rectangle is intersecting true.

132
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,360
It is intersecting.

133
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,230
We are going to use this is intersecting at the end in this function, in this nouf scroll function.

134
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,870
But what do we want to see.

135
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,890
What what is it that we want to grab?

136
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,080
This is actually what we want to grow.

137
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,380
This is the target.

138
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,790
So whenever we cross any any element, we are going to grab a target for that.

139
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,870
So let me try it and let's come down so we can get only one.

140
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,750
So now we got this one.

141
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,660
So if I come here, it's a section at home because this is the section, the home section that we are

142
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,240
crossing.

143
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:48,490
So if I come down, we are going to get another one, which is actually this should be the section Daraban.

144
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,950
So this is what we are looking for.

145
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,560
So it is the entry, the target.

146
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,230
It is the target property that we want.

147
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,470
And what is the class name for that target property.

148
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,140
Let's come here, let's find out the class name.

149
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:10,240
So the class name is about we are going to grab this class name because whenever the class name is about,

150
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,420
we want to add a background image to it.

151
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,890
So we are going to grab our entry and we are going to say grab the target and inside, oops, I should

152
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,780
not be there.

153
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,640
This is an entry.

154
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,820
When it is, we are going to grab the entry and we are going to say the target property and from there

155
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,710
the class name.

156
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:40,530
And we are going to store this inside a variable of concept class name as well.

157
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,610
So we are just going to call it class and we are going to store it inside here because we are going

158
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,450
to use this class it that said for this lecture.

159
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,560
See you guys in the next one where we continue making our Navar effect.
