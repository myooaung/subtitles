1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,740
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to persist our data to local storage.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,070
All right, so first off, what I'm going to do is we are going to grab a V. to do items that are printed

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,810
on the screen.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,540
For example, if I come here and if I add, like, read that book.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,590
Read the book that you didn't read, read that book.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,710
OK, why do I say save should click on this?

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,350
So this is our data right now.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,280
We need to grab this data and we need to store it inside the what is the name, the local storage.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,080
So it is inside the application.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:52,340
And if we just expand it to right to our application does not break.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,950
And if we come here, we don't see anything in here.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,580
Right.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,090
We see there is something here, but we don't see anything inside the first application inside here.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,740
So we need to save it here.

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,120
And why do we need to save it?

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,200
Because whenever we relook, reload the page and when it is saved here, it is going to stay here.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,270
So the first step is to save it to the local storage.

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:24,290
The second step is to retrieve it from the local storage to in technical terms, the first step is to

19
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,030
persist to local storage.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,970
The second step is to retrieve it or to grab it from the local storage.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:40,060
OK, so we are going to add it to local storage wherever we updater to do item.

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:46,940
So the first the first place that we are actually a to do item is whenever we call an event listener

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,870
on the key app sorry, on the enter key and on the R to do add button.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,240
So this is where we add our input also.

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,590
This is where we update that input.

26
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:09,740
This is whether we are whether we say that it are the what do I say about what do I want to say, whether

27
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,750
it is a completed task or whether it should be removed.

28
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,200
So we are going to persist at the local storage in two places.

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,430
All right.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:33,120
And I'm going to say persisting to local storage or updating the local storage array.

31
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,600
So did it is it correct?

32
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,950
Yes.

33
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,690
So what we are going to do is we're going to call a method called Jason that string ify.

34
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,320
And I'm going to tell you why.

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,030
So we are going to say for a setting, for providing something to local storage, you are going to call

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,840
that local storage and we are going to set item.

37
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,640
OK, so this is the method for that.

38
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,660
And it says the first value, the first one is key is string.

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,330
The second one is value string.

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,680
So we have a key and we have a value.

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,430
So we have a key value pair like an object.

42
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,780
OK, now it says sets the value of pair identified by key to value creating a new key value pair if

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,710
nonexistent.

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,260
None existed for the key previously.

45
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,800
Right.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,980
Just forget the rest of them in here.

47
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,190
What is the key that we want to provide it with?

48
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,910
The key is a brand new key that I'm just going to create here.

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,890
It is the to do item and now it says the next thing we should provide it with the value.

50
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,800
The value is going to be Jason or AJ.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,480
So on that string of Afie and what is Gesang?

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,150
That string of I, you know, actually I'm not really sure how this is spelled.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,950
Sorry how this is pronounced.

54
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,220
Some people, they call it Jason, some people call it Jason.

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,950
All right.

56
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,440
So feel free to call it whatever you want as long as you understand what this, Jason, that if I does,

57
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:08,060
I think Jason has a better string to it than has a better ring to it than Jason.

58
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,780
All right.

59
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,000
So like like think of it like this.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,620
Maybe like you have a name.

61
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,070
An English name that is Jason now, this is called Jason, you never see Jason.

62
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,839
Hey, Jason, come over.

63
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,980
You say Jason.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,300
So keeping in mind like this terminology, you should say, Jason, you like this methodology of pronunciation.

65
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,150
Pronunciation.

66
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,900
So what what does Jason, Jason or Jason does?

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,240
If I do, it grabs a JavaScript object or value and it converts it into adjacent string.

68
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,950
And whenever it converts it to that, then we can store it somewhere.

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,640
Right.

70
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,400
Either that is a database or a very simple basic local storage of the browser.

71
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:52,920
Right.

72
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,870
So before saving it, we need to convert it to a language that the local storage understands, and that

73
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,300
is the adjacent string.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,880
All right.

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:09,590
So whenever we want to store it to the local storage, we need to convert it to the Jason language.

76
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,710
And whenever we want to grab it from the local storage, we need to convert it to the JavaScript language.

77
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,590
Think of it like this.

78
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,040
So we are going to say to do content or what is it that we want to persist to our local storage?

79
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,190
It is going to be our to do container.

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,740
I'm going to copy this line.

81
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,000
Right.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,240
And I'm going to come down here and I want to add it to here as well outside the if statement, of course.

83
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,330
So we're going to add it here, because this is where we update our ally as well.

84
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,150
So technically, you know what?

85
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,290
And I'm going to grab this.

86
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,860
You are.

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,680
And where is the first place?

88
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,640
Hmm.

89
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,650
Excuse me.

90
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,420
So sometimes I do this.

91
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,190
So let's face it right here.

92
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,040
And this is in case you are a very, very serious developer.

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,150
I'm just getting this is for your reference.

94
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,450
You can go to it.

95
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,970
So let's come here now, we are inside this local storage, let's say hi, local storage.

96
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,340
Save it while we see that we have a key and we have a value.

97
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,690
So it is a set of key value pairs.

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,760
Keep that in mind.

99
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:29,410
And when I click on it, it says name is high local storage idea zero because we want it to be zero.

100
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,930
And if I click on this, we get exactly our object.

101
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,950
Whereas this object located inside our code, I'm going to tell you where.

102
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:46,500
It is going to return to us this because this is the object that we have pushed to this to do container's

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,730
array and if you remember correctly, to do container is an array inside which we have pushed in object.

104
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,180
So it is it's like this one.

105
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:05,460
So if I copy that and if I put it inside here, so inside our local storage, we see the same result

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,990
as I've just done here.

107
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,680
All right.

108
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,680
So we have an array and inside the array we have an object and the object has a set of key and value

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,280
pairs.

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,830
So we we have exactly done that.

111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,260
Local storage.

112
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,380
Very, very simple.

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,240
Right.

114
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:30,870
So we can see that the done is false and OK, the done is false and our high local high local storage

115
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,350
is gone.

116
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,650
So if I click on the.

117
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,090
And this one we can see that Al's idea zero done is false.

118
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:46,140
If I click on this to do complete and it says that done is true because we have just clicked on it and

119
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,710
if I click on the trash it is going to say trash Asatru.

120
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,680
So it automatically is updating that.

121
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,890
And where is this update coming from?

122
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,170
It is the last place where we add it.

123
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:04,010
So if I just do this and if we come here and that's how can we remove it like that?

124
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,760
So if I say hi L.

125
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,050
S and if I click on and click here.

126
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,120
So this is what we have.

127
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:19,530
If I click on this, we can see that the done is still false because we have not added the local storage

128
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:19,800
there.

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,620
We did added, but we commented out.

130
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,000
So it's not updating the local storage in this point.

131
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:32,130
So if you do this and save it and come here and do hey, let's not hi.

132
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,730
It's Hey.

133
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,020
So it says hey.

134
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,710
Ls it, is it zero done is false.

135
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,169
True is sorry.

136
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,169
Trash is false.

137
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,520
Click done is true.

138
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,309
Click trash is true.

139
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,180
Very very cool stuff.

140
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,570
I know.

141
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,450
All right, so there is another issue here as well, so we can see that we have won one key and one

142
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:00,170
value, and it's if I click on it in here, we have only one and one idea, and that is the idea of

143
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,450
zero.

144
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,250
So if I had to do one.

145
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,650
We are going to see that here, it says To do one, if I had to do two, are going to see that.

146
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,510
It says to do to so.

147
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:22,170
The problem is when I reload our our page, the the items, they are still the to do items, they're

148
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,490
still inside this local storage, but they have been removed from our.

149
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,180
Let me just reduce this.

150
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,050
They have been removed from this browser.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,260
So how can we retrieve this data from the local storage back to our browser?

152
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,740
How can we do that now?

153
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,530
We have updated the local stories.

154
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,600
Now it's time to grab that update and update our browser once more.

155
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,420
So for that, what I'm trying to do is I'm going to come on top.

156
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,640
And we are going to do things differently now.

157
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,280
OK, so in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment both of them out and I'm going to initialize

158
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,460
them.

159
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm not going to set them to any value.

160
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,760
I'm going to initialize them.

161
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,510
Right.

162
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,540
And I'm going to say let to do container and I'd be initialized.

163
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,280
They don't have any value as of yet, but they are initialized.

164
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,700
Right.

165
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,320
And what we are going to do is in here, in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable

166
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,970
at the variable is going to say to do data, to be able to retrieve data from from the local storage.

167
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,940
You are going to say local storage data, get item.

168
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,340
Now, we said set item when we updated the local storage.

169
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,930
And we are going to say get item.

170
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,310
Get item is just asking us for the key.

171
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,450
What is the key?

172
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,740
The key is to do to dash do dash item.

173
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,250
We know what the key is.

174
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,080
The key is this where it returns the current value associated with the given key.

175
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,850
So we know what the key is.

176
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,070
The key is to do item.

177
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,190
Where is it coming from?

178
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,780
It is coming from right here.

179
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:12,300
Whenever we sit the item to the local storage, we added a key for it so we can we can get it back.

180
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:12,940
Right.

181
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,940
So set item, we give it a key and we gave it a to do container.

182
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:28,380
So whenever we inside our get item method we say give me the value associated with this, with this

183
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,280
specific key.

184
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,600
What is that specifically?

185
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,710
It is the to do item.

186
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,590
So it is going to go inside the local storage and it is going to retrieve the value associated with

187
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,430
this to do item.

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,450
Now let's go ahead and let's see that in action.

189
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:50,250
So I'm going to first off, I'm going to add an if statement because I want to make sure that that our

190
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,990
local storage is not empty.

191
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,040
So I'm going to say to do data.

192
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:05,540
OK, so f to do data is true, it means that it is not empty, OK, if it is empty, I do not want anything

193
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,360
from the local storage because there is nothing to grab from the local storage for that.

194
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,560
For this to work, we need to add an F because we want to check.

195
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:23,120
OK, so if it is true, it means that there is something inside the local storage.

196
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,260
If there is something we want to gravois to do container.

197
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:32,450
Remember we have initialized our to do container right here, but we have not added, we have not specified

198
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,140
any any value to it.

199
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,680
So what is going to be the value.

200
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,170
The value is going to be Jason that pass.

201
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:49,710
Not paranoid pass, and what does it have to pass, it should pass the to do data because to do data

202
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,090
why?

203
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,810
To do data.

204
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:00,330
To do data is the variable that stores the items value that we have that we want to retrieve from the

205
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:00,990
local storage.

206
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:09,270
So this part of this this entire variable is going to give us a value and we have stored that value

207
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,820
to this to do data.

208
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:18,240
And now because that value is in Jason's language, we need to convert it back to JavaScript.

209
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,920
And for that we use a pass method and the pass method is right here.

210
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:33,060
So, Jason, that pass method passes adjacent string const constructing the JavaScript value or object

211
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,920
described by this string.

212
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,590
So to round everything up, we had a.

213
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:49,280
We had an era in which we had like a set of like we had an array of objects, right?

214
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,320
We converted, we were on we wanted to save that inside our local storage.

215
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,590
So we converted that to Jason language.

216
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,270
And now we have lost our array.

217
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,910
All right.

218
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,990
We have lost it.

219
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,510
And we are asking Jason, please give me my array back and the Jason.

220
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,410
And in order for me to understand Marrara, because my array has been converted, my object has been

221
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,140
converted to the Jason language, Jason first has to convert it back to my language and give it to me.

222
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,460
So this is what this in the past does in simplest terms.

223
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,650
OK, so we're going to do this.

224
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,200
And what about the idea?

225
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,150
The idea is going to come from our to do container that length?

226
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,460
And what does it mean?

227
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:44,860
It means that we are going to set the idea to the last one, to the last item inside or to do container.

228
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,760
So the idea is going to be to that and we are going to add another function.

229
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,940
It is load to do container.

230
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Now, we have successfully grabbed it from the from the local storage.

231
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,600
What do we do then?

232
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,480
Now I do have my data back.

233
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,580
I need to show it to the user.

234
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,520
For that, I'm going to create a function that says load to do container.

235
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,520
Right.

236
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,000
And what is it that I want to show to user?

237
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,330
It has to do container.

238
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
Very simple, right?

239
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:25,980
And now this load to do function is going to show this to do container to the interface and this to

240
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,110
do container has its data from the local storage.

241
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:30,900
Right.

242
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,440
That's it.

243
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:40,460
And OK, so this is in case the to do data is true, this is in case we do have something inside our

244
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,200
local stories.

245
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:49,430
But in the case that we do not have anything inside our local storage, what do we want to do that then?

246
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:58,220
We want our to do container to be sent to a simple empty array and our I.D..

247
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,520
Come on, buddy, or it should start from zero, right?

248
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:09,740
So in this case, the idea came dynamically from our local storage, but in this case, we set it back.

249
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,190
So this is very, very similar to this one.

250
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,530
Right.

251
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,530
So this we have basically changed it and we have brought it here.

252
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,360
And this is a good thing.

253
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:27,990
Whenever whenever you create an variable and you just initialize it, you did not give it a specific

254
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,540
value.

255
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,580
Now then you can change that value.

256
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,750
And the reason that we have used let here is because you are changing the value dynamically.

257
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,280
If you use const here and here, you're going to see an error, right?

258
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,760
Hopefully.

259
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,770
So let's change it to const.

260
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,060
Let's see if I'm right.

261
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,660
Save it and let's come here.

262
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,340
And it says Oncotype are missing out on fire and the const declaration missing identifier because you

263
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,560
cannot initialize you cannot initialize variables using const.

264
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,530
You cannot do that you cnr right.

265
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,920
And this is what I'm talking about because whenever you initialize that variable with the constant variable,

266
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,800
it means that you're going to change the value and const does not let you do that.

267
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,829
Let is going to let you but const is not going to let you.

268
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,640
So we should be good so far.

269
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,460
All right.

270
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,190
So.

271
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,460
Now, the final thing that I want to do is in this lecture, I'm not going to wrap it up, even if it

272
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,930
gets to 20 minutes.

273
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,120
I want to create my load to do container function.

274
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,050
I want to do something useful in this lecture so loath to do container function.

275
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,770
And we have passed an hour to do container as an argument and the function call.

276
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,970
So what is the to do container to do container is basically an array.

277
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,990
So when it is an array we can add, we can apply the for each method on that array.

278
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,090
So remove that from there so you guys can see that it uses an arrow function.

279
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,190
We are going to remove that.

280
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:15,310
We're going to use our very regular overused function and we're going to say item we are just so this

281
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:22,990
item is a function parameter or the array or the for each lupe's variable, which is going to loop over

282
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,580
and in here we are going to call our add to do function.

283
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,650
What is the add to do function.

284
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:35,050
The add to do function is the first function that we are the recreated and inside the add to do a function.

285
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,330
We have created our dynamic element.

286
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,340
Whenever we call that function, it has four parameters.

287
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,130
So we need to add four.

288
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,150
I like respective.

289
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:54,250
Arguments, so the first argument is going to be item Dutney, the second one is going to be item DOUT

290
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,040
I.D. The third one is going to be item dot done.

291
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,480
And the fourth one is going to be item trash.

292
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,200
We are not going to hard code anything, they're not going to give it a name.

293
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,500
And I'd done any trash because that is going to come for that is going to come or that is going to be

294
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,410
retrieved from the local storage.

295
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,600
So doing this, we should be good.

296
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,360
We should be able to do something useful.

297
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
So let's reload.

298
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,930
That's how can I remove these?

299
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,010
Let's remove them.

300
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,750
Let's reload the page.

301
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,640
Let's let's go into our local storage.

302
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,930
We do have some stuff here.

303
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,520
So let's clear everything.

304
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,930
So everything's clear I'm going to say to do you know what I'm going to say?

305
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,630
Watch.

306
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,450
John WEC.

307
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,110
Right.

308
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:57,420
So it was John Wick, we can see that our local storage has been added, has been updated accordingly.

309
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,450
Now I think it's delayed, selected clear all now everything's cleared.

310
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,070
So let's clear this one as well.

311
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,930
All right.

312
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:16,670
So I'm going to say watch John Weck say that this is our why are the rest of them there anyway?

313
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,290
Refresh.

314
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,070
Refresh.

315
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,980
It's, uh, scrub this.

316
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,560
Deleted and her options deleted.

317
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,320
Come on, buddy, don't do this.

318
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,530
Hey, Ali, we still get it and oops, everything is removed from here.

319
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,430
Gosh, what should I do?

320
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,790
The way that we can select them again, we can grab them from our local storage is.

321
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,000
Um hmm.

322
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,140
We should be able to see them.

323
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,620
I mean, I don't know what's wrong here.

324
00:20:51,830 --> 00:21:02,310
So let's come back into our ad to do we have added the name ID item items done item array.

325
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,320
This is going to push this into this load container.

326
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,170
The load container is going to be from here.

327
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,890
And hmm.

328
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,700
All right, so, uh.

329
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,720
Oh, because we have we have removed everything from here, that's why we cannot see them.

330
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:27,800
So now the trash is true, that's why they're not coming back, because it says the trash is true.

331
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,350
So let's clear everything.

332
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,430
Let's do something else.

333
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,060
Let's do to do is to save it.

334
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,900
I know we can see the rest of them.

335
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,690
And in here, if I click on this, it's done.

336
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,230
It's true.

337
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,770
We will be able to remove this in one way or another.

338
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,190
So it says done is true, trash is false.

339
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,160
If I trash it, then it is going to go away.

340
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,760
The thing is, I should be able to reload the page and this should stay here.

341
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,150
So if I reload the page, it is still it is still here.

342
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,530
I'm going to close this page.

343
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm going to come I'm going to come into my e-mail open of a life server because it is saved inside

344
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,950
a database.

345
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,650
We can see that to do is cool.

346
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:17,310
And if I click this and then remove it, reload once more, we can see that it is off, obviously persisted

347
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,970
accurately to this local storage because it doesn't matter what we do, it is going to give us this.

348
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,810
OK, now it doesn't matter how many times you reloaded, you can use it as a mini application for yourself.

349
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,770
You can create a to do list, you can add twenty items.

350
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,970
And when you cross them and when you close the application, turn off your computer.

351
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,350
If you come back and just open it, there are always going to be inside this local storage.

352
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,960
You can use it as a mini web like like a webapp sort of thing.

353
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,610
It is a web app, of course.

354
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,960
And the final thing that we need to do is just go ahead and add the clear functionality, which I'm

355
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,640
going to do in this lecture as well.

356
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,820
So I'm going to say clear the local storage.

357
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,960
So for the clearing that I want to target this button.

358
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:17,040
So whenever I click on this trash, this cloud trash, I need to be able to create clear everything.

359
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,720
So we have already selected that inside our clear button.

360
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,470
So I'm going to grab it and I'm going to add it here.

361
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,640
And I'm going to say that add event listener and the event that we are listening for is a click event.

362
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,190
And when the click event happens, we are going to run a function, the function.

363
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,700
So what is going to be the function?

364
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,420
The function is going to grab our local storage and it is going to clear it.

365
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,070
We're going to use the clear method.

366
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,340
We also want to reload our Web page.

367
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
So for doing that, we are going to say location, reload.

368
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,190
So now we should be able to do what we want, so if I come here and if I click on it now, everything

369
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,890
is gone.

370
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,250
So if I add one to three and if I come here, you can see that we only have one, two, three, we don't

371
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,260
have anything else.

372
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,560
So if I click, everything is gone.

373
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,240
So let's go ahead and let's close everything up.

374
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,940
Let's reload our Web page.

375
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,230
And I could say a reload or I could just close this.

376
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,800
This is the finished project right here.

377
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,610
It's just finished project.

378
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,190
I could double click on the index and we should see our project.

379
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,640
So now let's test it out.

380
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:37,110
This is the first to do.

381
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:47,000
Created by a wonderful person, save it, so it says this is it to do.

382
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,540
This is the first to do created by a one created two to a wonderful person.

383
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,980
Anyway, OK, so let's go ahead and let's inspect it inside our local storage at the same time so we

384
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,120
know it works properly.

385
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,710
So in here, what we have is this is our local storage and it says that this is the name.

386
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,150
The name is very long.

387
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:19,350
I mean, let's remove everything and let's say to do first or one or initial set.

388
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,690
Good.

389
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,000
We should be good.

390
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,220
Still long, but OK.

391
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,460
So to do first or one of initial we have an idea of zero done is false.

392
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,350
Trashiest false.

393
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,730
If I click on this done is true and let's say this is the to do that I wanted to do today.

394
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,650
Let's save it, let's close it, close this, let's open it up again.

395
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,090
Let's open this one again.

396
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:50,320
And if we come here we see that our to do is still completed and it is not removed.

397
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,030
And if we come to application, we can see that the data is still right here.

398
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,490
So let's say for this is the second day that you're using this application.

399
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,930
Excuse me.

400
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,590
And just give me one sec.

401
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,980
All right, so let's say this is the second day that you are using this application and in the second

402
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,780
day you say clean the pool, right?

403
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:27,920
Don't know, like clean the pool, water the flowers.

404
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,850
And then the second day you get a little bit lazy.

405
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,490
You do not clean the pool, which is difficult.

406
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,130
You just water the flowers and that's it.

407
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,250
And this is the third day you come back in.

408
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,880
And whenever you open up your application, your to do list, you can see, oh, I did not water the

409
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,650
flowers.

410
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,180
No, sorry I did for water the flowers.

411
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,560
I did not clean the pool.

412
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,170
I should probably do it today.

413
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,360
So you're going to do it and you still get to do first.

414
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,120
This is something that I did two did two days ago.

415
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,980
Let's clean, let's try it.

416
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:08,600
And then you close it and then you open it up again and you can see that the trash is trashed clean.

417
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,620
The pool is clean.

418
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,260
The water, the flowers are water or the water is a flower and everything is done.

419
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,430
Then you go ahead and clear everything when you come to inspect and you check it out.

420
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,650
Nothing is inside the local storage.

421
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,890
So this is going to be it for our application.

422
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,210
I hope you have enjoyed it.

423
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:32,450
It was a longer one, but again, you should get used to it because we are in the territory of intermediate

424
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:38,440
JavaScript projects and when we get to the advanced, we are going to get even longer and longer projects.

425
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
See you guys in the next chapter.
