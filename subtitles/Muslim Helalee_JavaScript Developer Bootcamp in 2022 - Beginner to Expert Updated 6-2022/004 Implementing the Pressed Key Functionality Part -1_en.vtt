00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.730
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.029
In this letter, we're going to implement the key functionality for our piano.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.330
All right, so we have successfully implemented the Kleck functionality for the piano.

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.030
Now it's time for the key.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.700
So in order to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the top and I'm going to create

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.530
two more constants because I want to map it to those constants.

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.370
Right.

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.049
And I'm going to say consed right.

9
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.720
And I'm going to create the white keys that we want to play on the keyboard and the Black Keys that

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.680
we want to play.

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.760
Whenever we press on the keyboard, we want this piano to be played as well.

12
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.270
So now let's go ahead and let's think about the variable name, because we have already used our Black

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.620
Keys and our white keys.

14
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.160
We could go ahead and say, like W Keys.

15
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.540
In that case, this would be like a very vague element, like a sorry variable name, we could say.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.720
So let's go ahead and let's we could use them in capital letters as well.

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:18.010
OK, so I could say White Dasch keys, we could I think, no, this is not a valid name.

18
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.250
So what if we we change it to underscore now this is a valid name.

19
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.540
So we could use this.

20
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.210
Now I want to grab all of our keys and I want to store them inside an array so we can access that array.

21
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.120
What we are going to do is whenever we access that array, we are basically we are just going to implement

22
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.740
like an event listener.

23
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980
And we know what what is the event that we are listening for?

24
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.330
It is the key down event.

25
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.200
It is some sort of key event which we are going to use key key down.

26
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.780
So what are the keys?

27
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.170
We knew we should be able to know what the keys are.

28
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.560
So these are the keys.

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.370
It is going to take a very, very long time for me to be able to write them.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:10.220
So it's Z, X, C, V, B and M, so this is C, sorry, Z, X, C, V, B and and M.

31
00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:11.290
All right.

32
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.010
So this is the White Keys.

33
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.450
What are the Black Keys.

34
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.250
So let's change it to black and for the black.

35
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.730
We are going to have S and D and then we have G H.

36
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.060
So this is going to be G and then we have H and we have J.

37
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.950
And where is the J.

38
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.940
And we don't have too much because we have almost seven, we have seven white keys and we have five

39
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.630
black keys.

40
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.380
So we have successfully created these arrays because they are more than one item and we want to create

41
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.490
them and say JavaScript.

42
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.520
So we shouldn't do document because they're not inside document.

43
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.780
We just created them here.

44
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.560
We just created to erase four white keys and four Black Keys.

45
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.670
And I'm going to come way down here and I'm going to say document.

46
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.130
Dot Adamsville listener.

47
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.370
Document that at the center now this event is going to run on the document, so why is that important?

48
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.010
So whenever you're inside your editor and when you type Zella's, you're you're seeing that this piano

49
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.810
is not being played and you have a Z letter right here.

50
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.210
This piano using the keyboard keys is only going to be played whenever you're inside this this project,

51
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.960
inside this workspace, then it is going to be played.

52
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.740
If you're outside of it, it is not going to be played.

53
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.660
So whenever you're inside the document and then pressing keys, then this piano is going to play.

54
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.360
And that's exactly what we want.

55
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.310
So we are going to say document that a development center and we're going to listen, listen, listen

56
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.960
for a key down.

57
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.630
And when the key is down, we are going to run a function.

58
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.250
Let's grab the event object as well as a parameter, because we want to work with it.

59
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.340
So first off, I'm going to create a concept.

60
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.680
Let's let's use that.

61
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.540
We have we haven't used that in a while.

62
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.810
So let's say key is going to be equal to now.

63
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.740
We create a key.

64
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.670
Now, we have created this key.

65
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.490
We do have a loop variable.

66
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.670
But keep in mind that this key is is used as used only for this function.

67
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.100
And this is a very variable, of course.

68
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.680
But this key is a loop variable.

69
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.530
A loop variable is only accessible within that loop.

70
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.090
Right.

71
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.380
So we shouldn't have any conflicts there.

72
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.950
And we are going to set it to eat, let's let's just save it and let's say.

73
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.580
Let me bring it like this so we can see all the other code.

74
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.180
All right.

75
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.100
So let's go ahead and let's say console, dot, lock.

76
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.900
And let's grab the key, let's take a look at it, what that is.

77
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.200
So if I if I come here to the document and when I present our any key that we have.

78
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.070
All right.

79
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.930
So it's only key down.

80
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.690
So whenever you're inside the document and whenever even if you're if you're heading the key, it is

81
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.590
going to do something.

82
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.880
I can show you that, of course, we have our keyboard right here.

83
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.060
So let's click inside the document and click on the we are going to see an event, click on the key.

84
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.220
We are going to see an event, click on the piece.

85
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.750
We are going to see an event file and the key is P. But we do not want the other keys to fire an event.

86
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:50.470
We want only the Zedek CVB and an SD GHG, only these twelve keys to play an event.

87
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.380
And for that reason we have created to erase.

88
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.200
We don't want the other keys to fire an event.

89
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.680
So when I click this, when I press that, we are going to get this.

90
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.850
So let's crack it open.

91
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.440
Let's take a look at it.

92
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.820
And in here, this is where what it gives us.

93
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.870
So this is going to give us the key, which has been pressed, the exact key.

94
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.320
So when I press you, OK, so let's go to their press you it is going to give us you.

95
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.240
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to control the lock key.

96
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.320
Dot key.

97
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.150
I hope you're not getting confused.

98
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.630
This key is our variable.

99
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.020
This key is a property of this event object.

100
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.100
Let's say it.

101
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.560
Let's click on it so we get W and W here because I click on the W.

102
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.470
So now let's go ahead and let's remove this.

103
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.850
I'm just going to go ahead and remove this cancer that log, remove it and I'm going to say e dot key.

104
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.930
So we want to grab the key, let's click and let's press the Z.

105
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.300
So sdf j k l we are going to grab all those.

106
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.420
So now we have successfully we have successfully implemented the key that we want to grab.

107
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.230
So what is it that we want to do next.

108
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.830
So what do you want to do next is we want to access these arrays by their index.

109
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.490
Of course.

110
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.560
Why else would we use arrays?

111
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:34.120
So we are going to say const just say I always misspelled const, I'm going to say white key index and

112
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.760
I'm going to say, so where do the index come from.

113
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.990
Indices come from they're going to come from, from, from our constant, from our array that we have

114
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.770
created there.

115
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.780
So we are accessing that.

116
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.120
Right.

117
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:53.290
This is an array, this is the array name and we are going to say find or index of index off.

118
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.710
So we are going to pass on a key there.

119
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.460
Right.

120
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.700
And let's go ahead and let's consider log the key or the white key index.

121
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.160
So the wide key index card.

122
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.560
So don't log.

123
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.790
So let's put it in parentheses and let's remove this dot.

124
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.680
Let's save it.

125
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.880
So when I click that and when I press each, we are going to see minus one.

126
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.990
The reason that this gives me minus one is very, very, very crucial to this app, which we are going

127
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.110
to discuss in our next lecture.

128
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.410
See you guys then.
