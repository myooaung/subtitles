Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.140
In this letter, we are going to talk about the JavaScript ternary operator.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.820
All right, so the tour operator in JavaScript is another way of writing conditionals, but this operator

4
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.970
only checks for two conditions.

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:30.320
So think of this and if statement, which has an else statement inside of it, OK, a single statement

6
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.980
or think of it as a switch statement, which has a default statement inside of it.

7
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.550
All right.

8
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.230
So the syntax is so this is this is basically the simplest way of checking for two conditions.

9
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.600
And that said, that is the extent of performance that this this operator has.

10
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.470
So if you want to very quickly check for two conditions, you should use this operator.

11
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.370
So the syntax is in this way.

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.500
First off, we create our variable and we set it to some sort of value and we say if score is equal

13
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.200
to 10 F score.

14
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.050
Now, this part is our condition.

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.030
This is our condition, OK?

16
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.210
And we say if score is equal to 10, then a question mark.

17
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.440
Run this code.

18
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.050
All right.

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.080
If it is equal to 10, then run grade A.

20
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.520
And if it is not if it is not equal to 10, again, this is a calling.

21
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.330
Then run the other code.

22
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.840
Right?

23
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.380
That's it.

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.750
That's how simple this is.

25
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.840
And run grade B that says it.

26
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.990
Score is not defined.

27
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.900
OK, let's go ahead and let's define the score variable so we should define the score variable.

28
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.340
This is the value for that score variable.

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.340
So let's initially put it to 10, right.

30
00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.050
So if the score is equal to 10, then Konzerthaus lower grade A and I'm just going to go ahead and zoom

31
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.480
in a bit more so you guys can see this is a colon and these are triple equality.

32
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.789
Basically, here we have our equality operators, our like comparison operators.

33
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.590
And then if the comparison operator is met, then we are going to run this.

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.080
If the comparison operator is not met, then we are going to run this code.

35
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.900
That's how simple the ternary operator is, right.

36
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.840
OK, so I think that's it, I'm just going to go over the syntax one more time.

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.190
So if the score is 10, so we first and initializes score and we set it a variable of score and we set

38
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.880
it to 10, if the score is equal to 10, we want to consider log grid A and if it is not equal to 10,

39
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.020
we are going to run consider log great beat.

40
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.280
Now let's put it to, I don't know, nine.

41
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.170
We are going to see grade B, so this part is going to be any other scenario.

42
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.380
So it doesn't matter if it is 100 and like I don't know, like 115, you're going to see grade B.

43
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.730
It doesn't matter what the score is, as long as it is not ten.

44
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.490
We are going to run this piece because this is only checking for two conditions, right?

45
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.450
Let's put it back to 10, and that's it for this lecture.

46
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.220
See you guys in the next one.
