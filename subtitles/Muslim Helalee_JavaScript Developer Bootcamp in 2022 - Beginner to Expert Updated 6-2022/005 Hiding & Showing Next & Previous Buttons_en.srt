00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,939
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to hide and show Ã…rhus.

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:15,980
All right, so first off, what I need to do is I'm going to go to our next button and we are going

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,320
to apply the Hyde and show arrows there.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,510
And then we are going to play it on the previous button.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,310
We could do all that.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,750
And what we could do is we could not do that and we could just create a function, complete the process

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,680
there, and then just call the function here, which makes the most sense.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:33,960
Right.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,640
So that is actually the professional way of doing it.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,360
And the reason that I did that, that I created the move to image function at the end of the previous

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,150
lecture was to show you how this process works, to show you where those numbers they come from.

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,410
All right, so first off, what I'm going to do as.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,850
I'm going to create a function.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,590
All right, but in real world, this is how it is done.

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,120
So I'm just going to call the real the real world function.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm going to call it the height show, Arrow's very generic name.

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:17,050
And I'm going to call it I'm going to call our const variable and I'm going to name it Height Show and

18
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,190
Rose.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,600
Hijo Ã…rhus, and let's create the function itself, and we are going to have a bunch of parameters here,

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,800
so the first parameter is going to be our images array, then we are going to have our previous button

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,560
because we want this function to be called within the previous button's event listener and we want it

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,860
to be called within the next button event listener.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,540
And we want to grab the target index as well.

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,370
And I'm going to tell you where this target index comes from now in our next button event listener,

25
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,490
we have a next index.

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,780
And in the previous we have a previous index, which we have not used yet.

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,820
This is why we have created this index.

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,070
OK, and you guys can see it's a bit like the color of this is different than the color of this because

29
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,509
this has not been used.

30
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,600
OK, it has not been accessed now.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,420
Instead of calling this target index, the next index or the previous index, we are just going to call

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,270
that the targeting index is the same methodology that we used for naming convention that we use for

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,610
target image, because when we want this function to be universal, we cannot specify.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,710
We kind of like restricted to just the next image or the previous image.

35
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,480
The same goes to this, so whenever we talk about the targeted index in the next button context, the

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,900
targeted index is going to be the next index and the pre and the previous button context, the target

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,640
index is going to be the previous index index, next index index, previous index.

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,420
I keep saying index.

39
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,270
It's not like that.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,380
So we are going to add an IF statement because we want to control the flow of our program.

41
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,150
And we say if the target index is equal to zero, then what do we want to do now?

42
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,690
Let's let's talk about the logic here.

43
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:26,280
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to our finished version and we are going to go to our our

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,510
first image now indices in JavaScript, they start from zero.

45
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:30,830
Right.

46
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,290
So the first image must have an index of zero.

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,620
Right.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,800
And we say when the target index is zero, what do we want to do?

49
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,150
We want to apply the hidden class on the previous button.

50
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,640
And what does the heading class have inside of it?

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,500
It has a display of Ainun inside of it.

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,830
So what does it mean?

53
00:03:51,990 --> 00:04:01,680
Whenever we are on our first image, which has an index of zero, we want to we want to remove our.

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,570
Or disappear or hide.

55
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:13,250
Our previous button, and whenever we are on the last image or a lost index, we want to.

56
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,850
Hide the next button, so actually we are going to have three scenarios, the first scenario is going

57
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,130
to be the first image.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,310
The second scenario is going to be the last image, which is come on, buddy, which is this one.

59
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,930
This is the second scenario.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:40,180
And the third scenario is all the images in between where we have both of our buttons available or shown

61
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,850
on the screen.

62
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,220
So we actually have three scenarios that we have to work with.

63
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,740
So let's go ahead and let's first off talk about the first scenario.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,330
So in the first scenario, when targeting Dix's zero, it means our first images showing we just talked

65
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:55,740
about it.

66
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,990
We are going to say previous button and what do we want to do?

67
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,790
We want to add a clause to it.

68
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,730
And what is the class, the classes headed and what does this mean?

69
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:14,080
It means that whenever we are on our first image, the previous button is going to be headed and the

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,520
next button.

71
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:24,320
Is going to have a class list and we are going to remove in case it has that class.

72
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,530
We are going to remove the class of heroine from it.

73
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,500
So this is our first scenario in the second scenario.

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,530
What do we have is whenever we are on our last image.

75
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,120
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to grab this target index and I'm

76
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,150
going to post it right here.

77
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,910
So how can we grab the last item of an array?

78
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,300
We don't how can we do that?

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,820
We access the array and we say depth length.

80
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,990
And what is the last item or what is the index?

81
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,070
For the last item, we just add minus one.

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:04,140
So minus one is going to give us the last index for the last item in an array.

83
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:11,180
We have talked about this, how we can get the last item within an array and if the target index equals

84
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,510
to the index of the last image.

85
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,100
Now we have 10 images in this array.

86
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,440
Right.

87
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,730
So the last image is going to be image number ten.

88
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,160
But what is the index of that image?

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,390
It's going to be nine because length is always one more than the number of images sorry, one more than

90
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,040
the number of the index.

91
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:39,170
So index, the final or the largest index in an array is always going to be one less than the length.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
One less than the.

93
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:49,480
And when this happens, it means we are on our last image, so let's go to the last image and what happens

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,500
in this last image.

95
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,060
The previous button is shown, the next button is headed.

96
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,560
So previous button.

97
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,460
Is shown, it means that we remove the head in class.

98
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,410
And the next button is heaven.

99
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,000
It means that we aren't the hidden costs.

100
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,050
Next.

101
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:29,430
OK, so now two scenarios are done, but what if what if we are in between where we can see both of

102
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,460
our our arrows or both of our buttons?

103
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,970
So what about then, what about in this case?

104
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,010
So what do we want to do in this case?

105
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,390
So in every other scenario and every other scenario means that we are in between.

106
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,480
Either we are on the second slide, third slide, fourth slide, fifth image on the sixth image.

107
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,390
You want to call it damage.

108
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,820
Your slide doesn't really matter.

109
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,490
You could call this a gallery slider as well.

110
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:04,680
The way we use these names interchangeably, even if we are on the image number nine image and image

111
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,140
number eight, image number seven, as long as we are not on the first image and we are not on the last

112
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,900
image, then this else is going to kick in and we are going to grab our previous button and we are going

113
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,190
to say class list.

114
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,280
We are going to remove the head in class.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,350
From the previous button, and we are going to remove the head and glass from the next, but let's save

116
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,640
it and now this function is not going to work because it has not been called.

117
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,929
So let's grab it.

118
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,820
Let's face it, right here and now, inside the function, call less pass in the arguments.

119
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,980
So the first argument that we are going to passant is going to be the images itself.

120
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,840
And what is the second argument is going to be the previous button, then the next button.

121
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,010
All right.

122
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,370
So now let's go ahead and let's pass those in.

123
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,360
So we have previous B10 next veton.

124
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:09,440
Next, Beaton, and after that, we are we have a targeted index, which we had a very long discussion

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,690
about.

126
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,920
So the target, the index and the context of this event listener is going to be the next index.

127
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,900
So I'm just going to go ahead and copy it and I'm going to call it here and I'm going to copy this.

128
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,620
And I'm going to call this function in here as well.

129
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,600
And this is our previous segment, The Listener now Imagists, previous button, next button.

130
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,580
But instead of the next index, we are going to grab the previous index.

131
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,260
Let's save it.

132
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,510
So now.

133
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,490
I mean, right.

134
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:49,020
OK, so for this class to work, we should provide it with a reference, so what I'm going to do is

135
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,520
I'm going to add a button here as well so that BTN that hidden.

136
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,290
Now let's save it.

137
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,110
Let's come here.

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,710
We can we can still see both of our buttons.

139
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:07,170
And, um, let's go ahead and let's remove the B10 from here and let's add it by default, our hidden

140
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,630
button.

141
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,110
Let's save it and let's come here.

142
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
So now you guys can see we are on the first image.

143
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,740
The previous button is has been hidden.

144
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,360
But when I, when I just click on the next button, the previous button comes back.

145
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,910
If I go back it goes away.

146
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,900
It should go away.

147
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,590
Come on, buddy.

148
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,970
It's I think we should reload it and why do we have to reload every time it should go automatically?

149
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,620
So let's take a look at the code.

150
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:42,960
So whenever we are on our previous button, we want to add the head in class to the previous button

151
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,630
on the first target index is zero.

152
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:52,470
And you want to remove it from head entry and remove it from previous added to next, remove it from

153
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,580
both places.

154
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,130
I mean, we don't have any errors here.

155
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,830
This code should work technically.

156
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:07,990
All right, so we have called it images previous previous index and images, previous button and next

157
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,620
index.

158
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,630
So let's say let's open up the live server one more time, it should work.

159
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,370
So let's click on it, it comes and let's go to the last image.

160
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,700
And this one is not disappearing.

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,620
It should disappear.

162
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,640
Save it.

163
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,780
We got our first image.

164
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,910
It does disappear.

165
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,230
Let's go to our e-mail and let's see.

166
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,700
So this is the button.

167
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,330
All right.

168
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,100
We have selected it right here.

169
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,750
It is the button, right.

170
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,880
And this is the bottom left.

171
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:51,440
OK, so what are going to do is I'm just going to open with live server one more time, so if I go there,

172
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,790
it appears that if I come back, it does not go away.

173
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,270
So the rest of the code worked.

174
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,040
So we are going to go inside this next button and now this part doesn't work.

175
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,610
So let's go ahead and let's consider log it.

176
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,410
What is that console.

177
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,240
That log.

178
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,580
Let's grab our next index.

179
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,020
Let's save it.

180
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,490
Let's check it out here.

181
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,820
So if I go into the inspect and if I go to the console, trash everything.

182
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,050
OK, so let's close this one, let's click, we get a negative one, but the index of the next image

183
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,590
is one.

184
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,060
We should not get a negative one.

185
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,030
Negative one is returned whenever there are.

186
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,330
Now, this method runs this find index and it returns to negative one when it cannot find anything right

187
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,380
here, find the index or otherwise find index returns a negative one.

188
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,330
If such an element is found, find index immediately returns that element index.

189
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,100
Otherwise it returns.

190
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,720
Find index returns minus one.

191
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,900
So this clearly doesn't work.

192
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,580
So let's go ahead and let's remove our function.

193
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,470
And instead of our regular function, we are going to use an arrow function, we have not gone over

194
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,100
the syntax yet, but we are going to go over the syntax.

195
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,280
So in here, we are going to use an arrow function and we are going to see if that is going to work

196
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,590
and you are going to basically do the same thing, but save it.

197
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,890
OK, so this is an arrow function.

198
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,390
We are going to go over it.

199
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,640
And now let's click on this.

200
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,880
You can see cannot access this next index before, OK?

201
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,260
It should not be next and it should be next image.

202
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,960
So m m g.

203
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,570
Save it, let's click on it one more time and now we get one.

204
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,560
All right.

205
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,270
So we get two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine.

206
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,550
So the final image has an index of nine.

207
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,110
So now we have successfully been able to grab the index.

208
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,380
So I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to paste it right here.

209
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,040
And instead of next, an image, we are going to see previous image.

210
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,050
And now let's say that that's come here and let's close the console.

211
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,240
So now when I click, the arrow appears.

212
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,490
When I click back, the arrow disappears.

213
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,840
So that was a minor like minor hurdle along the way of coding this project.

214
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,310
And now let's go to the last image and now the last arrow disappears.

215
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,760
As what?

216
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,930
So now we should have used the arrow function in here and when we used it, the problem is solved.

217
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,090
So that is it for this chapter and for this project.

218
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,740
See you guys in the next one.
