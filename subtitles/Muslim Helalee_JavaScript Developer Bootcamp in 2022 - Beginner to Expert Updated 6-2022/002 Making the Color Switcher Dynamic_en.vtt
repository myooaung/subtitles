00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.100
Hi, everyone, in this last year, we are going to implement the functionality of our colors switcher.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.480
All right, so now let's go ahead and implement that.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.730
So first things first, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the body because we are changing the

4
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.050
background colour of it.

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.910
Right.

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.690
So we are going to say document that body.

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.310
This is a special selector in JavaScript in which we through which we can select the body.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
The next thing that I want to select is going to be our button.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.550
And then we are going to selling the paragraph, the button, because we are going to add an event listener

10
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.750
to it, the Parro, because we are going to change the text dynamically to match that of the background.

11
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.630
So whatever the background color is, we are going to grab the the color code, the the the RGV code

12
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.200
for that.

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.100
Right.

14
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.200
So we are going to say consed I'm going to call it switch Beaton's short button for sure.

15
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.620
Button.

16
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.140
You're going to say document dot.

17
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.960
We're going to use our very old query selector.

18
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.850
And by now I'm sure you have mastered the query selector and it has a class of SU which you can always

19
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.790
check whether or not you have got the proper alignment or you have grabbed it properly.

20
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.530
But just consider log in it.

21
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.820
If you consider logs which b10 and you get this, this element of button which is on the screen, when

22
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.790
you get it, it means that you have successfully selected.

23
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.170
Sometimes when the event listeners, they do not work, it's because you have not properly selected.

24
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.330
It may be the class name has not been typed correctly, or maybe it's a IDE name and you have added

25
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.400
a dot or something like that.

26
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.480
And that line's.

27
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.720
Are going to grab the.

28
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.740
The excuse me, the paragraph as well.

29
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:11.840
So we are going to say, so which PEMRA and we are going to say document not to very select and it has

30
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.260
a class of color.

31
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.180
All right, so now whenever we click on the switch button, so the event listener is added on the switch,

32
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.080
but Biton button right button.

33
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.580
And we are looking for a click and we are listening for a click.

34
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.660
And when the click happens, we are going to run a certain function.

35
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.680
Right.

36
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.430
And.

37
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.240
Before actually writing anything in here, first off, I'm going to go down here and I'm going to implement

38
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.460
the random number part for these three color codes for the red, for the green and for the blue.

39
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.800
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another function and I'm going to call it get random

40
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.390
number.

41
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.170
Right.

42
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.500
And we are going to say this function should return math.

43
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.040
This is what we're working with.

44
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.430
Whenever we're working with no random numbers, we are going to say math, that flaw.

45
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.220
So whenever you're working with math, it is going to give you decimal points as well.

46
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.630
And when you say that flaw, you're always going to Florida down.

47
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.650
So if it is three point one, you're going to get three.

48
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.920
If it is three point five, you're going to get three.

49
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.120
Even if it is three point nine, you're going to get three.

50
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.110
So you're always going to come down.

51
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.900
And if you say math, that seal, if it is three point one, you're going to get four.

52
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.720
If it is three point, for example, nine, you're going to get four.

53
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.930
But we are going to Florida down.

54
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.390
We're going to round it down, mathematically speaking, and we are going to say math that random,

55
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.730
so random is a method that is going to give us random numbers.

56
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.820
And we want numbers all the way to two hundred and fifty six.

57
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.740
And why 256?

58
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.320
The reason for that is because we are going to Florida down, so we are going to get two hundred and

59
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.800
fifty five point nine.

60
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.940
So what is it if we, if we rounded down it is going, we are going to get two hundred and fifty five.

61
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:23.730
So because when Y 255, because the range for RGV colors is from zero to 255, that is the ultimate

62
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.090
range.

63
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.030
So we have created our get random number function here and in here.

64
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.970
What I'm going to say, I'm going to call that get random function three times.

65
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.740
Now we have talked about how functions can be postin as arguments and as return values.

66
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.560
All right.

67
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.620
And they're basically called callback functions.

68
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.700
We have talked about them and we are going to pass them three times.

69
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.610
So that's that's number two and this is number three, and you might ask, OK, why three times?

70
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.610
And I'm going to tell you why the first time that this function runs, it is going to give us a random

71
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.860
number for the red.

72
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.880
The second time it is going to give us a random number for the blue sari, for the green.

73
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.260
And the third time that it runs, it's going to give us a random number for the blue.

74
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.590
Now, if you were to add in Alpha Channel to this, then you would have created another another function

75
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.900
and then you would have run that function, because these three, all of them have the same nature.

76
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.540
But as far as the Alpha Channel is concerned, the alpha channel goes from zero to one.

77
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.730
All right.

78
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.320
And but in this case, we just want to add we just want to grab a number.

79
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.640
And the Alpha channel is a simpler kind of idea than this.

80
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.530
You could just add it manually at the end, right?

81
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.540
Now, this this function has been called three times, and each time this function is called, I want

82
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:03.050
to store it within a variable and I'm going to call it variable one, get random number and I'm going

83
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.190
to copy this.

84
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.440
Well, I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to put it here and put it here.

85
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.980
And I'm going to call it variable.

86
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.860
Let's call to add color through it.

87
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.190
So whenever this function is called, I want to capture the result of that function.

88
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.530
So maybe the result of the function is let's come here.

89
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.850
So when I click on it, the result of the first function is 255.

90
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.650
The result of the second function call is to a one and the result of the third function.

91
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.240
Call this 40.

92
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.930
And so no one is going to be 255, color two to one and color three 40.

93
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.510
And when that happens, what do I want to do?

94
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.860
I want to create a color string.

95
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.510
Why do I want to create a color string?

96
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.360
Because I want this colored string to be added to our paragraph.

97
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.310
Right.

98
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.410
I want it to be added to our paragraph.

99
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.830
So the corresponding number should have a corresponding color for the background.

100
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.220
And in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our back ticks or templated strengths.

101
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.760
I know you guys can see how useful they are.

102
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.610
We are going to say RGV.

103
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.940
And we are going to open parentheses, so for these first random number, we are going to add it for

104
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.490
the read.

105
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.130
All right.

106
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.390
And we are going to say color one.

107
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:34.060
And then we add a comma, because in the RGV, whenever you add a number, you pass in a comma.

108
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:43.530
Basically, we are recreating this RGV function in a sense of success in JavaScript.

109
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.230
All right.

110
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.630
And for the second value, we are going to grab the color, too, which is so the first one.

111
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:56.360
It is going to be you know what I'm just going to add to here and this is going to be red.

112
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.870
This is going to be green and this is going to be blue.

113
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:09.300
So I'm going to add color to there and this is going to be our color number three.

114
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:16.840
So now taking a look at this, this is a very, very valid Cyesis property value.

115
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:24.110
So we have another GBE and inside the parentheses, we have three values because the result of this

116
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.950
color, one, two and three is going to be a number.

117
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.820
It's not going to be a string.

118
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.700
It's going to be some sort of number.

119
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:36.559
And when you pass and the number here, you're going to get a valid Cyesis property value.

120
00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.789
All right, and let's go ahead and let's consider logit.

121
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:49.010
We are going to say Colace to Ringa, let's save it, and now let's come in to inspect and let's go

122
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.650
into concern and now let's start switching.

123
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.050
So if I click on it, we are going to get one.

124
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.720
No, this is a random number.

125
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.180
Second, third, the other other other.

126
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.080
So each time we are going to get a random number.

127
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.250
So now we have two things remaining.

128
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:13.400
The first thing is we should pass in or print this number instead of this paragraph.

129
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:20.630
And the second thing is we should change the background color of the body corresponding to that RGV

130
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.720
value that we have.

131
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.360
So I could, like, separate this into two videos, but that's very, very simple.

132
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.740
Basically, we just need to write two more lines of code and that's it.

133
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.750
So first off, let's grab the body and we are going to say style and.

134
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:43.110
We are going to say background, give me color and we are going to add it, we are going to say the

135
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.130
color string should be the background color of the body.

136
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.080
So now if I click on it, we see a different color each time.

137
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.590
Where is the color code?

138
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.010
The color code inside this console.

139
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.360
See, but now the only thing remaining is we want to update this paragraph.

140
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:07.200
So if the color code is 227 138, we want the paragraph to show the same thing.

141
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.600
So let's go ahead.

142
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.960
Let's select our power from here.

143
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.780
And this is super simple.

144
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.450
We have actually done this and we are going to say inner text.

145
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.200
So what should be the inner text of the power?

146
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.590
We are going to say colors string super simple.

147
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:33.830
So now if I click on it, we see 972 one six sixty five here and nine seven two one six five here.

148
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.400
And with this, our project comes to an end.

149
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:44.790
But I'm just going to go ahead and come take the console and let's go full screen and close this and

150
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.590
close that.

151
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.080
And now if I click on it each time, I'm going to get a different background color.

152
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:57.390
So even though this project was very, very simple, we have actually covered a lot in here.

153
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.550
We have talked about the variables.

154
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.130
We have talked about evilness, listeners' functions.

155
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.640
How do we have objects?

156
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.030
No, we don't have any objects.

157
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.260
We don't have any arrays.

158
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.840
But we do have string methods.

159
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.160
We have template strings.

160
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.870
We have our styles.

161
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:18.900
We have our inner inner text and a lot of a lot of things.

162
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.170
And also we have learned a new thing, which is math.

163
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.100
The math object and the math object has properties.

164
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:34.350
One of the properties is certain methods because they are functions actually floor as a method of this

165
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.250
math object.

166
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:42.110
And random is another method of this math object that set for this lecture and for this project.

167
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.630
See you guys in the next lecture and in the next project.

168
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.190
And until then, good bye.
