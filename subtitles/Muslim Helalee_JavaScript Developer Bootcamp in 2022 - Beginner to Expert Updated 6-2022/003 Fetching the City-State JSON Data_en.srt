00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,380
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,060
In this next year, we are going to fetch our data.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,300
All right, so I'm going to go inside the JavaScript file, but before writing anything, we need to

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,210
go over what it is that we want to do.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,370
So whenever we type inside of this input, we want to show some cities, of course.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,460
But so first things first.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,790
We need to grab this input and we need to add an event listener to it that is going to listen for whenever

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:42,360
the user types something so and then that when the user types something, some suggestions are going

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,900
to be shown inside the school.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,340
So we need to grab this input.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,010
And this year.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,900
Well, all right.

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,030
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come here and I'm going to say const all right.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,730
And we are going to call it search input.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:11,190
And document to query selecter, right, and what is what is the class, the classes search and next

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,930
thing, I just want to grab the suggestions as well.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,900
So I'm going to say suggestion's container.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,740
Right.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,460
And you're going to document to query selector and the class is going to be suggestions.

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,950
Suggestions.

21
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,220
All right.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,620
So now we have selected them.

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,260
Now, the event listener is going to be on the input because whenever these are types, something inside

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,250
that input is when we want to show something on the screen.

25
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:41,850
Right.

26
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,000
So the event listener is going to be on the input.

27
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,510
So let's grab the input, search input, add a listener.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,230
So what is the event?

29
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,510
That's the important part.

30
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:01,110
Now, when it comes to inputs, we have a change event and the change event is going to be fired whenever

31
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,670
the input is changed.

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,280
So you write something inside the input and when you click away, then this event is going to be is

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,440
going to fire and then we are going to call a display matches function.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,640
Right.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,420
But so what I'm going to do is I'm going to come here and I'm going to grab this function, display

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,900
matches, and I'm going to basically say cancel log.

37
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,540
In part.

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,750
And third event, fire.

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,590
Let's let's test it out, all right, so let's go into cons. Let's bring this up, maybe put it on the

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,160
side.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,210
That's better, right?

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,750
So if I click here, for example, new, you can see that nothing is being fired.

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,750
But when I click away, you can see that the event is fire.

44
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,610
And that is not something that we want.

45
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,900
Whenever we start typing, we want the event to fire.

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,030
So additionally, we are going to add.

47
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,140
I think it's like that.

48
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,110
Additionally, we are going to add another event listener, and that is going to be on the key up.

49
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:20,110
So whenever the key is up, we want to run this display functions or call that function as well.

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,310
So if I were to say and you can see the event is far different, is fired, W. Devant is far.

51
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,810
So we have successfully implemented this.

52
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,010
All right.

53
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,300
And I'm going to leave this here.

54
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,080
So now let's go ahead and let's fetch the data.

55
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,110
So first off, I'm going to create a constant call.

56
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,350
Cities and cities and states or cities.

57
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,270
States, right.

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,900
So it is going to give us all the cities and all the states.

59
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:50,790
Right.

60
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,110
So it's cities.

61
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,130
What is this?

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,690
So city states.

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,710
And I'm going to initialize it as an empty array.

64
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,640
All right.

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,980
So let's go ahead and let's call our object.

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,330
So what is the URL for this?

67
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,190
The URL is I'm just going to pasted right here.

68
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:09,950
Right.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,010
So that's going to be the URL.

70
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,630
Let's remove both of them.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,290
So this is going to return a promise.

72
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,510
What we can do is we can grab that promise.

73
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,460
And we can change it to something that JavaScript can read, right?

74
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,100
So let's say response.

75
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,330
Jason.

76
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,300
So so far we are not going to see anything.

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,940
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add another dot then and I'm going to say response data.

78
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:50,550
And we are going to say, let's let's go ahead and let's log it to the console console that log response

79
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,770
data.

80
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,980
Let's save it.

81
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,750
OK, so now you can see that we get this function.

82
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,150
OK, this is the function that we have.

83
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,040
So we have a response.

84
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,600
Oh, I forgot the parentheses.

85
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,790
There we go.

86
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,660
So this is the array that we get.

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,610
Now, keep in mind, this area is no longer adjacent.

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,380
It is a valid JavaScript array.

89
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,760
Right.

90
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,970
And you can see that the Proteau says a reservoir.

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,870
And this is like a like a massive array.

92
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,730
We have 1000.

93
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,590
The length is 1000 objects within this array.

94
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,260
So what it is actually that we are looking for.

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:40,320
So if I, for example, go ahead to Phoenix number five, you can see that we have a city, OK, you

96
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
can grab the growth from 2000 to two thousand thirteen.

97
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,400
You can grab the latitude, you can grab the longitude excuse me.

98
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,810
You can grab the population, you can grab the rank, you can grab the state.

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,440
So the data that I want to grab, you can grab the latitude and longitude from here as well.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,190
But I'm not interested in that.

101
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,040
I just wanted to show you that all this data is available for you and you can use this data.

102
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,570
Right.

103
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,850
And this from this data, we are going to grab this property and we are going to grab this property

104
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,030
and we are going to show it on the screen.

105
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,420
So inside this array, what we are going to do is we need to loop over this array or actually what we

106
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:32,020
are going to do is we are going to filter this array for city and for state.

107
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,650
Right.

108
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:40,870
So what are we to do is at this point, what I'm willing to do is I want this array to be pushed inside

109
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,430
this array.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,160
Right.

111
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,780
So I want to grab all the items of that array and I want to put it inside the city state array.

112
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,940
So how it is?

113
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,270
How can we do that?

114
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,610
All right.

115
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:59,110
So if I grab the city state's array and if I say that push and let's put in the response data, let's

116
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,970
see what we get.

117
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,660
And if I push it there, we don't see anything here.

118
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,900
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to cut this.

119
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:18,030
So let's cut it, let's provide the curly braces, let's say Kansa lock, I could do this or I could

120
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,450
just put everything here and then say console.

121
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:30,820
Console, come on, console Deathlok, let's grab the city states and let's take a look at it.

122
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,170
So now you can see that we have.

123
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,760
An array within an array, right, so you can see that this is an array and inside that array.

124
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,830
We have another array that has 1000 objects.

125
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,450
So we have nested this array within that array.

126
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:55,970
That's not something that we want to be able to push the objects from this array into this array.

127
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,350
There is a method called there is an operator called the spread operator.

128
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:10,660
And what the spread operator basically says is that we want to grab the this the data from the array

129
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,070
and we want to spread it just just provide three dots and we want to spread it inside this array.

130
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,630
That's basically what it says.

131
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:27,430
So now if I were to save this and check out a result, you can see that we get the same array right

132
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,790
here.

133
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,530
Right.

134
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,940
So that this array is now you can see that we don't have any array within an array.

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,340
We just have objects within that array and the objects are 1000.

136
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:49,960
So we have successfully retrieved our data and we have pushed it to this city state array.

137
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,690
And now what we can do is we can actually do meaningful stuff with it, which we are going to do in

138
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,450
the next lecture.

139
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,020
So in the next lecture, what I want to do is I want to create a function that is going to find the

140
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,440
matches and we're going to leverage our knowledge of regular expressions, because whenever you write

141
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:16,120
something here, it it this word should match the word which is inside this this string.

142
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,060
And you can see that this matches this.

143
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,600
So some sort of regular expression is involved in this process of matching this.

144
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,080
Yeah.

145
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,390
Here is the Albuquerque.

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,170
It was not a LBA.

147
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,430
It was LBG.

148
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,800
You Albuquerque.

149
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,800
All right.

150
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,570
See you guys in the next lecture.
