Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,230
In this lecture, we're going to talk about the array find method.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:14,840
All right, so the find method returns the value of the first element.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:23,390
Keep this in mind, the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,890
So we are dealing with the testing function once more, but we are just going to grab the first element

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,910
that.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:38,800
The testing function that satisfies the criteria of the testing function, so let's grab our array and

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,330
let's call the find method on it.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,770
So it is going to only grab one of them right now.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,850
Let's passan our.

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,240
Parameter, and that is artist name, so we want to grab an artist's name.

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,590
All right.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,860
So the artist name, dot name.

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,280
OK, or sorry, not name, because in here we don't have a name.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,450
We just have artist.

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:12,510
So we are going to say that artist should be called to, for example, Chuck Berry.

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:13,800
All right.

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,530
If it is equal to that, what do we want to do?

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:23,530
We want to print it to the console, log it to the console and oops, we have not saved this.

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,300
So let's go ahead and let's say artist name, artist artist names.

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,140
And now let's call let's print it artists names, let's save it, and we get Chuck Berry and now imagine

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,140
imagine if there were like another Chuck Berry as well, like like Chuck Berry had another song.

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,440
And I'm just going to put it right here.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,650
So the artist's name is Chuck Berry, but the song is the the second.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:06,090
Come on, second one, and it is, let's say 1959, let's save it, but we still get the artist as Chuck

26
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,530
Berry.

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,770
This song is Johnny B. Goode and year is 1958.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,860
The reason that we don't get this is we just grab the first item that satisfies this condition so we

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:27,290
don't care how many items come come after that, we just grab the first one that satisfies this condition

30
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,710
that set for the array method.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,770
See you guys in the next lecture.
