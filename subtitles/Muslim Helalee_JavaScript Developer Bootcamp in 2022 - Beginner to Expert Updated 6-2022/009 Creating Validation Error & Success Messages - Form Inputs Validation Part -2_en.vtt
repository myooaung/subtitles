00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.210
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.760
In this lecture, we're going to print the validation messages to the screen.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:16.600
All right, so we have created the validation error and the validation success we have called them,

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.370
let's go ahead and let's create them.

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.540
Let's define them.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.560
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say a validation error, validation,

7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:38.290
error function so we could say validation, error function, OK, superhero validation error scrubbed

8
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.300
this function.

9
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.130
Let's put it here and put it here as well.

10
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.880
So let's go ahead.

11
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.610
What is the name?

12
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.410
It is validation error.

13
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.130
There it is.

14
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.560
What do we want to do now?

15
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.420
We have our error right here.

16
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.790
Right.

17
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.480
So this is our error.

18
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.580
This is our error message and this is the success message.

19
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.780
So we have them.

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.970
And in the sixth sense, we have just gone ahead and we have said display none.

21
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.720
I just want to say display block or I can say add this show validation class to this element.

22
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.400
And what is the show?

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.420
Validation classes.

24
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.580
Property is display block.

25
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.390
Very simple.

26
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.610
No need to overcomplicate stuff.

27
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.670
So we are going to say document dot query selector.

28
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.170
Now I am selecting the div which handles the error message.

29
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.090
I'm just selecting that diff.

30
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.250
What is the class name for that div.

31
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.930
I'm just going to copy it from here so you really understand what's going on here.

32
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.850
So let's grab it and we are going to say that class list dot add what is the class that we want to add.

33
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.710
It is the show validation class.

34
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.770
I want to add it right.

35
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.500
So let's come here, let's test it out.

36
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.550
So if I click on it, we see the class has been added, but it has been added.

37
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.889
But we need to remove it after some time.

38
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.220
Right.

39
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.980
So after some time it means that asynchronous programming or a timer.

40
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.060
So we are going to say sit time out and we are going to grab this and whoops.

41
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.550
Let's copy it, put it here, so after exactly two and a half seconds, I want to remove that glass.

42
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.800
I'm just going to say remove.

43
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.260
I can.

44
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.720
Remove it, save it, and let's come here, so click.

45
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.650
Goes away seats after two and a half seconds, it is going to go away and I think two and a half seconds

46
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.420
is excuse me, enough time for the user to read this.

47
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.080
And OK, so this is the validation error.

48
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.030
Let's go ahead and let's create the validation success as well, and it's basically the same thing.

49
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.430
So I'm just going to do this and we are going to say validation, success.

50
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.520
So we are going to grab the validate our success class and we just want to show it on the screen.

51
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.530
And after I yeah, it's one point five seconds, we want to remove it, so let's save it.

52
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.990
First off, let's check.

53
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.610
Validate success.

54
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.250
Validate success.

55
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.520
Yeah.

56
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.220
So the behavior for both of them is going to be the same, so it's validation, error, validation,

57
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.540
success, and let's remove the this one.

58
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.080
So I'm said Super D.C. fly.

59
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.150
OK, let's start validations, success is not a function, oh, it's still validation error.

60
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.940
So success.

61
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.490
So this is the problem with copy pasting.

62
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.090
You need to be really careful.

63
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.900
So now we see superhero outfit and it should go away after one and a half seconds.

64
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:15.160
And the reason that it doesn't go as because now it goes away after and one point five seconds so quick.

65
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:22.360
Goes away, see one point five seconds when I was creating this app, this one point five second was

66
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.450
really very it was very fast.

67
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.010
Now it's like it's staying there forever.

68
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:37.010
Yep, so there we go, we have our revalidation success and we have our validation error, very simple.

69
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:46.280
And what we are going to do in the next lecture is something that we will be talking about in the next

70
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.640
lecture.

71
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.810
So see you guys then.
