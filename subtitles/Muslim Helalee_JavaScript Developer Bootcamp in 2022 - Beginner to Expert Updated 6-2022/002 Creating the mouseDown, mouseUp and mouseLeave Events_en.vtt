00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.710
In this lecture, we are going to implement the necessary mouse events to complete the functionality

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.970
of this project.

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.740
All right, so before going forward, we need to select the slider, so what I'm going to do is I'm

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.040
going to say consed slider and we are going to grab it through the query selector.

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.550
And the slider has a class, which is container.

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.790
And now I want to create a variable which is called is down.

8
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.730
And later on we are going to change the values because according to this is down, we are going to implement

9
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.650
an if statement.

10
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.550
So initially the is down.

11
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.660
It means that the mouse is down or the user has clicked or I shouldn't say click because that is the

12
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.350
click event.

13
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.550
But that's that's actually what happens when Mouse is down.

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.530
OK, and I'm going to initialize a variable called Start X, which which is going to tell us exactly

15
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.450
where the user has clicked and how much the user is moving from one side to the next site.

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.930
And we are also grab the scroll left and we are just going to initialize we are not going to declare

17
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.750
these variables.

18
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.470
So first off, let's grab our slider and let's say at event listener.

19
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.820
So first things first.

20
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.370
What I want to do is I want to implement this functionality.

21
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.570
Whenever the user presses the mouse down, we can see that we go into this cursor grabbing state.

22
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.900
And when the user leaves the cursor or this mouse up, we go back.

23
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.900
So this is the first functionality that I want to implement.

24
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:51.580
So the event is going to be mouse down, let's create a callback function and we are going to pass in

25
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.030
the event object as a parameter.

26
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.730
And whenever the user mouse is down, we are going to say is down is now true.

27
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.420
Right.

28
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.860
And we are going to grab our slider and we are going to go into classes.

29
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.300
And from then in there we are going to add a class.

30
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.389
What is the class?

31
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:15.760
The class is active, so we should have some styling for that active class, which is right here.

32
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.280
So whenever the cursor is in the active class, the cursor itself is going to change from pointer to

33
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.030
grabbing.

34
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.980
All right.

35
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.680
So I you can see that the cursor is grabbing.

36
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.830
But there even though I have released the mouse, the mouse up event is still yet to be created.

37
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.950
So if I go ahead and create that, then we can see that whenever we release the mouse, the mouse should

38
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.960
return back to its original state.

39
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.090
All right.

40
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.010
So let's come here and I'm going to say Slider, Dot and Eventless Center.

41
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.630
And in here I'm going to say mouse up.

42
00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.600
So when the mouse is up, you are going to run and an inventive mouse up.

43
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.420
And let's create a callback function here.

44
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.910
So now when the mouse is up, the is down is no longer true because it is not down, it is up, so is

45
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.840
down is false.

46
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.860
And we are going to say ups not in here and not going to grab our slider, what am I doing?

47
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.930
And we are going to say classless.

48
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.690
And from the class, we are going to remove the act of class because when the active classes added it

49
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.530
is grabbing.

50
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.220
When the active class is removed, it is not grabbing anymore.

51
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.600
So grabbing, not grabbing, grabbing, not grabbing C..

52
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.320
So this was the first functionality that I wanted to implement.

53
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.840
The second functionality is a bit like difficult to explain, but I'm going to try my best.

54
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:58.200
So whenever I click here we can see that we are indeed is down state and is down is true.

55
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.780
If I come outside this gallery, we can see that we have this not allowed.

56
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.170
Right.

57
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:14.860
And if I release the mouse there, we can see we return back to to to the cursor, to the cursor value

58
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.520
that we had.

59
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.210
And if I come down, we can see that now we are we are basically back to normal because is down is false.

60
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.330
Whenever we the mouse leaves the slider.

61
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.960
Right.

62
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.100
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the mouse leave event.

63
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.950
And I just commented it out in my other screen.

64
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.290
And you just saw The Flash, which I saved.

65
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.400
So now I'm going to click and I'm going to go up and I'm going to release it there.

66
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.750
It returns back.

67
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.420
But whenever I come back to this container, we can see that the mouse is still down.

68
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.840
So we need a mouse leave event as well.

69
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.310
I'm going to go one more time.

70
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.580
So let's let's zoom out.

71
00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.500
So when I click here inside this and I go up and I release it outside the container, of course, nothing

72
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.190
happens here.

73
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.530
But if I return back to the container, we can see that we are already in the in the active state.

74
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.700
What is the active state?

75
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.280
The active state is when the cursor is grabbing.

76
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.220
See, this is this is kind of like a bug.

77
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.210
We don't want to do this.

78
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.480
And now I'm going to go ahead and comment in the mouse mouse leaf and now I'm going to grab it, go

79
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.630
outside the container, leave it there, come back.

80
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.590
Nothing happens.

81
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.490
Right.

82
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.260
So I want to do this as well.

83
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.720
All right.

84
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.540
Slider and Eventless Center.

85
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.800
So when the mouse leaves what?

86
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.000
The container.

87
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.710
I want to run a function.

88
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.600
What is the function going to do?

89
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.340
The function is going to say that is down is no longer true.

90
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.140
It is false, not false.

91
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.590
False.

92
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.740
And the slider dart at a dart class list from there.

93
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.670
What I want to do, I want to remove when this event is fired, I want to remove the active clause.

94
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.300
Right.

95
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.350
So whenever we do this, I just showed you what happens.

96
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:20.890
And after this, what I want to do here in this video is I want to know exactly what I want to find

97
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.750
where the click is.

98
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.580
So now let's go ahead and let's see.

99
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.410
That's why we created this start.

100
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.370
So I'm going to go into this mouse down and I'm going to say.

101
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:41.270
Start X should be equal to idot page X, I'm just going to say page X and I'm going to save it.

102
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.850
Now we don't know what this idot page s, OK, we know e what what the E as we have talked about it

103
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.540
a lot.

104
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.010
But what about this page?

105
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.850
So before doing that, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to cancel log this to you.

106
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.360
So we have our event object now.

107
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.460
This event is going to be fired.

108
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.820
Whenever we click inside this container, so I'm going to zoom out a bit more.

109
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.680
So there is an extra space, so there is extra space for our I'm just going to go to this extent so

110
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.860
there is extra space for the console.

111
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.800
So if I click here, we can see the event has been created.

112
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.930
So the page X is going to give us the accordionists where the click has been happened.

113
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.140
So if I click here.

114
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:35.280
OK, so if I click here, let's go ahead and let's see the page X, we can see that the page has added

115
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.590
to because the distance from this offset top all the way to here is 82, OK?

116
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.690
And it is also going to give a sorry, sorry.

117
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.300
That is not the distance that is projects.

118
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.140
So distance from here to the edge of this container is 82 pixels.

119
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.900
This is going to be very much better visible if I just put it down.

120
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.270
So because we are working in this direction.

121
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.670
So let's go ahead and trash this.

122
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:09.240
So if I click here now, when I click here, it should be like zero one or like two or three.

123
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.900
Very small value because this is the start of the container.

124
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.410
OK, but when I come here into page X, we can see it's says 442.

125
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.580
And why is that?

126
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:27.720
Because it is for from this age of this, the screen all the way to the edge of this container is almost

127
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.790
440 pixels.

128
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.830
442 is where we clicked.

129
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:39.320
And if I click here, we can see that this value has been increasing.

130
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:46.030
The reason that I'm sure it is 1056, the reason that I'm showing you this is this is the offset value.

131
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.480
This is not the value that we want.

132
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.450
We want to know exactly where we clicked.

133
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:58.230
But when I click, for example, here, for example, if I click here, this should be like 20, 30

134
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.240
pixels, not more than that, but it's just 408 like eighty seven.

135
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.020
Right.

136
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.410
So we need to make sure that this value is accurate.

137
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:15.990
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove this console coming this back end and I'm going to I'm

138
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:22.290
going to subtract the offset left of the slider from this value.

139
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.850
All right.

140
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.330
So before subtracting that, let's go ahead and cancel it.

141
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.600
I'm going to subtract it, and that's going to be it for this video.

142
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.030
So we are going to say slider, dot, offset.

143
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:45.800
Aref said, left at Servet, and when I click, we can see it's 439, so if I click right here, we

144
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.710
can see it's still 400 because the distance from here all the way to here, it's four hundred and thirty

145
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.970
nine.

146
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.890
If I click, it is still a four hundred and thirty nine.

147
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:06.760
But if I zoom back in, zoom back in tower one hundred percent and bring this up and now let's try it.

148
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.700
And now if I click here it is 60 pixels.

149
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:18.200
So we need to subtract the value of the page from the 60 pixels to be able to get exactly where it is

150
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
that we have clicked.

151
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:26.470
So I'm going to grab the slider X and I'm going to a slider and I'm going to say minus this value.

152
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.040
And now let's go ahead and let's comment.

153
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.260
Let's consulates start X.

154
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.350
And so now if I click, we should be able to see very small value.

155
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.200
It is one.

156
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.300
So it is 369.

157
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.590
It is seven forty seven.

158
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.280
Remember that the width of this container is 400.

159
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.790
So whenever we get towards the end of the container we should get towards for fourteen hundred.

160
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.140
If I click it's is thirteen ninety six.

161
00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:02.240
So at this point we have successfully selected or mapped to where the user has clicked.

162
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:09.650
Of course this value is in the horizontal in the extraction because this gallery is horizontal gallery

163
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.280
scroller.

164
