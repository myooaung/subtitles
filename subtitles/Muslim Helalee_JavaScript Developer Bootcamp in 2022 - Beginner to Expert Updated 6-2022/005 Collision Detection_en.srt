00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,740
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to detect the collision.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,430
All right, so what it is actually that we are going to do in this lecture, what we're going to do

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:19,100
as first off, they're going to detect collision for the for the bottom and then.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,060
Right, because they're positive, they're simpler and then top and then left.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:23,920
Right.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,860
So if I come in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to detect the collision inside this run game

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,970
because this run game is the function that is being run or called 60 times per one second.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,410
So I'm going to call it collision.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,490
Detection, right?

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:53,370
So now first F, now F F the vertical, the no, consider what's in charge of moving this ball.

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,540
It's the vertical velocity now of the vertical velocity.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,850
First off, we are going to check it for the bottom.

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,930
So if the vertical velocity is greater than zero, what does it mean?

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,920
It means that the ball is moving towards the bottom right.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:15,980
And we are going to use logical end operator and the vertical position is greater than the canvas height.

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,400
All right, then, what do we want to do?

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,380
We want to reverse the velocity.

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,050
So when it hits this edge, canvases, that height is going to give us this edge, this bottom part

19
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,770
of the canvas.

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,280
When it hits that bottom part of the canvas, we just want to move it back, bounce it back.

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,410
So let's convert that code.

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,130
So bottom boundary, perfect.

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,080
So for the bottom boundary, the ball has to be moving towards the bottom.

24
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,030
So for that to be moving toward the bottom, the Y.

25
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,310
V should be greater than zero.

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,100
If it is less than zero, it means the velocity is negative.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,060
When the velocity is negative, which direction that is, does it move?

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,000
It moves to the top direction.

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,970
And so both of the expressions should be true for this.

30
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,660
If statement to run and the Y.

31
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:21,130
P has to be if it is greater than remember or equal to canvases, canvasses, height minus the radius.

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,840
We did this in our previous lecture.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,300
If this is the condition, what do we want to do?

34
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,450
If this is the condition, it means that the ball has touched the bottom of the canvas, what do we

35
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:37,950
want to do?

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,340
We want to reverse the direction of the velocity.

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,530
Very, very simple.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,380
So the wive is equal, is going to be equal to negative YV we just want to reverse it.

39
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,710
So let's say let's check it out if it actually works.

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,170
Boom.

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,740
There we go.

42
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:04,110
So you can see when it hits the bottom, it deflects back in that in any direction that it is, that

43
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,520
that is going to make sense.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,370
You don't have to worry about in which direction it goes.

45
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,420
Just reverse the direction and JavaScript engine is going to take care of it.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,110
Boom.

47
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,650
There we go.

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,160
So that's the bottom boundary, and next, I'm going to do the right boundary.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:28,680
So our Eigsti boundary, it's almost the same as what we did in our previous project, except that we

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,900
are checking if the ball is moving in that direction, if it is not moving in that direction, we don't

51
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,740
want to do anything.

52
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,030
That's why we are going to have four stand alone if statements.

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:48,810
So let's just provide some dots there, because these are the headlines or these are the things that

54
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,410
we're doing.

55
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,390
This if statement is a part of this collision detection, I don't want to miss anything up here.

56
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,280
So.

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,700
Right.

58
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,270
Boundry.

59
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,700
So f the same thing again.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,390
F the X velocity is greater than zero.

61
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,360
It means that the ball excuse me, the ball is moving to the right.

62
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:18,329
So when the ball is moving to the right and the horizontal position of the ball is greater than the

63
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:18,959
canvas.

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,410
Allen.

65
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:28,520
Alan, come on, canvas elements with minus the radius, then what do we want to do?

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,890
So in this case, the ball is moving to the right when it hits the canvas.

67
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,050
We want it to move.

68
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,290
We want to move it back.

69
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,920
So what do we want to do?

70
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,550
We just reverse the direction of the velocity.

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,560
X, v, so let's check it out.

72
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:55,420
So it should reflect back the country so it doesn't go off the side of the screen anymore, so boom,

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,830
see, it deflects back.

74
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,170
Check it out one more time.

75
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,680
Come on.

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,510
Give me, like, a straight one.

77
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,700
Yeah.

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,060
Come on, buddy.

79
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,060
Come on.

80
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,440
OK, better one better.

81
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,400
Oh, that was better.

82
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,250
We lost it.

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,340
I mean, this works as well, so when it hits it, it deflects back.

84
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,090
Bounces back.

85
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:29,180
So we are done with the bottom and the right, and now we are going to go to Tom Boundry, so we are

86
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,320
going to say F now for the top.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,880
First off, we need to check that the ball, the velocity is in the in that direction is headed in that

88
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,350
direction.

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,920
So we say if y if AYP is less than zero.

90
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:50,240
So when the velocity of that's the that's the position when the velocity is less than zero, it means

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,980
the velocity is negative, negative.

92
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,630
It's moving towards the top.

93
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:04,750
And the vertical position which is the Y p is less than or equal to radius.

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,110
We did this that in the previous lecture.

95
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,360
So what I'm going to do is we are going to grab the Y v and we are going to reverse its direction y

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,620
v and you know what?

97
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm going to I'm going to test it and then we're going to do this.

98
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,930
So so this to work.

99
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,090
There we go.

100
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,720
So it hits it and bounces back and it goes to the left.

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:36,110
So left boundary f first off, let's check if the ball is moving in that direction.

102
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,620
So if X V is less than zero, it means the ball is moving to the left.

103
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,150
What do we want to do?

104
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,970
We want to check if the ball is moving to the left.

105
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:56,360
And also or as well, we want to check if the position of the X is less than or equal to radius.

106
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,320
It means that the ball has gone off the canvas.

107
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,700
We don't want it to go off the canvas.

108
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:09,870
That's why we provide a condition and we say just grab our velocity and reverse the direction of the

109
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,530
velocity.

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,790
That's it.

111
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,580
Check it out.

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,240
Let's watch this.

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,160
So bounces off.

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,030
Bounces off.

115
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,870
Bounces off.

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,210
Bounce back, bounce back.

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
There we go, bounces back.

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,710
So I'm going to check this out.

119
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,240
You can see that we could go faster.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,980
I could go like two oh one, which is going to be really fast.

121
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,610
See, it's this is how it is going to look like, so this is just to test that all the boundaries,

122
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,140
they work perfectly fine.

123
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,320
I mean, we could do, like, not that crazy fast.

124
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,150
We could do like five oh one.

125
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,150
And.

126
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:57,130
All the boundaries, they work well and it and when it hits a collision part now, the collision has

127
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,750
been defined on these four edges when it hits any collision point.

128
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:10,100
Then it bounces in an angle that makes the most sense that you don't have to care about, that JavaScript

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,650
engine is going to do it for you, not JavaScript is going to understand, OK, in which which direction

130
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,090
should I bounce off?

131
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,230
So whenever it hits this and if the direction is like this, it is going to go this way.

132
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,610
So that's the sensible way of going it going about it.

133
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:25,850
Right.

134
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:33,169
So some of the physics that we have added to the canvas should be added by by US developers.

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,850
Some very, very minor parts have been added by JavaScript itself.

136
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,850
So we don't have to really worry about everything.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,830
You can see that we just reverse the direction and it does everything else on itself.

138
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,160
When it hits here, it should go in this direction.

139
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,430
But but it actually goes in a diagonal way, right?

140
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,070
Because that is the logical way of going.

141
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,750
So there we go, all the edges are perfectly bouncy.

142
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,690
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to check if it actually bounces off the edges, not anywhere.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
So I'm just going to say one and I'm going to say one.

144
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:22,690
And I'm going to say for both of them, I'm going to say zero point five, that's so it has it's going

145
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,660
to be very slow.

146
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,140
It's actually going to be really slow, so let's convert it to five.

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
So it.

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,950
Come on, buddy, it's not even moving one inch.

149
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,540
So I was going to return that.

150
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,340
I'm just going to give it like a 10 here.

151
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,570
And it's 10:00 here, so now it should be moving, but, oh, right, it's very slow.

152
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,270
50 maybe.

153
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,860
I just want to make sure that it truly bounces off the edge.

154
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,770
Oh, come on.

155
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,700
All right.

156
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,880
Boom bounces off the edge.

157
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,470
And it should be perfect.

158
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,520
It shouldn't be even one pixel off.

159
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,710
If it is one pixel off, then it means that the user experience is going to be not that good because

160
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,100
users are really good at games like we are good at games.

161
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:22,300
We are good at pointing out mistakes in other people's, I don't know, whatever, and that's not going

162
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,550
to be a good user experience.

163
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,470
So you can see that it bounces perfectly off the edges.

164
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,800
So with that, Don, I'm just going to convert it back to to a one.

165
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,470
I think it's proper speed.

166
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,160
And that's it for this lecture and for this project.

167
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,150
In the next project, we are going to create a fantastic effect and we are going to dive into more of

168
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,700
