00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.340
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.860
In this lecture, we are going to update the UI with the user input.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.580
All right, so we are inside the update UI function, we don't how we can capture the amount that the

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.370
user enters, but how do we displayed we have stored inside this income the outcome and the balance

5
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.150
variables.

6
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.300
But how do we show it on the on the UI?

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.530
So first off, let's go ahead and let's decide on the sign up for the for the balance.

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.120
So I'm going to use a turnaround operator and I'm going to say let's sign be equal to if income is greater

9
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.820
or equal to outcome.

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.740
So if income is equal to income or sorry if income is equal to outcome or if income is greater than

11
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.960
the outcome, we want a positive dollar sign there.

12
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:06.200
But in case the income is less than the outcome, we want the balance to have a negative side right

13
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.800
like that.

14
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.080
Now, let's go ahead and let's say up a day to get the UI right.

15
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.920
So what is this?

16
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.570
And updating the UI, all right, so for updating the UI, what we need to do is we need to grab the

17
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.950
balance element, which is the balanced value, the income total element in total and the outcome total

18
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.180
element, the expense.

19
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.670
Outcome, total aliment, expense total.

20
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.020
Uh, KYAY.

21
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.380
All right, I think this is not accurate.

22
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.880
In total, let's come inside the budget header so we have income total and we have no outcome total,

23
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.420
so let's change it to outcome total.

24
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.090
We are going to grab all three of them and we are going to update them using these very values that

25
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.660
we have here.

26
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.150
So first off, let's grab the balance element and we are going to say that our HTML should be equal.

27
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.120
Now, what do we want to create here?

28
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.820
We want to create a paragraph element.

29
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.850
This is the starting for the paragraph.

30
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.210
Now, as you know, we have two paragraphs in here.

31
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.930
The first paragraph is for the dollar sign.

32
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.590
So I'm just going to grab it.

33
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.080
And I am just going to put it right here now in the second paragraph actually holds the value and it

34
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.290
basically says zero.

35
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.090
So for the for the balance, we don't know which side the dollar is going to get.

36
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.050
Either the dollar is going to be positive or negative.

37
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.440
That's why we have created the sign variable and we are going to pass it inside a template strength.

38
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.330
Let's pass it right here.

39
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.570
So that's the sign.

40
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690
And this is going to be the value.

41
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.230
So we're the value.

42
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.600
Where does the value of balance come from?

43
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.890
It is going to come from from the come from the balance itself that we have created.

44
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.180
So I'm just going to pass in here balance.

45
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.540
So this is going to be the balance in arrestment.

46
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.530
Then we could grab the income total aliment that enter HTML.

47
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.060
Now keep in mind, we still have two paragraphs there, but with a minor change, the changes that we

48
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.590
do not want to specify the sign for that.

49
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.600
That's why I'm just going to pass in like a regular dollar sign, because the income total is positive

50
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.680
in all cases.

51
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.200
It is not going to have a negative sign, neither the outcome.

52
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.850
That's what the name suggests.

53
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.490
So if it is income, it means that it's positive.

54
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.480
If it is outcome, it means that it is negative.

55
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.220
So the name suggests the sign.

56
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.390
We don't need to provide it.

57
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.080
We just need to provide it for this balance.

58
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:11.940
And instead of the balance less pass and the income in finally outcome total element that enter a [REMOVED]

59
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:20.100
amount because we are creating we are creating a similar aliments.

60
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.660
We are going to use entrustment.

61
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:29.100
OK, so let's replace this with a normal dollar sign and we are going to say out, come, let's save

62
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.260
it, let's come here and fund some error.

63
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.110
I don't know.

64
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.340
Let's let's go ahead and let's say project and let's say 15.

65
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.570
Seventy five.

66
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.560
Let's click on it.

67
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.640
And now we can see that the this is fifteen seventy five.

68
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.060
The balance, the income says fifteen seventy five as well.

69
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.290
All right.

70
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.630
So maybe I should like zoom in a little bit.

71
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.510
So this is zoom 90 percent.

72
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.240
So the income says 15, 75.

73
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.580
The balance says 15, 75.

74
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.040
The inputs are cleared, but the list is empty.

75
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.410
So the next logical thing that we will do will be the list.

76
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.550
But before that, let's check out that this is this is working.

77
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.440
So we are going to say twelve seventy five.

78
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.670
And now we get 300, right?

79
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.220
So 17 a 15, 75 to 75.

80
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.670
We are going to get 300, let's say Dorna, maybe like a very expensive dinner of 500.

81
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.280
Now, whatever we say, 500, we are going to get to negative signs.

82
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.350
So this negative is going to come from our ternary operator.

83
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.730
But what about this one?

84
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.400
This we do not want.

85
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:53.800
So we are going to grab this balance and we are going to put it inside another cool method which is

86
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.810
related to the math object.

87
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.380
So we are going to grab math that ABSs.

88
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.680
So this is the absolute return is the absolute value of a number.

89
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.810
So the absolute value of any number is going to be that number without the sign.

90
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.240
So when any number doesn't have a sign, it means that it is a positive number.

91
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.330
It is like assumed like it's assumed like that in mathematics.

92
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.030
So it even gives you an example.

93
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.270
So this Intellisense of Vasco, it is like super awesome.

94
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.530
So it's just, for example, the absolute value of fun they get.

95
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.830
A VIFF is the same as the absolute value of five, meaning that the absolute value of negative five

96
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.810
is five and the absolute value of five is five.

97
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.080
So five equals five.

98
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.970
Right.

99
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.310
And now by doing this and saving, of course, everything goes away because we have not stored idiot.

100
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.930
So let's put the event to 100.

101
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.120
And unfortunately for the project, don't mind the mess spell.

102
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.400
Let's put it to 50.

103
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.660
Now we get negative.

104
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.530
Fifty dollars.

105
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.680
All right, so we get outcomes one hundred and fifty.

106
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.550
All right, so.

107
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:18.420
We have crew, we have updated the UI, and now what I want to do here is I want whenever I insert whenever

108
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:25.860
the user inserts something, not only I want to grab it inside the balance, income and outcome, but

109
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.630
also I want to print it to this list, to their specific list as well.

110
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.920
So this all is empty.

111
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.250
Expense tracker, income tracker.

112
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.740
They're all empty.

113
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.270
Right.

114
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.850
But before doing that, I want to create a function here and this function is going to be clear.

115
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.860
L.M. and.

116
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.630
Element.

117
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.670
OK, and I'm going to pass in an array as an argument and I'm going to say expense list.

118
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.150
So first off, let's go ahead.

119
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.690
And it's clear that before entering any new ones, we make what we want to make sure that we clear that

120
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.480
this is the first reason for this function.

121
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:11.980
The second reason is that whenever we get towards the end of this project and you add, for example,

122
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.260
any thing here, when you click on this, delete it should delete it.

123
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:23.800
And if you do not provide it with the clear element, it is going to delete it from this header, but

124
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.110
it is going to stay inside the dashboard.

125
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.070
All right.

126
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.679
So I can I can just give you like like a demo here.

127
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:39.190
So I have commented out the clear input and let's say SFD to all.

128
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.520
If I say it now, we can see everything is working properly.

129
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.810
But when I click on the trash icon, this is zero.

130
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.600
This is zero.

131
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.010
But this chart is gone.

132
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.660
But this is still here.

133
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.350
So we want to clear the lists whenever we are done with them.

134
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.050
Whenever we want to remove them, we are going to grab the whole list as well.

135
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.590
I'm going to come in this one back in and this is going to be it and the next lecture we are going to

136
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.720
create a show and tree function.

137
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:16.720
Now that show entry function is responsible for printing ANELLI here and the income tracker, another

138
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.430
one here and another one.

139
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.310
And you'll see you guys in the next one.
