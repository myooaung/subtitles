00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:02.490
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.780
In this next year, we're going to draw lines, arcs and circles randomly.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.980
All right, so here is the plan that we have and the example, number four is going to be randomizing

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.240
the line's location.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.520
So I'm going to say four and I'm going to say let I be equal to zero.

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.750
We are not equal to zero.

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.460
Are going to start from zero.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
And the AI is going to go all the way to 20, OK?

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.220
And each time we are going to increment I by one.

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.140
And.

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.210
All right.

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.630
So first things first.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
We need to grab the X the horizontal location.

14
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.390
We need to grab the vertical location because we have done that right in our previous part of this randomising.

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.690
And then because I want to randomize the size as well, I'm going to grab the line the finishing points

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.450
as well.

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.560
So we are going to get four variables.

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.720
So I'm going to say let X I'm going to call it X start and we are going to use our math, the random

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.740
method by now.

20
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.790
I think you're comfortable with this now because this is the horizontal starting position.

21
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380
We need to get the width of the winter.

22
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.790
So window, window, dot, inner width.

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.400
I didn't go over this amount because it's basically the same thing except for this name and this name.

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
So I didn't go over that and canvas takes up the entire height.

25
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.040
And with we've gone over this, I don't want to go over that because we need we have a lot of things

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.610
to cover.

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.940
So why start is going to be math dot random.

28
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.660
Now we multiply it again by the window dot enter height.

29
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.630
In right now, this is the starting positions for X and Y, right?

30
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.970
So let's come to this one now.

31
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860
What is going to be the ending position?

32
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.870
So I'm going to say let X and math dot.

33
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.840
Math that random and are basically going to do the same thing.

34
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.920
So I'm just going to copy this so it is going to end them randomly.

35
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.400
Right.

36
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.430
And then we have let Y end the same thing.

37
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.310
Right.

38
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.040
So by chance, they might be the same.

39
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.890
But there is a very, very small chance of these random numbers to be the same thing.

40
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.010
So this is why and I'm just going to change it to Etai.

41
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.710
All right.

42
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.630
So now let's create our line.

43
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.190
So first off, we are going to grab our canvas context and say begin path.

44
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.760
And then we want to grab the move to function and line to functions.

45
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.270
So canvas move to.

46
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.680
So these are going to be the starting positions.

47
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.060
So X start and Y start.

48
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.150
And then we have canvas contact, stud line to.

49
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.140
What is that line, too, and then these are going to be the ending positions, so X and.

50
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.020
X and and Y.

51
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.540
And and after that, I'm going to provide the color, you can randomize the color as well, but because

52
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.820
this is just like a simple line, I'm not going to go through the trouble of doing that.

53
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.240
So a canvas context, stroke style.

54
00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:03.920
And let's set it to white and finally, let's draw them so canvas context, dot stroke, let's save

55
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.060
it, let's come here.

56
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.920
And that's the previous lecture.

57
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.290
Let's open it up with live server and we don't see anything.

58
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.480
And why do you think is that so now let's go over let's first of let's see if there is there are any

59
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:32.780
errors and window misspelt when this one is misspelled and this is misspelled because it was a copy

60
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.830
paste operation.

61
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.690
So let's save it.

62
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.030
Let's come here x and is not defined.

63
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.000
Why are you doing this?

64
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.290
So now everything should work perfectly fine.

65
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.470
And now you can see we get all this cluster of lines, so reload the page each time we get different

66
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.890
lines.

67
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.280
Now these lines, they have a different starting point.

68
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.220
You can see they have a different ending point.

69
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.460
They have a different size and also.

70
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.700
And that's it.

71
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.720
So we have just randomize the lines.

72
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.730
I know there is actually nothing practical about this, almost nothing practical.

73
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.520
But this idea is helpful when we get to our circles.

74
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.630
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going I'm going to just comment this entire thing out, because

75
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.610
this is going to be very, very crowded when we get to where arcs and circles.

76
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.040
So in here, we are going to say for for let's I be equal to zero and then we are going to increment

77
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.090
the I we're going to we are going to say the I should go to twenty and then increment I by one.

78
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.670
Now we want to randomize the arcs location.

79
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.010
Right.

80
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.580
So for the arcs we know that we have an X start and Y start.

81
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.500
A Y start.

82
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:58.490
So X start should be math that random which is going to give us a random number.

83
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.440
No multiplied by window dot inner with.

84
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.340
In a year with now, the Y is going to be the same.

85
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.890
So I'm just going to copy it from there, put it right here uncommented.

86
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.690
All right.

87
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.580
So now we have our starting position for the ARC, which is a start.

88
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.260
And why start now?

89
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.950
We need a random radius as well.

90
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.740
So in case you want to randomize the size, then you need to randomize the radius as well.

91
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.860
So I'm going to say a radius and I'm going to use math dot random.

92
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.130
And that's multiplied by window.

93
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:50.310
Dart inner with, right, and because this is going to give me a large number, what I'm going to do

94
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.190
is I'm going to divide it by a tenth of this.

95
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.990
So it's going to give me a tenth of this random number and it's going to divide it by 10.

96
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.210
JavaScript is really good with this kind of mathematics, mathematical operations.

97
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:11.980
So canvas context, we are going to say begin path and now canvas context, that arc the biggest method.

98
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.310
So for the X horizontal position, we say X start for the wife, for the vertical position, we say

99
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.650
Y start for the radius.

100
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.430
I'm just going to say radius starting angle is going to be zero.

101
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.780
Now what is the ending angle?

102
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.950
The ending angle is going to be just fine because we want to draw an arc.

103
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.210
We don't want to draw a circle.

104
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.160
So we are not going to multiply it by two.

105
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.500
And finally, can this context start stroke?

106
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.880
Save it now, you can see we get all this.

107
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:54.090
It's blocked because we didn't define the stroke style, so I'm going to come down here, can this context,

108
00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:01.470
stroke style change changed to train so that now we get green?

109
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:07.510
Now you can see that they have a different starting position, a different coordinates for each of the

110
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.890
arcs.

111
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.010
They have also different sizes.

112
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.490
Right.

113
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.410
So this is how you randomize arcs.

114
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.660
Now, how would we randomize circles?

115
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.540
It's almost the same thing.

116
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.540
And I'm just going to copy that and I'm going to paste it here.

117
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.280
I'm going to come in this one out.

118
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.000
And the only thing that I'm going to change here is just multiplied by two.

119
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.200
And there we go, we get circles, all right.

120
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:42.110
So with this, our lecture comes to an end and we have been able to randomize our lines and arcs and

121
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.270
finally circles.

122
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.200
See you guys in the next one.
