00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,750
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,910
In this lecture, we're going to reset the ball to start from the center.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,160
All right.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:19,570
So what I'm going to do is if if our ball goes off the R.I side, it means that the A.I. has scored

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,310
and the score should increase by one.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:29,800
If the ball goes off the ice side, it means that the RBA has scored and this zero should should should

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
be incremented by one.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,010
We just want incremented by one.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,920
We also want to add the audio as well.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:43,090
And also whenever any of the players they score the ball should be reset, it means it should start

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,940
from the center.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,730
So let's do that.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,010
And I'm going to say updating the scores.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,700
First off, let's update the scores.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,280
And for that, we need we need if statements.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:02,410
Of course, if the ball ball's exposition is less than zero, it means that it has gone off the left

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,390
side of the screen.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,170
What is the left side of the screen assigned to its assigned to the arrow.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,650
But we need to account for the radius as well.

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,280
So I'm just going to say Baldor radius, we need to account for the radius as well.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,200
If it goes the left side of the screen, it means that the A.I. has scored.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:31,000
See, so the AI scores are scored and we need to grab the paddle player and sorry, the player paddle

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,850
player paddle away.

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,530
And from there we are going to grab the score and we are going to incremented by one and we are going

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,270
to grab the ice core idea and we are going to play it as well.

26
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,540
And when the ice cores, we want to reset the ball to start from the center.

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,980
Now, what is the elusive.

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:02,550
al-Assaf now al-assaf the ball dot, the exposition of the ball is greater than the canvases with canvas

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,800
element with it means that the ball has gone off the right side of the screen.

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,920
If it goes off the right side of the screen, the right side of the screen is associated with the player

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,490
ehi.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,200
It means that the player r.i has scored so the player.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,030
I couldn't catch it.

34
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,530
So it was score.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,610
Right and we need to accommodate for the radius as well.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,800
So I'm just going to say Baudot radius.

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,240
All right, and what do we want to do that when the our eyes cause we we can say that they are I scored

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,840
when it goes off the left side, the way I scored the right side, I scored very simple logic.

39
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,050
So we are going to say player Padel, our idot score just incremented by one.

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:02,280
We are going to play the r.i score ordeal and we are going to call in our reset ball function now to

41
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,350
be able to create the reset ball function.

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:11,520
What I'm going to do as I'm going to come on top of everything manager and I'm going to say the reset

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,650
ball function function perfect.

44
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:25,080
So function reset ball, there are going to be any parameters basically we just want to reset the ball.

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,260
What are what is it that we want to reset the ball.

46
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,820
The first thing that we want to reset the ball, ask the ball is X and Y position.

47
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:43,080
So ball dot exposition should be canvas elements with divided by two.

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,820
That's exactly what we did before.

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,150
Right.

50
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,820
So what about the Y position?

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,210
The Y position should be the canvas where Kanavis elements high divided by two.

52
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,660
Also, I'm going to reset the speed so the speed is going to be reset.

53
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,440
So originally I'm going to just collapse this.

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,060
Uh huh.

55
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,269
OK, so it's the run game, so originally we can see that the ball has a speed of 10.

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,050
So whenever we reset it, we should reset it to that speed of ten, because when the players they're

57
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,430
playing, the speed increases.

58
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:31,710
And when one score is the speed, the speed, the speed, the speed should start again at that's that

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,130
point.

60
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,960
And I'm going to save that.

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,130
And let's come here.

62
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,360
Let's check this one out.

63
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,810
So I'm going to increase the audio.

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,540
So we do.

65
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:48,090
There we go, it bounces back, I'm going to play for like a couple of minutes, so either so there

66
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,720
we go, it's scored and now we can see that when it when when the when computer scores, the ball is

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,650
coming towards me and let me score.

68
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,540
So let's see where the ball is going to go.

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,890
OK.

70
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,130
You can see that the ball is getting speed.

71
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,770
OK, and the audio is working perfectly fine.

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,580
Oh, boy.

73
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,470
There we go.

74
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,500
That was a mistake I wanted to do like a hard angle, but it didn't work, so I'm not going to do anything

75
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,990
fancy again.

76
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,560
So let's see.

77
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,080
Boom, there we go.

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,900
Well, the only way that I can beat the computer is just to wait until this the speed of the ball increases,

79
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,570
there is no other way of beating it.

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,340
It doesn't matter how.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,680
What is the angle that you hit it with?

82
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,030
It's always going to get there.

83
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,130
That was a straight line, by the way.

84
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,580
There we go when tensions at the top, it's going to go at an angle of 45 degrees, it should come right

85
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,930
there.

86
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,160
OK, come on.

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,590
I know the speed is slow, you could go faster, but and now the speed is getting faster.

88
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,650
I'm going to give it like try to give it a hard angle.

89
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,950
Come on.

90
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,000
Not that good.

91
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,740
Maybe like 30 degrees.

92
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,130
That was 30 degrees.

93
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,590
Let's do more.

94
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,040
Ah, right.

95
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,480
Oh, come on, man.

96
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:58,120
So anyway, what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here, I'm going to set the speed.

97
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:08,320
The speed, let's set it to 15 and I'm going to reset the speed whenever it happens, I'm going to set

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,950
it to 15.

99
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,210
So if I save it whenever one hits it, it's going to go 50.

100
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,860
So you can see how fast it is.

101
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,480
OK.

102
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,970
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

103
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,130
Let me score one.

104
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,640
There we go.

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,400
So either of the players who score it is going to go to the next player.

106
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,110
It's just going to the computer.

107
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:39,200
So whichever player scores, the other player gets to start with the next one.

108
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:45,320
And you can see that now the A.I. is not strong and is not powerful enough to get the ball.

109
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,350
It is just moving in that direction.

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,310
See, the AA is not powerful enough.

111
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:03,210
See, there is not it cannot even get to there, but let's say for the sake of fun, I'm just going

112
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,620
to increase the ICE intelligence level.

113
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Intelligence, I'm going to put it to zero point four, let's save it, let's see.

114
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,030
Now, let's check check this out.

115
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,020
S..

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,360
The area is getting it, it's trying to get it at the middle of the ball, so it was going to get it

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,930
at the middle.

118
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:38,500
So it's adjusting its metal there we go to for the eye and I'm going to increase the intelligence level.

119
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:47,280
You cannot score now, I mean, you should be, like, really expert to score against this, I, I could

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:55,650
increase it to point seven and now and I'm going to increase the speed to thirty.

121
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm sure I cannot keep up, but just for fun.

122
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,880
So I'm going to increase this to 30.

123
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,020
Let's save it.

124
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,890
Oh, boy, oh, boy, see, the eye keeps keeps going.

125
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,170
Yeah, there we go.

126
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I cannot even follow it with my eyes.

127
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,940
All right, there we go.

128
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,680
There we see the eyes getting it, you cannot score now.

129
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,920
That's why we need to dumb it down.

130
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,160
So I'm going to set this speed to seven.

131
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,590
The reset speed is going to be seven as well.

132
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,770
And the intelligence level better be one, only a 10 percent capacity.

133
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,660
If you set it to even like above four or five, you will never be able to beat the eye.

134
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,220
So with this, our logic comes to an end.

135
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,430
And I think we are done here.

136
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,960
And this was fun.

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,880
I know it was a longer project than usual, but creating is was creating.

138
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,260
It was a lot of fun.

139
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,030
Even more fun was teaching it.

140
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,650
And I hope you learned a lot.

141
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:09,430
And at the end, I just want to grab this and I want to I'm just going to decrease the volume.

142
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,110
I'm going to put it right here in case you want to learn more about it.

143
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,450
It's going to sound cosine and all of that.

144
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,290
So go ahead and play with this.

145
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:27,150
Play with the code, play with different levels, different speeds, different paddle with and height.

146
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:35,170
So you really, really get the idea of how this game is created and see you guys in the next one.
