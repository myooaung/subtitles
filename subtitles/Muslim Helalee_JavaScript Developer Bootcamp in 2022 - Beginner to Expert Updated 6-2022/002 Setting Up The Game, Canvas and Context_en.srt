00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,430
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will set up our game canvas and the canvas context.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:17,300
A ride, so in the stadium, if we go over this team, we just we have linked our script in the CSIS.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,690
We have a reset, basic stalling for the body just for that background color and overflow of hidden

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,050
also with just the center of our canvas element.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,760
So now let's go ahead.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,110
And we are starting from a very from an empty file.

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,970
So we will be typing everything.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,480
OK, so first thing, I want to create our game parameters.

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,120
So parameters.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,880
So first off, let's go ahead and specify a height for our game, which I'm going to put it to 750,

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,510
then let's go ahead and let's create the grid size.

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,390
The grid size is going to be 10.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,520
Then I'm going to create a constant 40 frames per second.

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,240
Now, we are used to using.

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,320
The request animation, from the reason that I'm putting this AFPs here is not that I'm going to use

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,400
this set interval, it is because of that delay that you see after either the game is is one or the

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,060
game is you're going to see a delay and then a new game is going to start.

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,050
This is just for that.

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,370
It's not for a requesting animation.

20
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,880
French.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,220
So we are going to have a delay and that is going to be delay end and it is going to be two seconds.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,830
So it's going to be seconds until a new game starts.

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,850
After that, we are going to have some derived dimensions.

24
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,380
Derived dimensions are the kind of dimensions that are based on something else.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:04,040
So first off, let's go ahead on this half hour with so the width is going to be high times zero point

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:15,140
nine, then we are going to have the cell size, which is going to be the width divided by grid size

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,410
plus two.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,130
This is the size of the cell plus the left and right margin.

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,780
Right.

30
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,290
Next up, we are going to create the stroke.

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,760
Right.

32
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,220
The stroke is going to be the cell size divided by 12.

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,950
All right, and.

34
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,390
Let's create the constant for the dots as well, so constant dot, it is going to be equal to the size

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,370
of the stroke that we have and we are going to create our margin as well.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:02,240
So consed margin now this margin is going to be the top margin so we can create that score the names

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,880
on whenever the game ends, like the game over text as well.

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:15,280
So it is going to be the height, minus the great size, plus one times the size of cell.

39
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,700
Perfect.

40
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,290
Now I'm going to create some colors as well, so let's say.

41
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,490
Colors.

42
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:33,270
We are going to have Consed, first off, the color of the board, I'm going to call it color board

43
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:43,770
and it is going to be hash zero f three zero five seven.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,080
And I'm going to copy this a bunch of times because we are going to have a color for border.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,220
So color border and the color for the border is simple.

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,620
It is going to be yellow, then we are going to have a color for the dot.

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,270
And the color for the date is going to be white.

48
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,850
Then we have our color eye or color player one, and that is going to be orange.

49
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,150
And this is going to be color a high, I'm just going to put it I.

50
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:23,130
Then we are going to have a color for the ehi light and the light color is that color.

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,600
Whenever you hover over it, you can see you're going to get the light.

52
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,860
And when you click, you're going to get the like the dark, darker version of it.

53
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,200
And that is going to be a najiba.

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:45,720
So RGV and 255 166 zero zero point three of Alpha Channel, then we are going to have the same kind

55
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,350
of format.

56
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,680
So I'm just going to get rid of this, the same format for the player.

57
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,280
So first off, we are going to have let me just grab that.

58
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,070
We are going to have player player color and then the color player light.

59
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,690
So it is going to be Lorne Green and the lighter version is going to be a lighter version of it.

60
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,310
Basically has some alpha channel.

61
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,810
I haven't done anything else to it.

62
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,980
So it is going to be one and six to fifty, two to fifty to zero and zero point three.

63
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,280
And finally we are going to have a color for tie whenever it is a tie.

64
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,470
So and that color is going to be white.

65
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,090
And that is going to be whenever you see that on the screen, it says draw, it is going to be that

66
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,550
color.

67
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,050
So let's go ahead and let's actually create our canvas.

68
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,710
So canvas, this letter is basically dedicated to setting up our game, first off.

69
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,950
And this canvas is going to be created dynamically.

70
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:58,340
Meaning that we are not going to create it in the e-mail, we will be creating it in the japes and we

71
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,880
will be refreshing the page and each time the page refreshes, we will be creating this canvas all over

72
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,220
again.

73
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,760
That's actually the ideology behind it.

74
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:14,510
So canvas element is going to be a document to create element.

75
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,010
What is the name of the element that is canvas?

76
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,150
We need a height for the canvas.

77
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,060
So we are going to say canvas element does height and it is going to be the height that we have specified

78
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,440
above.

79
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,890
We will be needing a width for the canvas.

80
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,590
So canvas element with and it is going to be the width that we have created up above.

81
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,670
Let's go ahead and let's provide the canvas with a parent.

82
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,490
So we are going to say append child.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,910
And let's pass on the name of the element, the name of the variable for that element, which is canvas

84
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,800
element, and I'm going to initialize a canvas rectangle, a context as well.

85
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,060
And that is going to give me all the like dimensions, the coordinates for the canvas, the top left,

86
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,130
the whenever I hover on the canvas, I need to get the exact points.

87
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:19,050
And that is a familiar method and that is get bounding clent rect, which is going to give us all the

88
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,590
coordinates that we require.

89
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,500
So we are done with the canvas.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:30,630
And I'm going to grab let's go ahead and let's grab the context and I'm going to call it Conex canvas

91
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,090
element to get context.

92
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,560
The context that we will be getting is 2D.

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,830
We are drawing this game in 2D, we are creating it in 2D.

94
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,810
So it should be 2D.

95
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,380
The line with is going to be.

96
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:53,230
Stroke we'll be using this line with I'm just going to create it right here, and then we are going

97
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:59,530
to have a text, a line for whenever any of the players they score or they create a box, they're going

98
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,770
to have like that alignment of the text within the box that these alignments, they belong to those.

99
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,450
So text align.

100
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,850
It is going to be center and Conex start a text baseline.

101
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,170
It's going to be metal.

102
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,370
Perfect.

103
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:25,240
So right after that, what do we have to do next is I'm going to go over the game, the loop itself.

104
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:35,169
So the way that in our previous game we had the comment pattern that we had in our previous game, I'm

105
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,549
going to do the same thing here.

106
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,730
So I'm going to I will be creating a longer, like Dasht comment and then the name of the whatever it

107
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,780
is that we are creating.

108
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,330
So it is going to be the game loop and I'm going to maybe like just make it a bit stand out.

109
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,590
I'm going to add stars there.

110
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,150
So I'm going to create a function and I'm going to call it a play game exactly like what we had in our

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,960
previous game.

112
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:04,150
The play game is going to request the animation from the requested animation frame is going to play

113
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:13,030
this function 60 times per one second because the screen refresh rate of my computer is sixty hertz.

114
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,730
It is either 30 or 60.

115
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,430
But there are I believe there are some mobile phones.

116
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,280
Who is refresh rate is 120.

117
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,900
So imagine how smooth something would run on a smartphone.

118
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:32,980
Would that would that sort of refresh rate we are going to pass in our game loop as a as an argument

119
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,300
here.

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,940
So we have created our game loop here.

121
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,420
The next thing that I would like to do, as I would like to go ahead and actually draw our board so

122
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,160
we can see something on the screen.

123
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,260
So first off, I want to come down here and I'm going to call a function draw board.

124
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,850
Perfect.

125
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,460
And let's go ahead and let's actually draw that.

126
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,280
So let's grab this comment.

127
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,390
Should save this so everything is fine.

128
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,910
Let's actually open this up with Life Server.

129
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,630
All right, so this is our game, this is what we will be building.

130
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm going to open up the console in case there are any errors.

131
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,470
So we have to fix them.

132
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,120
All right, so let's come down, let's grab this comment.

133
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:32,010
And let's put it down here, and I'm going to change it to the draw board function, perfect.

134
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,180
So now let's go ahead on this, actually draw our board.

135
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,280
So let's think what it is that we will be needing for the board.

136
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:47,590
So we will be needing a color, of course, then some coordinates and then actually we have to draw

137
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,130
the right.

138
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,350
So first off, let's actually give it the color.

139
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,040
So function draw board.

140
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:04,320
And we're going to say, let's grab our context and Phil style, the style is going to be the color

141
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,740
of the board that we have created right there.

142
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,720
And I'm going to get I'm going to create the border around that border as well.

143
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,030
So Conex that stroke's style, because that is going to be a line, right?

144
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,470
So stroke's style and it is going to be color border.

145
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,070
Let's create our border first.

146
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,990
So fell rect.

147
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,940
The exposition is going to be zero, the position is going to be zero, the width is going to be the

148
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,840
width of the canvas, the height is going to be the height of the canvas.

149
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,900
Perfect.

150
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,040
So now let's create the that border.

151
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,900
So we are going to say stroke.

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,270
The exposition is going to be stroke divided by two, Sarid divided by four.

153
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,290
The Y position is going to be stroke.

154
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,190
Also stroke divided by four.

155
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:12,970
The width is going to be the width of the canvas, minus stroke two times point five or divided by two,

156
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,950
and the height is going to be basically the same.

157
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,560
So I'm just going to copy this part.

158
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:29,840
So it's going to be hard right now whenever we increase and decrease the the width of the screen, the

159
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,240
width and the board are going to get increased and decreased at the same time.

160
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,390
So let's say that let's come here and let's come here.

161
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,310
So this is where we are actually drawing our board.

162
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,680
So.

163
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,490
I think let's go ahead and it's actually called the play game function down here, so I'm going to say

164
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,620
play a game and let's save it.

165
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,190
Let's come here.

166
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,680
There we go.

167
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,420
So this is the board that we have, so it is going to be directly in the middle because of that display

168
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,130
flex property that we have at it.

169
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,020
So I could keep it here and open the keep open the console right there.

170
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,780
This is going to be our final game.

171
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,230
I'm going to reset that as well.

172
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,650
So there we go.

173
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,230
Our board is drawn.

174
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,140
The next step that I would like to do in this lecture, because there are still 13 minutes.

175
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,120
I mean, we have 20 minutes.

176
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:29,210
So the next thing that I would like to do is I want to draw the grid as well in this lecture.

177
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,030
So let's go ahead and let's do that.

178
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,310
I mean, why not?

179
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,490
So I'm going to call a draw grid, right?

180
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,950
And we are going to call that function inside our game loop.

181
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
So let's say draw a grid.

182
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,230
Perfect, so they draw a grid function.

183
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,810
What do you think it is going to do?

184
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:58,370
The draw grid function is going to give us a number of columns, column dots to be accurate, and the

185
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,590
number of red dots, but.

186
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:09,780
It is actually going to be a bit different because now let's see, so we have 10 columns, so one,

187
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,150
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

188
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,970
Let's count the column.

189
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,100
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 and 11.

190
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,750
Right.

191
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,390
Why do we have 11?

192
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,540
Because in order for four for this box truck to work, we need an extra column of dots.

193
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,310
And in order for the row boxes to work, we need an extra row of dots.

194
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,600
So we will be adding one to our loop.

195
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,020
So let's go ahead and let's actually create the function draw.

196
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,800
Great.

197
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,940
All right.

198
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:53,920
And we are going to say for let I equals zero, we are going to loop over that.

199
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:02,290
I is going to go all that all all the way to great size plus one, OK, because of that extra rawhi

200
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,860
or extra column of dots or dots that we will be having, then we are going to increment I by one.

201
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,760
Now this is going to be for the for the why.

202
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,280
All right.

203
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,650
Now let's do it for the other direction as well.

204
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,080
So we are going to sell for let Jay.

205
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,730
So keep in mind that we have rows and columns, so we need to iterate over both of them.

206
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,810
Jay is going to start from zero, then Jay is going to go all the way to criticize plus one.

207
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,540
And we are going to increment by one each time.

208
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,250
All right, and in here, I'm actually going to call another function or another method and that is

209
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,870
going to be draw dot.

210
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:45,860
All right.

211
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,310
Within the draw dot function, we will be calling to other functions for the first one is going to be

212
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,740
get grid X and I'm going to pass in J.

213
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,850
And then we are going to say get grid Y and I'm going to pass.

214
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,120
And I so let's go ahead and let's actually create these other helper functions as well.

215
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:13,050
So the first function that I would like to create is going to be the draw dot function.

216
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,780
All right.

217
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:24,030
So within the DOT function, I'm just going to put that in there and I'm going to call this dot function,

218
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,770
draw dot within here.

219
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,790
We just want to draw a simple dot.

220
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,480
Now we need to pass an X and Y, all right.

221
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
Because they are Pastan as arguments.

222
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,630
So first off, let's go ahead and add the AFL style for a red dot.

223
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,490
So it is going to be filled style, the color of the dot that we have specified above.

224
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,880
Let's start the path.

225
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,980
So we are going to begin path and DOT is going to be a circle.

226
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,470
So we need the ARC method and we are going to pass an X and Y as the positions.

227
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,480
The radius is going to be the dot that we have specified above.

228
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:13,400
Starting angle is going to be zero ending angles going to mean math dot pi times two and we are going

229
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,990
to say fell flat dot perfect.

230
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,800
So we have created the dot function.

231
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:28,880
Next up, I would like to go ahead and create the Grid X and grid Y functions because they are pretty

232
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,830
easy as well.

233
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,160
So I'm going to come I'm going to bring this down a little and in here.

234
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,740
I'm going to grab this.

235
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,850
It's just I'm going to put it right here and I'm going to say get grid, get grid X.

236
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,420
First off, let's create that a function, get grid X.

237
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,250
We are going to pass and call him for that.

238
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,180
Right.

239
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:02,540
And we are going to say that this function is going to return return the cell size times, the column

240
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,330
that we have, plus one perfect.

241
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,880
So that this is going to be the grid X and I'm just going to copy this down below.

242
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,700
Just copy it down below and I'm going to say.

243
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,360
OK, so we are going to say that this is going to be the great wavefunction, get Broadway and we're

244
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,910
going to pass and row and this function is basically going to return.

245
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,410
There is an extra you there.

246
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,680
So this is going to return the margin margin.

247
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,200
Plus, sell.

248
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:47,800
Times the road that we have, so instead of calling plus one, we're just going to pass and row, let's

249
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,400
save that.

250
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,530
So we have our get grid X, we have our get grid Y and.

251
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,330
All right, so we have all these functions right here.

252
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,020
The grid is not drawn yet.

253
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:13,160
Because we have still some way to go to be able to see our grid, so I'm going to create our square

254
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,300
class first.

255
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,550
So I'm going to say the school where class.

256
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,370
But before actually creating the square class, now that I'm thinking about it, they should be able

257
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,710
to see a regret and we still don't we don't have any errors.

258
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,850
So we have set up the size of the grid, the color of the size of the doors, the color of the dot.

259
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,760
Why is there a no sign?

260
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,580
So let's remove that and save it.

261
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,760
There we go.

262
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,860
So this is our grade.

263
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,240
You can increase or decrease the size of the grid.

264
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,140
You can set it to five and you're going to see a grid, a five squares.

265
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,730
All right.

266
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,280
And you can set it to 15.

267
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,150
I guess you're going to see that a lot of them.

268
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,530
So the bigger the grid, the higher the number of squares that you have to fill.

269
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,140
Right.

270
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,670
So for a grid, a 10 by 10, you're going to have 100 squares for a grid, a five by five, you're going

271
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,560
to have like 25, I think.

272
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah.

273
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,470
So now let's go ahead.

274
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,780
And it's actually create the square constructor, the square class on the constructor.

275
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,800
And I'm going to say, hmm, I'm going to say class.

276
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,150
You know what?

277
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,040
It has been 20 minutes or so and that is a different topic.

278
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,270
So why shouldn't we cover cover that in our next lecture?

279
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,670
See you guys then.
