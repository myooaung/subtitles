Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.430
In this election, we are going to talk about the new key word.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.840
All right, so the new key word is the third way of invoking a function.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.480
OK, a common misconception among developers is that the new key word actually is used for invoking

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.450
is used for invoking class constructors.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.710
But it doesn't have anything to do with classes.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.020
Right.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.780
It is an unfortunate syntactic trick, a.k.a. syntactic sugar, OK, to make it look like it's dealing

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.910
with classes, but in reality it doesn't.

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.310
The new keyword actually does for very, very specific thing when we instantiate it.

11
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.850
So when the new keyword is used, the first thing that it does is it creates a brand new object, OK?

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.940
And it links that brand new.

13
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.610
The second thing is it links that brand new object.

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.390
All right.

15
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
To the two links to another object.

16
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.450
The third way is that it is going to invoke that function and also it is going to use a whole new object

17
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030
to invoke that function.

18
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.700
All right.

19
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.110
We're going to take a look at that and the fourth and final way final think that the new keyword is

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.680
going to do.

21
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.570
Is that the new keyword after the function call is done?

22
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.080
If that function doesn't return its own object, the new keyword assumes that human to return the this

23
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.550
keyword.

24
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.350
Right.

25
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.240
So if I were to save this, because this new keyword is going to return a brand new object.

26
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
And that brand new object, it is new, it doesn't have any movie property on it.

27
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.110
So for the Disturbed movie, we should get an undefined and if I save it, we get an undefined for that.

28
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.690
How do we know that it returns a brand new object in the context of calling that function?

29
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.650
I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to say cancel that log and I'm going to put it right here

30
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.320
and I'm going to comment that why not?

31
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.870
And when I save it, we can see that this is our movie function.

32
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.790
So this movie function has been called in the context of a brand new object that doesn't have anything

33
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.190
on it, that does not have anything on it.

34
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.580
All right.

35
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.520
We could go ahead, you know what, I'm just going to say that as well, I'm not going to comment that

36
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.960
one out.

37
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.440
We can go ahead and take we can go ahead and add properties and methods to this new empty object.

38
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.250
So I'm going to grab the numpty object and I'm going to say that name and I'm going to call it the new

39
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.570
empty obesity.

40
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:59.200
Save it, and now let's call that council loga to the council new empty object, and if I say it now,

41
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.440
we can see we have a the new empty object.

42
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.580
It doesn't matter how many properties you create in here.

43
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.480
Even if I say this the name, it is still not going to point to this name because the function call

44
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.670
happens first and then the brand new object is created and then the another property is added to the.

45
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.440
So no matter which way you go round it, you're not going to get this done movie.

46
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.550
So if I were to change this just name, we are still going to get an undefined in here because the function

47
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.700
call happens first and when the function call happens, then the new keyword is going to go ahead and

48
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.510
do all these four things.

49
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.690
So this is the new keyword and this is how it is going to provide us with a syntactic I'm not going

50
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.470
to call it trick anymore because that is a harsh word.

51
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.470
I'm just going to call a syntactic sugar for creating constructors, which you are going to take a look

52
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.570
at in our next or in our upcoming lecture.

53
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.940
See you guys then.
