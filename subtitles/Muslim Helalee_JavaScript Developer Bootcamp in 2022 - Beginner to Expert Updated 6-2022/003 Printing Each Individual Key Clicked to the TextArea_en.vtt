00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.290
In this lecture, we're going to bring to the screen the access key.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.930
All right, so in the last lecture, we have successfully accessed the key, but what what what I want

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.000
to do is whenever we click on the we get an uppercase A right.

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.860
And the reason for that is in here in the values, everything is uppercase.

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.700
Right.

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:33.590
But if you want to make sure that all the inputs on the screen there are lowercase, the default, final

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.460
thing that you can do here is just add a string method, which is to lower.

9
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.070
Case, that's it.

10
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.790
So if I click on this, we are going to go.

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:54.070
We are going to get a small letter, a small case, a so now let's go ahead and let's apply the program

12
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.730
logic.

13
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.070
Whenever we click on anything besides these keys, we want to apply some logic to control the flow of

14
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.770
this program.

15
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.850
That's why we have studied investments.

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.060
So if I go ahead and if I click here, we can see that Canaveri, property of two, lower case of undefined,

17
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.570
because in the previous lecture we saw how whenever you're not clicking on the keys, you're going to

18
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.220
get undefined and undefined, which is a data type.

19
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.640
Doesn't have to lower case method, OK?

20
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.390
It doesn't have to lower case method because it's undefined.

21
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.110
It can say cannot read property on to lower case of undefined at this point.

22
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.570
Right at this point.

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.430
So to be able to prevent this, to prevent this error from ever happening, we should provide some sort

24
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.110
of program logic control.

25
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.930
So we are going to say, if so, before writing this statement, I'm going to tell you what is it that

26
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.560
we want to do?

27
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.530
So we are going to say if the thing that we have clicked on is not.

28
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.800
The value of the part of the object, we do not want to move forward, we just want to terminate the

29
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.850
program right there.

30
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.890
Right.

31
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.660
It means that whenever we are not clicking on the key itself, which is the value, if we are not clicking

32
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.490
on it, I hope you are getting the hand.

33
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.840
If we are not clicking on it, do not proceed with the program.

34
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:39.210
So if we are not clicking on it, we are just going to use our not and selector.

35
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.670
Right.

36
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.450
So this is the not sorry, the not operator.

37
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.150
And we are going to say if it is not the value for the path for the event object, do what?

38
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.390
Just go ahead and return.

39
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.800
I mean, we don't have curly braces here because this is just one word.

40
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.590
So this is this is logical.

41
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.720
You can do this if there is only one return, Keywell, you don't have to provide the parentheses,

42
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.510
the curly braces for the if statement.

43
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.920
Right.

44
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.410
So what does this logical operator does this logical operator or first evaluates this condition and

45
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.090
then it multiplies the condition by in negative?

46
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.940
So if we are not clicking on the key, if we are not clicking on the key, then return.

47
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.800
It means just wrap up everything.

48
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.220
So if I if I do not click on the key.

49
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.880
So let's go ahead and let's save it.

50
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.640
If that path, that value is.

51
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.080
They're going to grab the first index and we're going to say for each the first index.

52
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.720
All right, we still get our air, but this ever happens before this if statement, I can I can, like,

53
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.470
show you how this works, actually.

54
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.560
So I'm just going to go ahead and consider the like two plus two.

55
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.400
And when I save it and when I click here, you guys can see that this two plus two has not been locked

56
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.670
to the console because the program has been terminated here right before the IF statement.

57
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.040
And this error comes from after just line number 13.

58
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.600
So this is line number 13.

59
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.230
So if we were to click just trash this, if we were to click on the key, we should be able to two by

60
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.530
two.

61
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.260
We should be able to see two by two equal to four.

62
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.590
And this is over four.

63
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.580
So unless we click on any key, this the code that comes after this, if statement is not going to run.

64
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.260
So let's come in this one out.

65
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.170
Let's click on this.

66
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.910
We are going to see for click here.

67
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.250
We are not going to see anything.

68
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.900
So if it is if it is something that we are we have been clicked on it.

69
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.800
What do we want to do?

70
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.350
First off, let's go ahead and let's capture it.

71
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.240
What is it that we want to capture?

72
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.590
It's basically this thing.

73
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.140
And we are going to say key collect.

74
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:10.140
And we are going to capture this, so we are now the result of this is always going to be a letter and

75
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.740
we are going to save it inside the key collect variable.

76
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.270
And then what I want to do is I want to get our text area and I want to add a value to it.

77
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.140
And where does the value is going to come?

78
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.610
It is going to come from the key collect variable and that's it.

79
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.620
There is one more thing missing, but I have to show you how this works to be able to show you how where

80
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.590
that one thing is.

81
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.620
So if I click on this, we are going to click on the double click CWG edge.

82
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.400
You why we are going to see space.

83
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.090
So let's bring the body down.

84
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.930
You're going to see space for this space to see X, Z, S and A and W.

85
00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:01.470
And, you know, the problem with this is whenever we click a key, the previously clicked key is going

86
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.890
to be overwritten by the current the key.

87
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.730
All right.

88
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.750
So we still have these here.

89
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.270
So let's say we want to write out.

90
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:21.290
For example, like book, so be when I click on the oh, we are going to see that the O replaces the

91
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.560
P.

92
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.580
And when I click on the another O, because both of them are O, it doesn't show.

93
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:35.480
But when I click on the K, we are going to see that this O has been replaced by K, so how can we remove

94
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.100
this problem and we just add a plus sign to it.

95
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:50.330
So we say whenever we say whenever the key is clicked, we want to add on to the value of the text area.

96
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.470
We don't want and we don't want this to be valid, to be the value of the text area.

97
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.950
We want to add on to the value of the text area.

98
00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.800
All right.

99
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.340
And so now let's go ahead.

100
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.520
Let's save this.

101
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.940
So now let's go ahead and let's write B and now when I click O, it is going to add it onto the B and

102
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:19.310
when I click another oh it is going to add it on to the the previous O and now we can write book is.

103
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.850
Here.

104
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:31.160
And now with key word, we could just say, seriously, seriously, if I can spell it out, is it correct?

105
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.830
I think so.

106
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.680
Seriously?

107
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.040
All right.

108
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.080
So this is going to be it for this project.

109
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.960
See you guys in the next one.
