1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,130
Hi, everyone, in this that year, we are going to start talking about Arae methods.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:16,079
All right, so the first method that I want to talk about is the shift shift method, and this method

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,700
removes items of an array or values from an array from the start.

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,160
So let's go ahead and let's create an array of movies.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,260
All right.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,910
And I'm going to name them the lake house.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,650
The lake house.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,660
And I'm just initially I'm going to provide two movies inside this array and I'm going to create another

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,240
string memento.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,900
And let's go ahead and cancel the log movies.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,850
Let's save it and then you guys can see that this area has a length of two, right?

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,150
We have the lake house and we have momentum.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,870
Right.

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,800
And now let's go ahead and let's remove from the start of this array.

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,240
Right.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,470
And for that, we are going to grab our array.

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,160
All right.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,430
And we are going to grab our array and we are going to close the shift method because shift is a method.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,290
We should provide it with parenthesis.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:13,650
Right.

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,770
And then we are going to consider log our array one more time and then we guys can see that the first

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,090
array has and the first area has also been changed.

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,770
But in here in the first array, we have the lake house and the memento.

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,520
And when we call the movies that shift, the lake house has been deleted.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,290
And we only we are only left with the momentum and the length is going to be one.

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,400
The index is zero.

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,140
Right.

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,680
So this is the shift method that we have.

29
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,500
Right.

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,870
I'm just going to comment on all kinds of dialogues and I'm going to keep this the second method.

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,860
I'm just going to name these methods as well.

32
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,820
So this is a shift method.

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,650
The second method that I want to talk about is the UN's shift on shift method.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,760
And this method adds to the start of an array.

35
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,479
Keep in mind, shift on shift, they remove or at from the start for the end.

36
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,930
Do we have other methods?

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,300
Right.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,700
So we are going to grab our movies, movies.

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,990
Right.

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,070
And we are going to say on shift.

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,820
And because this is a method we are going to provide it with parentheses and what do we want to add

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,680
to the start of this array?

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,980
I'm just going to come in here, removes from the start, right.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,050
And this one adds to the start, right?

45
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,260
So it's not confusing.

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,560
We are going to add to the start The Great Gatsby.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,560
When we say it now, let's go ahead and let's consider our Ray.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,160
And now you guys can see, so our original story has the Lake House and Memento, but The Great Gatsby

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,320
has been added to the start of this era.

50
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,440
So this is the uncuffed method.

51
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,100
The next method that I want to talk about is the pop method.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,000
It is the top, so it is method number three, it is pop method, and it does exactly what the name

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,780
suggests.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:28,690
It pops an item from the end of an array, removes from the end, it removes from the end of an array.

55
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,400
So we are going to grab our movies array and we are going to say pop and that set.

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,930
And now let's go ahead and let's consider the longer array as well so we can see the changes.

57
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,780
And now you guys can see, because our original array has two items inside of it.

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,010
It has the lake house and Memento.

59
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,680
Memento has been pumped from the from the end of the array.

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,510
And we are left with the lake house.

61
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,290
All right.

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,940
So this is the pop method.

63
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,160
The next method that I want to talk about is the push method, which adds to the end of an array push

64
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,730
method.

65
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,730
Adds to the end.

66
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,209
All right, so first off, let's go ahead and let's let's call our Iran.

67
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:27,590
So this is our right and we are going to say that push, because this is a method we provided with parentheses.

68
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,900
And let's push to this array, another movie which is departed.

69
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,010
All right.

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,390
And now let's go ahead and let's check it out inside the console as well.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,270
So originally we have lake house momento and now we have lake house momento and departed.

72
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:46,960
Right.

73
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,120
So this is how we can add to that.

74
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,790
So now we know how to remove from the start, add to the start, remove from the end and add to the

75
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,240
end.

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,600
All right.

77
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,570
The next method that I want to talk about is.

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,330
The slice method now this returns a piece of the array, for example.

79
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,010
This is where I'm going to come and out the array and I'm going to create another array here.

80
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,960
First off, let's go ahead and let's create an array of numbers.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:15,950
Right.

82
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,720
And we are going to set it to one to three, four.

83
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,880
I mean, this is 54 hundred and fifteen.

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,520
That's 789.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,790
Maybe like seven.

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,490
Eighty nine.

87
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,100
That's three.

88
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,160
Twenty four.

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,670
That's it.

90
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:41,900
So this is our right now what what's what this slice method does is it returns a piece of this array

91
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,410
as a as another array.

92
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:51,470
So it copies this, it grabs this array and then it slices there and it returns that slice that we want.

93
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,930
OK, so in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to write this is our method number five.

94
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,970
We are going to say slice method.

95
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,600
And for your reference, I'm just going to add in here so we have a slice.

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:13,730
This is the syntax and the arguments that this slice method is going to accept a starting index and

97
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,280
ending index.

98
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,660
OK, this is just as a reference free.

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,550
And I'm sure the slice name is comprehensive enough.

100
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,800
So what we are going to do is we're going to say, for example, and whenever it provides us with that

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,720
slice, what I'm going to do is I'm going to store that slice in another variable.

102
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:42,080
So I'm going to say let no one be equal to OK, so let's grab our array.

103
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,640
And the array is numbers.

104
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,340
So this is our array and we are going to say that slice.

105
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,150
So what is this starting index and what is the ending index?

106
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,310
I'm just going to cancel the log our array numbers.

107
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,980
Let's consider log it.

108
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,170
So let's say we want the starting index to be one and the index and the ending index to be four.

109
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,370
So let's put it let's put it to one and four.

110
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,420
Let's save it.

111
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,830
And now let's consider log this one as well.

112
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:20,230
So this is number one, and then we can see we have two, three and four because the starting index

113
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,940
was was one and the ending index was four.

114
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,260
Right.

115
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,020
So we get two, three and four.

116
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,420
It doesn't capture the ending index.

117
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,120
It only captures the starting index and it goes all the way to the ending index.

118
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,260
So we have two, three and four.

119
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,740
Right.

120
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,800
So this is how the slice method works.

121
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:46,060
There are a couple of other variations that we can use with the slice method, for example.

122
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:53,650
We can also I'm just going to come in this one out and I'm going to say let no one be equal to we can

123
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,650
use negative numbers as well.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,990
We can use negative indices as well.

125
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:06,130
So the index, they start from positive numbers for start from zero zero zero one, two, three, four,

126
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,400
five, six and seven.

127
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,470
So this is ours.

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,270
But what if we want to count from the other way?

129
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,170
So from the other way, this is going to be negative one negative two negative three negative four negative

130
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,930
five negative six negative seven.

131
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,640
And this is going to be negative eight.

132
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,230
All right.

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:30,280
So let's go ahead and let's say we grab our numbers array and yeah, we call the slice method on it

134
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:37,030
and we want we want to grab items from from the end of the array by two.

135
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,220
So we just add, for example, if I just add negative one, we are going to get we are going to grab

136
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,770
the last item because the negative one, the end is the index of the last item.

137
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,340
All right.

138
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,070
But if I add negative to.

139
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,070
Negative.

140
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:00,780
We are going to get our negative one and negative two because now we are slicing from here all the way

141
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,140
to here, right.

142
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:10,050
So we can go ahead and add some let me put it back to one and commented out, common this one out.

143
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm going to do one more and I'm going to put it to four.

144
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,920
So this is negative one, negative two, negative three and negative four.

145
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,990
So you guys can see it has created another array for us.

146
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,490
This is a copy of this array and we have the numbers that we have desired.

147
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,550
So this is negative one, two, negative three and negative four.

148
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,950
So it has grabbed all the all four numbers and it has created another array for us.

149
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,050
This is the slowest method and the final method that I want to talk in this video to talk about in this

150
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,910
video is the splice method.

151
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:50,380
And this method, it changes the original array by removing or replacing existing items from an array.

152
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,040
All right.

153
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,180
So for this, we have to capture the array inside another variable as well.

154
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:02,450
So first off, we are going to say this is method number six and this is Pliss method.

155
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,580
Keep in mind, this changes our array, OK?

156
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,330
And for your four for your eyes, I'm just going to provide it with the arguments.

157
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,840
So the first argument is going to be our starting index, and the second argument is going to be a number

158
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,860
of items to be removed, removed.

159
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,320
All right.

160
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,020
So let's go ahead and let's grab we are going to work with our numbers.

161
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,350
Right.

162
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,450
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say number two should be equal to splice.

163
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,080
Right.

164
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,160
First off, we should reference our array.

165
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,340
It is numbers that and then we call the method and it is splice.

166
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,650
Right.

167
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,720
Because this is a method we provided with parentheses.

168
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,210
So what is this starting index?

169
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,770
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at it.

170
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,830
Let's save it for now.

171
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,400
And we see OK, so let's say the starting index is zero and we want it to go by four.

172
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,570
OK, so this is the starting index and the number of items to be removed.

173
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,730
So I wanted to start from zero and I want to remove four items.

174
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,470
Right.

175
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,780
And now let's go ahead and let's call it one more time.

176
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,430
Let's just call this one number two and let's save it.

177
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,620
So now you guys can see that it has it has spliced out of this array, this one.

178
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,410
All right.

179
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,080
So if I were to consider log our numbers there, you guys can see that this is our numbers are going

180
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,130
to come out, this one.

181
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,570
So it is crystal clear you guys can see that our numbers area has been changed.

182
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,910
It changes the original array by splicing it.

183
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,240
Right.

184
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,550
So this is the first way that we can do it.

185
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,780
It either removes or replaces or adds.

186
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,060
OK, so we are going to talk about all three, all three possible combinations.

187
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,810
So this was removing.

188
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:07,510
OK, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to come in this one out and the next one is removing and replacing.

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,160
We are going to remove and replace.

190
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,920
We are going to say it numb to be equal to numbers.

191
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,610
Numbers, dot supplies, right?

192
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,090
So what is the starting index, the starting index now?

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,180
I don't know.

194
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,560
Let's put it to zero again.

195
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,540
This is the starting index.

196
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,390
So this is the starting index.

197
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,330
How many items do we want to remove?

198
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,080
We want to remove two items.

199
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,240
Now, this is also called replacing.

200
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,610
All right.

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,890
So we can't replace these two items by two other numbers as well.

202
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,630
So the first item inside Aurora is number one.

203
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,390
The second item is number two.

204
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,450
So we have successfully chosen number one and number two, and we can replace them by one hundred and

205
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,930
eleven and two hundred and twenty two.

206
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,840
Let's save it.

207
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,180
Let's check out both of our arrays here.

208
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,860
Uncommon them.

209
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:11,150
And now you can see we have spliced out one and two and we have successfully changed the original array

210
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,630
from one, two, three, four and whatever to one one, one, two, two, two, three, four, and whatever.

211
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,300
So this is removing and replacing.

212
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,710
I'm going to go over this syntax one more time.

213
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,400
This is the starting index.

214
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,520
This is the number of items that we want to remove.

215
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,370
And this these are the items that we want to replace with those items that we have just removed.

216
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,520
It's that simple, right?

217
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,040
So this is a removing and replacing, there is another scenario that is just adding it if you want to

218
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,390
just add it, OK?

219
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,220
And for that, I'm just going to copy this one and I'm going to post it here and I'm going to uncommented

220
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,810
all of that.

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,540
And we are going to say that we want to start from the index of two, but we do not want to remove any.

222
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,880
So if you do not want to remove any, you just provide the number of items to be removed equal to zero.

223
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:12,290
So if you make the zero, then none of the items from our original array of numbers is going to be removed.

224
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,730
But still, we would be adding one, one, one and two to two to the original array.

225
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,570
Let's save it.

226
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,320
And then you can see originally that's coming this one.

227
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,160
And originally the length of our array is eight.

228
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,760
But now we have successfully added two more items without removing to there.

229
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,060
OK, so the starting index of this item is two.

230
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,100
So the starting index, this has been changed as well because it changes the original array.

231
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
So this is zero.

232
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,190
This is one.

233
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,780
And what is the index of this?

234
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,390
This is this has an index of two.

235
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:56,130
And we have successfully provided two new items to our array without removing any item from the array.

236
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm going to go over this syntax one more time.

237
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,020
We want to start from the index of two, but we do not want to remove anything.

238
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,850
That's why we provided with zero.

239
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,380
But we want to add we don't want to remove.

240
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,300
We just want to add.

241
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,970
So when we want to add, we just provide it with the number of items that we want to add with the items

242
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,870
that we want to add.

243
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,350
All right.

244
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,150
So that's it for this lecture, guys.

245
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,740
See you in the next one.
