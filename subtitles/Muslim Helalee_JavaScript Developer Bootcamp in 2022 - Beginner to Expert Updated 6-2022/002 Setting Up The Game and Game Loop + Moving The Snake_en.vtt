00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:07.330
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will be setting up our game and the game, Luke.

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.600
All right, so the way that I've created this game is that we do have a canvas element, there are some

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.550
basic styling that I'm not going to go over.

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.010
So we are just straight forward jump.

5
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.630
We are going to jump into the JavaScript file.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.720
So first off, let's create a canvas element and we are going to say document now because it is in the

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.410
HTML.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.430
We need to select it.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.790
Right.

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.400
So query selector.

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.850
Canvas and the context, I'm just going to call it Cong's, right, and it is going to be canvas element

12
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.460
does not get context and it is going to be tudy perfect.

13
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.800
Let's give the canvas some height.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.020
So the height of the canvas is going to be 400.

15
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.600
The canvas elements with.

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:13.670
Is as well 400, let's create our game parameters, so game parameters and now our speed is going to

17
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.330
be seven.

18
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.320
Right.

19
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.920
So it is going to be seven.

20
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.570
We are going to have a number of tiles, so the tile count is 20.

21
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.310
We have too many tiles and we have 400 of with and 400 of height.

22
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.600
So basically, we have to enter into 20 title tiles.

23
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.920
All right.

24
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.440
So these tiles are actually where the snake actually moves.

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.820
So the snake is not like randomly moving on the screen.

26
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.720
The snake is moving on these tiles.

27
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.390
We are going to have a position for the head of the snake.

28
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.380
So we are going to say Sneyd Hech Head X, so the horizontal position of the head of the snake, that

29
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.670
is going to be 10, the vertical.

30
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.390
So Snake Head Y is also going to be 10.

31
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:17.860
Our initial initial X velocity is going to be zero, our initial Y velocity is going to be zero and

32
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.920
I'm going to provide the position for our snack as well.

33
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.740
So I'm going to say let snack.

34
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.000
This is going to be the exposition of the snark, which is five, and these parameters are going to

35
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.820
kick in whenever we start the game and we are going to say snack y, and that's also going to be to

36
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.200
the snake by default is going to have a tail and the tail is going to have a length.

37
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.080
So it is going to be snake tail length.

38
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.740
That is going to be close to two and our initial score is going to be zero because the score is drawn

39
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200
in JavaScript, perfect.

40
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.750
We do have only one derived dimension, derived dimension, and that is the tile size.

41
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.940
So tile count is 20.

42
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.320
What is the tile size?

43
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.150
The tile size is our canvas aliments with.

44
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.270
Uh, divided by.

45
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.120
The tile count, tile count, which which should give us like to twenty pixels, right to an end to

46
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.460
twenty.

47
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.690
We get 400.

48
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.850
Perfect.

49
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.210
Now let's go ahead and let's actually create the game loop.

50
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:49.950
So in here, I'm just going to create this kind of comment and I'm going to say the game loop.

51
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.170
And in here, let's go ahead and let's call the function.

52
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.990
Play a game.

53
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.360
Now, this we are going to do differently.

54
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.910
We are going we are not going to do request animation frame, we are not even going to do a set interval.

55
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.620
We are going to use another timer and that is set time out, said time out is going to grab is going

56
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.160
to do something for us in one second.

57
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.890
How many times the number of speed times and what is it going to do for us in that amount.

58
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.850
And it is going to call this function that many times in one second.

59
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.390
In one second.

60
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.090
So if I were to say console log running.

61
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:48.500
Running and we should actually call this mayor, call this function so it executes as well.

62
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.070
So let me go ahead and open this up with live server.

63
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.250
There we go.

64
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.130
So let me bring it here.

65
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.930
Let's inspect if I come here and if I zoom in a little bit, you can see that it is precisely being

66
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:13.360
called below that, precisely being called seven times per second, as opposed to our request animation

67
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:21.940
frame, which takes into account the FP sorry, the screen refresh rate, which is 60 hertz.

68
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.640
So it's refreshers or redraws the screen 60 times per second.

69
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.790
That is not something that we want y because as we increase the number of times the screen is being

70
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.210
redrawn, we are actually increasing the speed.

71
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.050
There we go.

72
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.900
That is the logic behind this game.

73
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.300
So let's say we put it to 10.

74
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.410
So that was you can see now it is faster.

75
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.480
It was seven.

76
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.520
Now it is 10.

77
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.760
If I put it to 30, it is going to execute this function 30 times per second.

78
00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:04.630
So the the more you want this function to be executed in per second, then the faster it has to go to

79
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.350
keep up with that one second.

80
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.770
So if I put it to 30, you can see that it is going to be way faster.

81
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:20.250
If we put it to our usual 60, you can see that it has executed 60 times per one second.

82
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.820
We don't want to do that.

83
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.540
We just want it to be executed seven times per second.

84
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.130
And then we will increment this whenever the score is increased or whenever the snake eats a snack.

85
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.970
We want to increase this by point five point one.

86
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.840
So seven point one, seven point two, seven point whatever.

87
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.550
And this is actually how we are going to create this game.

88
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.680
So now that that is out of the way, what I would like to do is I would like to create a function called

89
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.540
clear screen.

90
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.740
And this function is basically responsible for creating the screen that we have.

91
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.070
So I'm going to grab this comment and I'm going to put it right here.

92
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.850
It is going to be clear screen function.

93
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.390
So function clear screen.

94
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:25.420
Basically, we want to draw a the canvas now give it to background so that film style should be Bellac.

95
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:32.980
You can do you can do any color that you want and it is going to be fairly wrecked.

96
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:41.510
The exposition is going to be zero, the Y position zero, the with canvas elements with canvas element

97
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.240
dart width and the height canvas element tight.

98
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.650
Not that canvas element.

99
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.810
Let's save that and let's come here.

100
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.380
There we go.

101
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.490
That is our canvas.

102
00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.160
I'm just going to zoom out inside the console and put it here in case we have some errors.

103
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.750
There are.

104
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.170
Right.

105
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:09.880
So the next thing that I would like to do is I would like to set up an event, an event listener, and

106
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:17.680
that is going to listen for Arrow Keys event this tinner.

107
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.620
All right, and let's grab this comment and let's put it there.

108
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.610
Perfect.

109
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.860
So where the event is going to be attached to the document, not specifically a specific area, just

110
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.120
the document itself.

111
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.240
And the event is going to be key down.

112
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:43.390
So whenever the key is down, we want to do something that something is going to be done within the

113
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.960
context of this function.

114
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.580
So it is going to be the key down function now.

115
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:58.350
Why don't we go ahead and create that key down function, so I'm going to come beneath here and copy

116
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:10.230
that, let's put it here and let's say key down, so function key down, it is going to accept our event

117
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.640
object associated with this key down.

118
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.680
So we are going to grab.

119
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.180
So because we have four directions, we are going to create fourth statements.

120
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:28.020
Each of these statements is going to be responsible for with it responsible for a certain key code.

121
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.910
If that key code is pressed, we want the snake to go in that direction.

122
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.780
So first off, let's handle moving up.

123
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.380
So we are going to say f e that key code.

124
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:47.580
I think we have already talked about these key codes whenever we when we talked about that, move the

125
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.000
ball.

126
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.840
So basically this part is going to be the same as that project.

127
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.610
So for the key code of moving up, we have 38.

128
00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.640
That is the key code.

129
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:09.280
You can basically just say E Council Logi, just Sloggett E, and then I'd like to press on all the

130
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.840
keys and then that is going to give you the event is going to give you the event specific for that specific

131
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.180
key that you press is going to give you the keycard.

132
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.580
We have gone over it like a thousand times.

133
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.090
So if the key code is that what do we want to do?

134
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.440
We want to check if we are moving up or not.

135
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:35.430
So if the Y velocity equals one, it means we are moving up, right.

136
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.400
But when we are moving up, basically, what do we want to do?

137
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:55.110
Now this so we have 38, 37, 38, 39, 40, so the key is correct, so if the kicker is 38, we want

138
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.110
to go up, right.

139
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.080
But if the velocity is one, it means that it is going down.

140
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.030
We want to return.

141
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.180
We don't want to go up.

142
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.520
It means that we don't want to go in the same direction up and down.

143
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.490
I'm going to come in this one out so it makes more sense.

144
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.420
So if we want to go up the velocity, basically we just set it to minus one.

145
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.680
Perfect.

146
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.320
And the X velocity is going to be zero.

147
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.140
Perfect.

148
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.990
So this is moving up.

149
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:29.520
Let's handle moving down as well so we can really see what this comment is, all parties.

150
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:37.170
So for moving down, we are going to say minus one here and one here and the key code is going to be

151
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.680
40.

152
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.660
Let's save that.

153
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.710
Let's come here.

154
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.400
We haven't drawn our snake yet.

155
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:53.530
We should go ahead and draw our snake first before we can do anything with it.

156
00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:04.570
So to be able to actually see something here, I'm going to go ahead and draw our snake so the draw

157
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.650
snake function, we are going to call it within our game loop.

158
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.630
All right.

159
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:17.500
So beneath there, I'm just going to say draw snakes so we can actually see something beneath our clear

160
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.100
screen.

161
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.620
Copy that.

162
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.600
Put it here, we have drawer snake.

163
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.440
So it is going to be a function draw snake.

164
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.190
What do we want to do here now?

165
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.570
Basically, our snake is a rectangle, right?

166
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.670
So let's go ahead and draw a rectangle.

167
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:48.570
So we're going to say Phil style, the head of the snake itself is going to be green.

168
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.210
And what is going to be the position?

169
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.280
Now, we want the position to be wherever based on the tile count.

170
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.700
Right.

171
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.320
That we have.

172
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.490
So we want to say that.

173
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.410
Phil RACT.

174
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:13.100
It's going to be so let's grab this snake's head X and let's multiply it by the tail count, the tail

175
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.800
count is going to be 20, right.

176
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:24.560
And then we are going to grab the snake head y y position and multiply it by the tail count.

177
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.700
That is going to be another 20.

178
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:35.030
And then the size itself, the size of the head is going to be the tail size, the width and tail size,

179
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.690
the height.

180
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:43.700
So if I save that and come here, you can see that this is so far from here, all the way to here is

181
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.970
20 tails from here, all the way to here is 20 tails.

182
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.980
That's directly there, right?

183
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.160
So all right, so that our snake is drawn as well.

184
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.260
Now, let's see if we can actually move it so up, down.

185
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:08.080
It is not being moved because the reason for that is we are not actually changing the position.

186
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.120
We need to go ahead and change the position of the snake as well.

187
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:21.110
All right, so first off, let's go ahead and let's call that function, so change snake position.

188
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:30.660
All right, and let's go down the snake itself and in here, I'm going to grab that and I'm going to

189
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.360
put it right here and we are going to say change.

190
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.290
You know what?

191
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.560
I'm just going to grab it from here and put it right here.

192
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.020
Perfect.

193
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.700
So we are going to say function change snake position.

194
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.820
Now we want to change the position of the head of the snake.

195
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.120
Right.

196
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.620
The body we are not yet concerned about because we haven't drawn the body.

197
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.450
When we draw it, then we are going to concern ourselves.

198
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:07.260
Now we want to change this position by the amount of weight velocity in the X with the X velocity,

199
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.780
Y with the Y velocity.

200
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.770
So we are going to grab the head and we are going to add onto the X velocity.

201
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.710
Let's do the same thing for Y.

202
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.180
That is going to be why and.

203
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.310
This is going to be why as well, and let's save it.

204
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:35.480
Let's come here so you can see that I'm going up and when I press the down arrow, I'm going down.

205
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.880
But imagine that this snake has some body.

206
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.420
If you go off, how can you possibly coming down?

207
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.850
That is not possible.

208
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.340
For example, in this case, if I go up, I cannot come down.

209
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.730
You can see.

210
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.260
And it hits the the upper wall and it says game over.

211
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.800
That's why we are going to come in this one out these these ones.

212
00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.680
And sorry, because whenever we are moving in one certain direction, we do not want to immediately

213
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.110
go reverse.

214
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.970
That is not something that we want to do.

215
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.790
That's why we are returning from we are returning from the function.

216
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.470
So let's copy it a couple of times.

217
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.050
And next up, let's go to left left.

218
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:25.890
Now, if the key code for left is going to be 37, perfect.

219
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:33.180
If it is 37, first off, we need to check if it isn't if we are not moving in the positive extraction.

220
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.070
Right.

221
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.010
So if it is in the positive direction, we are going to return.

222
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.630
Let's grab it.

223
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.530
Put it down here.

224
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:46.680
Now, the why the velocity for the X is going to be, of course, negative one and the Y is going to

225
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.190
be zero.

226
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.980
So we can only like travel.

227
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.610
The snake can only travel in one specific direction.

228
00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:02.880
And for right, the key code is going to be 39, first off, let's check if it is not moving to the

229
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:11.270
left, if it's moving, if it is moving there, just return and let's swap these two values, values,

230
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.060
dispositions.

231
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.579
And let's make the velocity zero and the X velocity plus one.

232
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:27.130
So now we should be able to move left, up, right, left, up, right, down, left, up, right,

233
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.510
down.

234
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:35.680
And of course, we are moving our out of the canvas because we have not added any collision detection,

235
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.110
but we are going to do that.

236
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.890
So that's it for this lecture.

237
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.400
See you guys in the next one.
