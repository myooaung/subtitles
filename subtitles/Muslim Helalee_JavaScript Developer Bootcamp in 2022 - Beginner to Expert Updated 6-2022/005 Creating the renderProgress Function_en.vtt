00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.900
Hi, everyone, in this next year, we're going to create the progress and counter functions.

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.490
All right, so first off, let's go into our necessary variables and in here I want to do some basically

3
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.480
I want to create some variables along with doing some calculations.

4
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.240
So I'm going to say CONSED, let's say let's create the question time first.

5
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.250
So the question the time for each question is going to be ten seconds.

6
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.910
And that's basically says 10 seconds.

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.430
All right, so the time for each question is 10 seconds.

8
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.730
Let's go ahead and let's create our gauge with so this is the gauge with whenever each second passes,

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.490
the gauge with is going to be like the color for that is going to be incremented by a certain number.

10
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.150
All right.

11
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.490
And this is where we create that.

12
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.920
And I'm going to send it to 800 and I'm going to tell you exactly where this 800 is coming from.

13
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.770
Now, the gauge with is the number for that is 800.

14
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.810
The reason for that is that this gauge that we have from here all the way to here, it is going to be

15
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.160
800 pixels.

16
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.540
And we can see that inside our success.

17
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.880
And we can see because the gauge itself, it is empty, the gauge is empty.

18
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.460
This gauge background, it is empty.

19
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.870
We don't see we don't have any we don't have any content for it.

20
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.560
We need to provide it with some sort of dimension.

21
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.190
So if I come down here, we can see that this gauge background, it has a height of 10 pixels.

22
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.720
So this height, this very little height is going to be 10 pixels and the width is going to be 800.

23
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.690
We could go ahead and increase the height to 100 pixels, which is not going to look good.

24
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.060
Right?

25
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.620
That's why it's ten pixels.

26
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.290
And now you know that this is actually the dimensions for this gauge.

27
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.050
So the dimension is 800 pixels.

28
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.730
We are not worried about the pixels for now.

29
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.030
We just want to get this 800.

30
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.520
So that's why the gauge with is 800 dynamically, which comes from the 800 pixels.

31
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.940
And the next concept, the next variable that I'm going to create is going to make the most sense.

32
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.520
This is going to be Gaige unit.

33
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.950
What is the gauge unit?

34
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.200
The gauge unit is the instrumentation of this gauge.

35
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.450
So each time this a second passes, we are going to see that this background, this color is being incremented.

36
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.500
What is this increment?

37
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.800
This increment each time is going to be 80 pixels because we have ten seconds.

38
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.450
Like this is very simple math.

39
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.120
We have ten seconds and we have a bar that is 800 pixels.

40
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.600
So eight hundred divided by ten seconds, we are going to get 80 pixels.

41
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:13.510
So if we want to sync this bar with this second, with this counter, we need to like divide this bar

42
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.900
into ten equal portions because we have ten seconds.

43
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:26.350
Each equal portion is going to be 80 pixels and we want to increment whenever each second passes.

44
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.340
We want to increment this bar or this gauge with 80 pixels.

45
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.890
And we need that 80 pixels to be calculated inside the JavaScript.

46
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.540
So we are going to grab our gauge with gauge with.

47
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.770
Uh.

48
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.730
Gaige, is it G, is it why OK, why is it?

49
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.200
Q It should be G.

50
00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:01.630
And is it G.U., A or Jiegu, I think it's Geet you, so let's say it doesn't really matter as long

51
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.250
as you understand what it says.

52
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.130
But I'm just going to set it to G.U..

53
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.870
I think it is here as well.

54
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.970
Yeah, it is a.

55
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:20.010
So where are we where we are right here, that's why it wasn't working, so GIU unit and not the unit

56
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.200
we want to grab the with and we want to divide it by the question time.

57
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.240
Where is the question time?

58
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.130
Where is it?

59
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.970
Yeah, here it is, so 800 divided by ten.

60
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.950
We are going to get 80, so the increment is going to be 80 pixels.

61
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:49.810
Semicolon, this is going to be 80 pixels, right, and I want to create another variable here, but

62
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.610
I'm not going to add any value to it and we are just going to initialize it.

63
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.200
Right.

64
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.090
So we are just going to initialize it and we are going to change.

65
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.250
We are going to change the value dynamically.

66
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.080
All right.

67
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.600
So let's come down here and let's create our.

68
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.000
Render progress function.

69
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.780
All right, so in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say render progress function.

70
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.270
So this is the function that that is responsible for creating these 10 boxes down here.

71
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.010
Right.

72
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.240
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say function, render progress.

73
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.530
There is no parameter.

74
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.650
And in here, what do we want to do?

75
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.270
We want to create 10 boxes dynamically, not one box, 10 boxes.

76
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.050
And these 10 boxes, they are related to ten questions.

77
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.900
So let's go ahead and let's use a for loop.

78
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.950
We are going to say let and we are going to create a very comprehensive loop variable that is going

79
00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:00.410
to say that is going to be question index and we are going to say it starts from zero and then the question

80
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.850
index.

81
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:11.190
As going to go all the way to Iraq to be equal or less than the value is going to be equal or less than

82
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.860
less than or equal to our last question.

83
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.410
And each time it runs, we are going to incremented by one.

84
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.780
And now now we have created a referral.

85
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.290
All right.

86
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.830
But what is this last question?

87
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.100
So let's take a look at it.

88
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.630
This is the last question.

89
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.580
The last question is going to be the questions, the length minus one.

90
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:42.550
So the last question is going to give us the index of the last item inside the array, which is nine.

91
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.260
All right.

92
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.530
So it is going to go all the way to be equal to nine.

93
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.550
And it is going to create those money because it starts from zero.

94
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.130
So it's zero one, two, three.

95
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.090
All the way to nine.

96
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.410
We are going to get 10.

97
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.850
Ten progress bars or ten progress boxes, right, to be more accurate.

98
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.760
Where do we want those progress boxes?

99
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:12.860
We are going to grab our progress that we have selected inside the progress container.

100
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.470
And we are going to say enter HTML.

101
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.930
We are going to add to that, but we are not going to we are not going to make it equal to that.

102
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.630
We are going to add it on to it.

103
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.000
We are going to appended to this progress container.

104
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.610
The reason for that is because we are creating ten of these.

105
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.430
If we if we simply say an equal sign, it is going to create the first one.

106
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.160
And then when the second one is created, the second one is going to be the first one is going to be

107
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.630
replaced by the second one.

108
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.060
And then the third one is created.

109
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.150
The second one is going to be replaced by the third one.

110
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.990
Right.

111
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.510
But we do not want to replace anything by anyone and we want to add on.

112
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.890
So when the first one is created, then we want to add a second one to it.

113
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.260
Then we want to add a third one to it and all the way to number 10.

114
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.990
So this is going to be another dynamic element as well.

115
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.360
We are going to create a diff.

116
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.740
This is going to be a diff and this diff is going to have a class.

117
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.810
The class is let's make sure that the syntax is correct.

118
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.240
The class is going to be progress.

119
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.730
Dasch box.

120
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.730
All right.

121
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.860
And we are also going to have an I.D. and you might ask, OK, where is this question?

122
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.050
And we are going to use it inside the ID.

123
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:37.460
So each time the question index has a number value, it is going to be it is going to specify the IED

124
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.669
for that specific div that we are creating here.

125
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:49.890
So I'm going to grab it and I'm going to say let's let's put it right here.

126
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.250
So this is going to be a requestion index.

127
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.450
And now let's add the closing tag as well.

128
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.330
Let's save it.

129
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:05.790
So now we have we should have successfully created 10 boxes until we just go ahead and render this progress.

130
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.560
All right.

131
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.940
So we should call this call this function.

132
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.780
Let's call it.

133
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.900
Let's save it and let's come in here.

134
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.250
We don't see that.

135
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.480
And

136
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.390
let's take a look at what could be wrong here.

137
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.680
So we have a progress container.

138
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.480
What is the progress container?

139
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.450
The progress container should be our progress container that we have here.

140
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:31.920
Right.

141
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.160
And if I come down here, we have said progress box.

142
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.560
The idea is going to come from here, render progress for question index.

143
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.940
Last question.

144
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.730
We have done everything correctly.

145
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.010
A right and.

146
00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.250
And I think the problem is not inside the JavaScript.

147
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:08.830
The problem is inside the success, because now that I'm thinking about it is I've used it in our final

148
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.700
product and then we're finished application.

149
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.900
I didn't use progress box.

150
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.860
I used progress bar, which is actually not accurate.

151
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.310
So I have to change this class to box.

152
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.490
So let's save it.

153
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.170
Let's come here.

154
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.100
And now we get 10.

155
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.150
So this the number of this comes from the number of questions that we have.

156
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:36.490
So if I were to come and our questions and let's say I just replicate this question two more times and

157
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.520
save it now, we should be able to see 12 boxes.

158
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.720
So this is a good thing that we do it through JavaScript.

159
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.920
So whenever you want to increase the number of questions, you do not need to worry about the number

160
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.600
of boxes that you need to be.

161
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.890
Either you need to increase as well because they are going to get increased automatically.

162
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.350
And dynamically so, we have successfully created our render of progress.

163
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:06.030
I wanted to create the render counter function in this lecture as well, but as it seems, it has been

164
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.200
postponed to the next lecture.

165
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.720
See you guys then.
