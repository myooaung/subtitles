00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.390
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.660
In this lecture, we are going to implement the size and shape manipulation.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:17.290
All right, so before implementing these functionalities, what do we have to do is we have to select

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.870
those specific inputs.

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.720
So what are we going to do is I'm going to create another variable and I'm going to call it size or

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.370
I'm just going to say block, block size just to differentiate between the name of the variable and

7
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.400
the ID name for that specific input.

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.870
Is it an input?

9
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.420
So this is the label for size?

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.250
Yes, it it is an input of type range.

11
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.410
All right.

12
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.930
So let's go ahead and a selected query selector and we are going to put in an idea of size.

13
00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.230
And the next thing that I want to select is going to be our shaped select I.D. So let's say shape.

14
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:12.610
Shape, select tour, document that query selector, and we are going to add an ID and we are going

15
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.510
to say Shaped Select and in case you're wondering about this I.D., it comes from right over here.

16
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.840
This is our select list that we have in here.

17
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.230
So we have selected the select list and we are going to tap into these options.

18
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.010
Right.

19
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.660
Using their values, so the first one has a value of one, the second one has a value to, that's how

20
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.980
this logic is implemented.

21
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.060
All right.

22
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.060
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to add another comment and I'm going to say size changer.

23
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.030
Size change.

24
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.000
Right.

25
00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.340
And we are going to grab our block size variable that we have created and we are going to add an event

26
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.920
listener.

27
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.630
Now let's think about what the event is going to be.

28
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:14.020
So if I come here and what I'm going to do is now this event, because we are changing the value of

29
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.190
this range slider, this event is going to be the same thing as these position positioning that we did

30
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.790
for our position Y and Position X. Basically, we are listening for a change event, not.

31
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.000
And whenever that event is fired, we are going to run a function.

32
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.340
The function is going to grab a reblock element, not size block element, and it is going to tap into

33
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.950
the world of styling and we are going to grab the transform, if I can spell it correctly, transform.

34
00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.770
And now, because we are sizing this and we want to do that through transformations now, whenever we

35
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.430
want to make an element bigger or make it smaller, the property or the function, the ceases function

36
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.390
that we want to use is going to be the scale.

37
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.100
So I'm just going to try to scale in here.

38
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.270
And we are going to and we are going to concatenate to spaces, so I'm just going to add a plus sign,

39
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.890
but before that is space and I'm going to add another plus sign and after that is space in here, we

40
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.830
are going to write the value that we the size that we want this block to get bigger by.

41
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.650
So we want to say that the size should be black dot, not block size.

42
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.800
Now, where does this block size come from?

43
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.560
This and this and should be good.

44
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:57.150
All right, so, yeah, another quotation is another quote is missing, let's say that it should yeah,

45
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.030
it has fixed it.

46
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.630
So what is this block size?

47
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.800
This block size is the input range that we have in here.

48
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.800
So where is it?

49
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.920
Yeah, this is this is the block size, right?

50
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.740
It is going to start from zero and it is going to go all the way to to the step is going to be zero

51
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.399
point one.

52
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.120
Right.

53
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.360
But we are we are not actually interested in this.

54
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.180
We are actually interested in the value for that.

55
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.510
The same way that the same thing that we have done for the position X and Y we are going to do for our

56
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.020
size.

57
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.250
So we are going to say dot value, dot value.

58
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.400
We are going to grab the value property of the block size.

59
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.770
Let's save it some here and now.

60
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.140
If I go down, the block is going to reduce.

61
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.110
If I go up, the block is going to get bigger.

62
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.720
So let's put it all almost in the center, I think.

63
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.090
Come on, buddy.

64
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.850
Come here.

65
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.160
Yeah.

66
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.630
So if I go to two, it is going to get bigger.

67
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.040
If I go to like here it is going to get very, very small there.

68
00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.930
There it is.

69
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.510
A block is getting bigger and smaller.

70
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.350
So this part is done, the next part that I want to create in this lecture, as well as going to be

71
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.970
the shape changer, right.

72
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.570
So for the shift change in what we are going to do is we are going to grab the OK button as well, because

73
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.080
whenever we select any shape and we click on the OK that the block is going to change shape.

74
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.520
So let's go ahead and let's select that as well.

75
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.550
We are going to call it OK, Beaton document dot query selector.

76
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.010
What is the ID for this button.

77
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.810
I think it's OK button.

78
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.110
So this is size.

79
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.300
Yes this is OK dash BTR.

80
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.450
So let's put in the numbers sine and OK button.

81
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.560
Now this event is going to be applied on the OK button because whenever we select an item from the list

82
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.390
and when we click OK, then the block is going to change shape.

83
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.960
So we are going to say OK, button dot at the center.

84
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.130
Right.

85
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.000
And the event for this one is going to be a simple click, and when the user clicks, we are going to

86
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.170
run a function.

87
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.600
So what is this function going to do?

88
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.860
All right, now this function is going to grab the value, OK, whereas the value of this select list,

89
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.180
whichever value that is, and according to that change a shape.

90
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.850
But in the case says we don't have any shape, for example, in here.

91
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.960
What I mean is in here we don't have any any circle.

92
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.110
OK, we have not created in a circle.

93
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.940
So the circle is created dynamically inside inside the JavaScript.

94
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.610
All right.

95
00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:03.360
So what we are going to do is we are going to create a variable and I'm going to call it shape option,

96
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.800
not shape shifter.

97
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:12.240
Of course, we are going to say we are going to grab these shapes selector and we are going to use the

98
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.160
value for that shape selector.

99
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.290
Let's go ahead and let's consider log it so we can see what this actually is.

100
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.090
Shape our option.

101
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.530
All right.

102
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.100
So now if I come here and that's going to inspect, let's go to console.

103
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:34.440
So now if I go ahead and if I select circle, the circle should have a value of two.

104
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.860
Right.

105
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.530
So now let's come here and let's click on the OK, we are going to get a value of two.

106
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.790
If I click on the square and click, we are going to see a value of one.

107
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.500
And this is exactly what we want through this value.

108
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:57.170
We are going to decide whether that shape is a square, a circle, a rhombus or triangle, a rectangle,

109
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.700
whatever.

110
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.220
Right.

111
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.730
So you can add as many shapes as you want as long as you add them dynamically.

112
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.970
So in here, what we are going to do is because we are controlling the flow of this logic, we are going

113
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.260
to use an if statement.

114
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:17.190
We are going to say F shape option is equal to one.

115
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.470
Now, when the when it is equal to one, it means that we are going to end up with a square.

116
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.460
So now let's add the dimensions for that square in here.

117
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.450
We do already have a square there, but we need to make sure that that that square is not rotated in

118
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.130
any way.

119
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:34.520
Right.

120
00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.030
So we are going to say block element, not size.

121
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.360
Block element style.

122
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:52.960
Dot border, radius, border, the radius, all right, is equal to zero.

123
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.250
That's it.

124
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.240
And finally, we are going to say alse if.

125
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:07.490
Allies of the option, the shape option is equal to two now, one, when it is equal to two, it means

126
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.650
we have a circle.

127
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.540
All right, so this is the circle.

128
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.890
So how how can we create a circle from a square?

129
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.200
Basically, we just have to add a radius of 50 percent.

130
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.070
So I'm going to copy that were a radius and I'm going to put it here and I'm going to change it to 50

131
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.120
percent.

132
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.410
Save it.

133
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.440
It's come here.

134
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.900
So now if I put it to circle and click, this is going to be a circle.

135
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.660
If I go to square and click, we are going to we are going to end up with the square.

136
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:44.510
Now, you might ask, OK, this is an ounce statement, whereas the else because the ending statement

137
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.860
of any if statement should be announced.

138
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:55.430
OK, but the reason that I have not used ounce here because is because you might want to add more shapes

139
00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:02.960
to it and else basically says in any other scenario, we do not want to say in any other scenario,

140
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:12.710
the any other scenario could be like a diamond shape or rectangle shape, a triangle shape or a hexagon,

141
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.340
whatever.

142
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.870
Right.

143
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:20.690
So we don't want to say, for example, when the shape is a diamond, for example, when you have three

144
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.910
more three more options here, each of them is going to have a different value.

145
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:33.470
But when you add an else statement here, it is going to apply the same dynamic styles for all three

146
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.850
of them.

147
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.950
So you need to be specific with what you want.

148
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:44.360
We want when the shape option is one to have a square and one the shape option is still to have a circle.

149
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.840
You might and you might add another one, like, for example, when you when this shape option is three,

150
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.090
then you want a diamond shape.

151
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:53.810
Right.

152
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:59.520
So so you can add that inside an ounce of cloth or statement as well.

153
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.030
This is going to be it for this lecture.

154
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.680
See you guys in the next one.
