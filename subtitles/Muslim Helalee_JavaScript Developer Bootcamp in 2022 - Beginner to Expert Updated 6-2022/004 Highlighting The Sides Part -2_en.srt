1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,780
Welcome to part two of highlighting the site.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:15,020
All right, so first things first, I'm going to go to top, and I would like to create that mouse event

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,270
and I'm going to come underneath there.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,710
We are going to grab.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,630
I'm going to put in a comment here and I'm going to say mouse move.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,140
And this is going to be the mouse move event event listener.

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:41,160
Lost perfect, because we are going to have one for a mouse move and one for click or mouse click.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,650
So let's go let's go ahead and grab the canvas at the event.

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,460
Listener It is going to be a mouse move.

10
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:02,640
And we are when we are moving our mass, we are going to highlight great, right, so highlight great.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,030
So let's go ahead and let's actually create this function.

12
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:18,030
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create this function, been on top of or highlight a side

13
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,350
that we have created here, we are going to create that next.

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,680
So don't worry about it.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,040
We have two two methods that have the same name, but they're because they're in different scopes,

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,580
it shouldn't matter that much.

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,190
All right.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,960
So within this highlight, great.

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,560
We going to pass in our event object as well.

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,360
So function highlight.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,400
Great pass in the event object.

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,560
Now, if it is not player's turn, we want to return.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
Right.

24
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,390
All right, but that's not actually what it is that we want to do, because in this if statement, what

25
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:02,770
we actually want to do when the game ends is we want to check when the time is up, if the time is up,

26
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:10,090
if the time up or the time end is greater than zero, it means that the game has ended and we want to

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,560
return.

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,510
So instead of just switching now and actually

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,880
then coming back here and then doing the time.

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,900
And what I would like to do is I would like to create that time and variable first and then we are going

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,940
to pass because we do have a delay.

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:38,410
And the only thing that we don't have is going to be our time and variable that is going to be responsible

33
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,290
for the game over status.

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,580
So time and we are going to declare it right there and we are going to come here and we are going to

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,960
save time and is greater than zero.

36
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,240
We are going to return from this function.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,740
And I'm going to you know what, I'm going to save this, hopefully we are not going to see any weird

38
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,800
errors for that.

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,290
No, we didn't.

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,790
So let's go ahead and let's continue with our highlight great function.

41
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:20,580
So we want to get the mouse's position relative to the canvas, so we are going to say get mouse position.

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,270
Relative to.

43
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,490
Relative to canvas, so it is going to be so first off, describe the exposition, the exposition is

44
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:40,050
going to be that client X, but relative to canvas, it's going to be canvas direct that get bounding

45
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,170
client wreck that we have dot left.

46
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:52,110
And for the Y position, we are going to grab the top and it is going to be that client Y and it is

47
00:03:52,110 --> 00:04:03,810
going to be y smaller small letters y and then based on these positions we want to highlight the squares.

48
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:13,300
Squares side, and for that, we are going to call a highlight side function and we're going to pass

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,800
an X and Y.

50
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:22,010
The highlights side function is going to be the function that we have right here.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
All right, so.

52
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,480
Let me come in this one in and within this highlight a side function.

53
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,330
So it is going to call this one right, because they're in the same scope within this.

54
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,150
First off, let's go ahead and let's be clear if there is any previous highlighting, we would like

55
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,770
to go ahead and get rid of it.

56
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:57,280
So we are going to say clear previous highlighting and let's come down here.

57
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,180
So let's go over the looping that so let's go over looping actually over our squares.

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,270
So for a row of squares.

59
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,760
So we do have our squares are right because we have rows and columns.

60
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,190
We are going to loop over it twice.

61
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,020
And the second time we are just going to call it square for let.

62
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:31,880
Square of row, and we want to we would like to grab our square, and from there we would like to grab

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,170
the highlight property and we are going to set it to know this is going to clear any existing highlighting

64
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,680
for us.

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,870
And then we are going to go ahead and we are going to check each cell.

66
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,530
Right, for if that cell has been highlighted.

67
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,670
So we are going to call in rows.

68
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,550
The rows are going to be the squares length, that length.

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,670
The squares that length, and then we have our columns as well, the columns are going to be if the

70
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,980
squares like the columns are going to be based on the indices of the square.

71
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:13,610
Right.

72
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,540
Not the length of the length of the indices of that square.

73
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,310
That is going to be the number of the column.

74
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:27,950
So we are going to grab our squares and from there we're going to grab the first item, first items

75
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,520
length.

76
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:37,380
OK, so let's go ahead and let's loop over this and check for whichever side has been highlighted.

77
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,600
We are going to sell it.

78
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,050
I equals zero and then I is going to be less than Rose.

79
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:52,280
So this person I'm going to Parsons is as well.

80
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,180
And we are going to increment I by one each time save that.

81
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,990
So let's come here.

82
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:08,210
And we are going to say that because this is looping over rows and you know that we have rows and columns,

83
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,250
we are going to iterate over columns as well so that J equals zero.

84
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,470
J is going to be the loop variable that is going to iterate over columns.

85
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,680
J is going to be less than the number of columns and each time we're going to increment by one.

86
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,820
Now, let's go ahead and let's create a statement here now we are going to say that whichever side that

87
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,930
we have highlighted, if it has the coordinates that we are just going to pass in here, then we want

88
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,650
that side to be highlighted.

89
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,460
All right.

90
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,510
So first, we need to check for that as well.

91
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,400
So, of course, I j has a we are going to call now.

92
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,270
We are going to call the contents function if it has these coordinates, what it is that we want to

93
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:08,320
do, we want to store that side inside the squares, the store, the side inside the side variable and

94
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,020
less person i j so I.

95
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:18,730
J basically means that each of each of those individual scores and if that is the case, we want to

96
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,620
call the highlights side on it.

97
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,780
With that same coordinates.

98
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,890
All right, so I think.

99
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,990
And finally, let's go ahead and let's actually.

100
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:45,790
Let's break out of it, let's break and I'm going to break out of the outer loop as well, so we are

101
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,860
going to say outer as well.

102
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,390
So this should be semicolon.

103
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,070
Let's save that and.

104
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go ahead and let's actually check for our hmm hmm.

105
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,070
We need to create this contains function as well.

106
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,960
And I see there is a problem here.

107
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,160
This should be askew, u.a.e.

108
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,280
Perfect.

109
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,460
So I'm going to go down there, I'm going to go down and I'm going to create that contains function.

110
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:26,850
So inside our class, the contents is only going to go ahead and contains as just responsible for passing

111
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,980
the X and Y coordinates of that, whichever score it is that we are hovering on it.

112
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:46,900
So this is going to return if X is greater than or equal to this dot left and if X is less than this

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,270
dot.

114
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,910
Right.

115
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,710
This should be and.

116
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,840
And why is greater than or equal to this top?

117
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,400
And also, why is less than this dot bottom?

118
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,750
All right, so the reason that we are doing this bullying in here is because we are actually grabbing

119
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,530
the center.

120
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,180
So it is either it is greater than the left, it is less than right.

121
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,690
It is greater than top.

122
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,860
It is less than bottom.

123
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,710
So it's directly in the middle of that square that we want.

124
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,050
So let's save this.

125
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,860
Let's come here.

126
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:37,490
We can see that we do have we still have our drawerful and we are not actually ready to do that.

127
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,720
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to create that function, but I'm not going to do anything

128
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,110
in it.

129
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:51,880
All right, so now the function is created here, and finally, after two lectures, we should be able

130
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,070
to see something real.

131
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,960
We can see that the error is gone because that draw and I'm just going to refresh it a couple of times.

132
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,560
So if I hover on it, we should be able to see some highlighting.

133
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,010
There we go.

134
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,780
So I'm hovering on there is going to give me show me that, you know what, excuse me, for the purposes

135
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:18,030
of this highlighting, I'm just going to reduce the number to four so you can really see, oh, I shouldn't

136
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,870
have done that.

137
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,530
I should reduce the number here.

138
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,700
So let's let's decrease the size of the grid to four to a four by four grid.

139
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,530
And there we go.

140
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,790
You can see that we have this is the orange color.

141
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,640
I think this is the eye or the or the player number two color that is being highlighted so far.

142
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,380
Refresh you can see that each time you refresh it is going to be completely random.

143
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,390
So it is still that still refresh.

144
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,740
And you can see now it is there.

145
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,500
So if I, if I hover there, it is going to highlight that side, this side, this side, this side.

146
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,300
And everything is working perfectly fine.

147
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,650
So you can see that we I'm actually being able to toggle this from the center of the square so you don't

148
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,860
even need need to have to go to that side to highlight it.

149
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,840
So you have to stand in the center.

150
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,600
If you go slightly towards the top, it is going to highlight up slightly towards the bottom.

151
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,360
It is going to highlight bottom right and then left.

152
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,530
That's exactly what the job of this.

153
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,280
Is.

154
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,760
The contents of this contains is it is going to give us the center for that square, right.

155
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,270
The center.

156
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,470
And if you move slightly to any side, you will be able to highlight it.

157
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,250
And we are not actually able to go ahead and fill it for that.

158
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,080
What we need to do is we need an event listener for for Kaleck.

159
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,500
And I'm not going to do that because we have done a lot of code and you need to go over that a few times.

160
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,000
And and just one more thing.

161
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,750
I would like to go ahead and I would like to decrease this by, I don't know, like two, because very

162
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:14,640
soon we will be testing this for the different conditions winning which player wins the score and all

163
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,000
of that.

164
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,560
So I just want to keep it out here and you can see the highlighting better.

165
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,160
So if I refresh and it is computer refresh.

166
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,320
Player one refresh.

167
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,960
PLAYER two OK, so we are done with the structure.

168
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,570
See you guys in the next one.
