00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,359
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,140
In this lecture, we are going to talk about the key event events and the event object.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,280
All right.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,379
So we have talked about the click of the mouse events, like when the user clicks, user double clicks,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,530
user mouse over, mouse is out.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,070
What about keyboard?

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,110
So these events, they're related to the keyboard.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,180
When the key is pressed, we have an event for that.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,050
That is the key down.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,040
When the key is released and key comes towards the top, that is key up.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,300
We have an event for that.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,410
And when the key is is like is like pressed, just like it's pressed, we have an event for that as

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:46,610
well.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,450
So we have a key down.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,400
When the key is pressed down, we have a key up when the key comes towards the top.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,250
When you release the key and when the key is pressed, simply pressed, we have an event for all three

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,570
of them.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,950
So first first things first.

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,660
Let's talk about the first keyboard event, which is key down.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:14,170
All right, so for this, what I'm going to do is I have created in the HTML and put element because

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,630
we are working with the keyboard, what are what better way than creating an input element?

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,640
So what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to grab our element, our input for element.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,170
So we are going to say text input.

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:40,030
This is the name of the variable and we are going to say document that query selector and we are going

25
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,000
to say now we can.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,190
There are a number of ways that we can grab that element.

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:54,010
The the way that I am going to grab it is going to be by its attribute and we are going to say grab

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,650
an element that has an attribute of type which is equal to.

29
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,310
It has type of text, save it and we can consider log it.

30
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,120
Text input.

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,880
Let's save it and voila, we have successfully implemented that, we have successfully selected that.

32
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,900
Now we have, if you remember right in the first lecturer's of the donc, we talked about how if you

33
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,250
want to do something with the dome, first we have to select and then we have to manipulate it.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,180
Now, the selection part is done, the manipulation part is still remain.

35
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:39,240
So we are going to say to extend that at Eventless in the event this time is going to be key down.

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,430
And when the key is pressed down, we don't care if the key is released or not.

37
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,560
We just care when the user presses the key.

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,900
That's when the user presses the key towards the down key is pressed down.

39
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,870
That's when the event is going to fire, because for a key up when the key is released, we have another

40
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,380
event.

41
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:11,260
We are going to say console dat lock, we are just going to simply say ke down.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,550
Key down, simple, so when I click here and when I press one, we're going to say.

43
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,680
And if I hold it, you guys aren't going to see that this is actually increasing because I'm keep on

44
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,960
keeping I kept pressing down.

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,620
The key I'm in the grammar is really difficult with this event listeners.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,650
So let's let's go ahead and reload the page.

47
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,940
And in here, when I press any key, when I press it towards the bottom, it is going to fire that event.

48
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,680
Right.

49
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,610
The event is going to fire.

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,650
And this is the key down event.

51
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,160
Right.

52
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,510
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to cancel comment that one out.

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,150
And now let's go ahead and let's talk about the key up now.

54
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,990
The key event only works when the key is released.

55
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:13,110
So let's go ahead and let's change it up and let's change this one two up as well.

56
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,310
All right.

57
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,510
So let's save it and let's click here.

58
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,839
So if I press it, nothing is going to change, even though we can see a lot of ones there.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,220
But when I release it, it says press key up.

60
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,320
So I'm just going to reload.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,900
So when I press it, nothing changes when I release it as this key up, key up, key up, key up.

62
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,100
So key up only works when the key is released.

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,280
Key down works when the key is pressed down, when the key is down, key up works when the key is up.

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,820
That's how simple it is.

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:55,170
So but the cool thing about these two events is it doesn't matter which key you press.

66
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,910
So even if I if I hit shift and if I release it, it is going to say that it is going to fire an event.

67
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,710
So I'm grabbing the assault on my keyboard and I'm pressing it down.

68
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,820
And when they release it, I'm just going to have to click somewhere.

69
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,960
So when I proceed down and when I release, it is going to say keep right.

70
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,550
And if I come this far out and come in this part and and now I am pressing the art and it is going to

71
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:31,140
say key down, key down is click the key down the second time, click their key down.

72
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,810
Key click there, because it happens only on the input, so I should be clicked in inside then.

73
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,810
Now I'm pressing the function key on the keyboard.

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,550
It doesn't work the control.

75
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,220
It does work.

76
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,640
That's why you can say this to anyone.

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,310
It is a counter, the alt.

78
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,740
It goes somewhere else.

79
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,800
The control works.

80
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,770
The arrow keys also work.

81
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,300
The shift key also works.

82
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,270
The function key I think also works.

83
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,020
It is increasing or decreasing the volume on the left.

84
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,170
It is increasing and decreasing the brightness.

85
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,100
They also work.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,510
Now this one doesn't work.

87
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,790
So this is key down.

88
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,960
It doesn't.

89
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,660
It also works whenever you're not actually pressing a you're not actually typing something.

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,420
But what if you want only to capture the user input when the user has typed something, that's when

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,540
the key press comes into play.

92
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,700
So let's grab this one.

93
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,610
Let's put it here and let's grab the key up.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,940
And you're going to say keep press, let's save it.

95
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,330
And it's like this in coming this end.

96
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,910
And now when I say MusclePharm, we are going to say we are going to see six key presses.

97
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,960
And when I when I just go ahead and reload it, when I hit control, it doesn't do anything.

98
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,860
It's not firing.

99
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,060
It's not firing what I do, comma.

100
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,600
It is going to fire when I do that.

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,890
It is going to fire when I do.

102
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

103
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,260
It is going to fire.

104
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,250
But when I do control, it's not going to fire because control is not something real time inside the

105
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,000
input field.

106
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,190
This is the difference between these three.

107
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,780
And finally, I want to talk about the event object itself for which the comment is this.

108
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,840
Now we have an event object.

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,020
We do have events and we have an event object.

110
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,020
So what I'm going to do is we are going to take a look at what is the event object.

111
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,490
And for that, we need a very, very big window for our.

112
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,080
All right.

113
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,090
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to do an event listener.

114
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,990
So, for example, let's grab I'm just going to copy and paste it here and and in this part.

115
00:07:52,990 --> 00:08:01,720
And we are going to listen for a click inside the input and it's going to say click and the console.

116
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,470
But this time the function is going to have a parameter.

117
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,960
So let me like go ahead and reduce the width of this window a little and increase this one.

118
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,800
So this time this function is going to have a parameter of E and now when I click, it is going to say

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,310
click.

120
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,210
But I don't want to say in the console, I don't want to say click.

121
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,450
I just want to return the key itself.

122
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,890
So when I click, this is the mouse event, see, so this is the event object.

123
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,500
It is going to give us a lot of useful information which we are going to use in our project is going

124
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,820
to give you a client X, client Y, where client X and Y give you the exact coordinates where you collect

125
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,010
inside that input.

126
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,150
So if I click somewhere, right.

127
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,130
If I click on the start, OK, we should have another client.

128
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,680
So Client X is ten and client Y is nineteen.

129
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,960
If I click at the end, Client X is 174 and client Y is seventeen.

130
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:02,860
All right.

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,070
So it's going to give you direct, like real and exact place where you have clicked.

132
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,150
We have path.

133
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,570
Let's see, we have timestamp, we have Target, which is a really, really, really important one,

134
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,060
which we are going to use a la target, especially in our gallery carousel project.

135
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
We're going to use Target.

136
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:31,250
And it is impressive and it's always it's even going to tell you what event, what event does it classify

137
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,600
as.

138
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,240
So if I go ahead and if I say target, let's save it and let's collect it is going to give us what is

139
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,980
the target that we have clicked on?

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,130
It is the target is the target is going to return the element.

141
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:52,460
So if we come here and if we take a look at the target, the target, the input, because some because

142
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,940
we want to find out what is exactly that we have clicked on.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,210
Is it an element?

144
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,480
Is it something else?

145
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,170
What is it that we have clicked on and we want to grab that element.

146
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,810
So this element, we want to grab it and we want to apply some sort of logic on it.

147
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:17,490
All right, and we could also go ahead and take a look at the key, so the key when I click the key

148
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,280
is undefined.

149
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
We don't have any key for this one.

150
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,970
So let's come here and see if we can find the key.

151
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:36,710
And we can look for Client X. So I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to paste it right here and

152
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,430
I'm going to save it.

153
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,170
So Client X is 80.

154
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,440
We can look for client Y as well.

155
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,510
So we are going to get one one, one, two and two one.

156
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:57,680
So this is actually the event object, we could also call it event itself, and we can just grab it

157
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,500
from here.

158
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,420
You know what?

159
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,110
I'm just going to click here, hold and click here, here and here.

160
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,330
And it is event.

161
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,700
And it should still work.

162
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,610
Yes, it does work.

163
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,820
We could call it evt.

164
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,810
That is a common convention as well.

165
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,320
And if you click it, everything is going to work.

166
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,070
But I usually just go ahead and I just call it.

167
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,240
You just call it E e.

168
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,140
S shoulder, and it's not a mouthful like event or event, and it looks better.

169
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,140
That's it for this lecture.

170
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,020
See you guys in the next one.
