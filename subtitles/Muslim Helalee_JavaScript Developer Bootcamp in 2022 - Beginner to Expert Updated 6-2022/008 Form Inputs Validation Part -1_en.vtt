00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.430
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to create a form of validation for when one or more of

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.050
our input feels are empty.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.850
All right, so I may not be able to complete this part in one in this this implementation in one lecture,

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.590
so it may span over two or three lectures.

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.250
So anyways, let's go ahead and let's do it.

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.990
So what it is that we want to do, we want to

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:44.900
validate the form, the form if one or more of the input feels are empty.

8
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.820
Okay, very good.

9
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.050
So first off, so this is programmed logic.

10
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.750
If one or more of input feels one or more of the input feels are empty.

11
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.540
So we are going to say if superhero.

12
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.850
Name equals an empty drink or superhero universe.

13
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:16.030
This is like simple English equals M is empty or superhero power.

14
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.190
Is empty.

15
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.260
What do I want to do, right, what it is that we want to do here?

16
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.330
So we want to for now, I just want to go ahead and say, Consul, lock error.

17
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:42.760
So let's do our and or else if they are not empty, so this this council is going to happen, whether

18
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.500
all three are empty, whether this one is empty and these two are felt, whether excuse me, whether

19
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.550
the middle one is felt and these two are empty.

20
00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.300
So in any other scenario, even if one of these is empty or even if all three are empty, desk else

21
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.230
is not going to run.

22
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.010
And this if statement is going to run because this condition is going to hold true.

23
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.930
If and if all of them are full and are not empty, are filled out, then this condition is not going

24
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.650
to return.

25
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.070
True.

26
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.420
It's going to return false.

27
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.050
So we are going to switch to the statement.

28
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.050
OK, what do we want to do in the house?

29
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.660
We want to grab these guys and we want to put them in the house.

30
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.800
Very simple.

31
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.420
See simple stuff.

32
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.410
So if I were to click, we are going to see error.

33
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.000
So there is our error.

34
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.100
If I put the Superman and now these two are empty and if I click, we are going to see error once more,

35
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.050
even if I fill out two of them.

36
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.760
And if I click, we are going to see error.

37
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.010
But if I put in the third one and click now, we don't see any error.

38
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.240
You can see that and we get our data printed, our data listed.

39
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.910
So this is what we did here and, well, actually, we don't want to just go ahead and log it to the

40
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.790
cons. We want to create a validation error message and a validation success method.

41
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.410
So what I'm going to do is we are going to add another method to the last instance of the superhero

42
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.100
class.

43
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.730
We are going to call it validation error.

44
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.550
All right, and we are going to create one for the allies, which is validation, success.

45
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.140
Oops, what is that?

46
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.830
That's.

47
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.530
Not something that I want.

48
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.760
So.

49
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.450
What is on top of this?

50
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.880
Let me come near.

51
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.100
Oh, is this a different language?

52
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.590
I want.

53
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.150
Oh, I'm I am I have no idea what's going on here, so I'm going to pause the video and I'm going to

54
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.490
figure out why the language is messed up.

55
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.130
So and then I'm just going to come back in just one second.

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.630
All right.

57
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.710
The error is gone.

58
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.580
Well, actually, I had Turkish language installed.

59
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.580
Actually, I'm learning Turkish, so that's what happened.

60
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.780
So I just removed it from here so it never happens again.

61
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.060
So we have our revalidation success and we have our validation error.

62
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.780
Now, what we need to do is we need to go up in here inside the superhero list class and create these

63
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780
two methods or functions.

64
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.370
Now, I'm I'm going to go over the concept.

65
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.700
Of course, we are not going to create them in this lecture.

66
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.300
Now, what is the concept?

67
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:43.040
The concept says that if even one of them or even if two of them or even if three of these inputs are

68
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.850
empty, run this function, what does this function going to do?

69
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.050
This function is going to print out this method message, even if even if one of them is empty or two

70
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.710
of them is to two of them is empty, it is going to run that function sorry, that message.

71
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.820
So that's the concept.

72
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.120
If all three of them are filled out, then run this part, which is the validation, success and add

73
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.000
superhero, unclear superhero and all that good stuff.

74
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.600
That's it for this lecture.

75
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.390
See you guys in the next one.
