00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,710
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to create the render counter function.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,960
All right, so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to create a comment and I'm going to say a

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,760
render counter function.

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,550
Let's go ahead and let's create the function and the function is called render render a counter.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,780
What do we want to do inside this render counter?

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,800
So to be like to be on this on the same page, this is the counter.

7
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,420
So now whenever we say render counter function, it is going to be responsible for this counter which

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,700
is increasing and for this bar, for this counter gauge or counter bar.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,720
Right.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,300
So what do I want to do?

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,360
I want to first sort of implement an if statement.

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,360
And the reason for that is I want to check for a condition.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,990
If that condition is true, I want to run a certain code and that if that condition is not true or is

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,600
false, I want to run a different condition, a different code.

15
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,620
So what are the two conditions?

16
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,690
The first condition is whenever this counter time is less than the question time.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,520
So the question time is 10 when the counter time is less than that, B, that whatever it whatever.

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,790
So either it is zero one or all the way to nine when it is less than that.

19
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,860
What do I want to do?

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,600
I want to increment it by one.

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,050
So if it is zero, I want incremented by one, if it is want incremented by two and so on and so forth.

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,830
And as I increment this, I want to, I want to increment this with this background color sorry.

23
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,740
This color, this purple color as well on this time gauge.

24
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:59,270
So I want to increment the number and I want increment this this segments that are coming here based

25
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,970
on the time.

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,840
So these are the two things that I want to do and add in the first condition.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,260
And if the condition is true, if the condition is not true, if the condition is false, I want to

28
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,300
grab this counter and I want to make it zero.

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,290
When is the condition false?

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,800
The condition is false when the count and the question time are equal.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,950
Now you can see the contestant and the question time is ten.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,990
You can see that we go to the next question and the count starts from zero.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,710
OK, now the next question that is a whole different story here is where the question now you can see

34
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,200
here, it says 10 and the question time is ten.

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,260
It means that the count and the question time, they are actually.

36
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,390
Equal and when it is equal, I want to I want to do something else, OK?

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,880
Well, actually, this is not accurate.

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,720
When there are equal or let me put it this way.

39
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:05,520
When the count when the count is equal to the question time or less than that, I want incremented.

40
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,230
Right.

41
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,720
But when the count gets bigger.

42
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,230
Right.

43
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,350
So when the count is 11, I just said one, it is equal.

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,590
I'm going to incremented.

45
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:16,950
All right.

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,820
And one, I increment 10, it is going to be 11.

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:28,710
And when it is 11, it is no more less than Question Time or equal to that.

48
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,220
And then our condition is going to be false when it is false.

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,590
I want to reset the counter, so let's go ahead and let's just dive into code because it is way easier

50
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,810
whenever we just dive into code.

51
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,780
So we have created our account right here.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Maybe I should like put it down here.

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,370
We have created the count and initially the value is going to be zero.

54
00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:00,840
So I'm going to say if count is less than or equal to the question time, we know what the question

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,350
time is.

56
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,720
The question time is ten.

57
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,310
We have created it there.

58
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:13,860
If the count is equal less than or equal to Question Time, it means that the count is zero all the

59
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,529
way to nine and equal, which is ten.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,440
So in all the scenarios, we are going to grab our counter diff from the e-mail and we are going to

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,070
say DOT enter e-mail and the e-mail is going to grab the count into consideration.

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,330
All right.

63
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,650
So let's come here.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,140
We still don't see anything.

65
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:44,980
And here, because we are not actually evaluating that, we are not running the surrender of Kandahar,

66
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,520
so render a counter function, let's run it, check out it.

67
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,320
Yes, we Cesira because we because the count has a default value of zero.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,060
If I said it to 500 and we are going to suffer, you're not going to see 500.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,940
Why is that?

70
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,750
This is a cool thing that I just did.

71
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:14,950
The reason that we do not see it is because 500 is neither less than nor equal to the Question Time,

72
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,570
which is 10.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,480
That's why it did not run.

74
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,800
So if I put it to nine and save it, we are going to see nine, even if I put it to 10.

75
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,520
Even if I put it to 10, we are going to see it.

76
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:35,520
That's why we we say equal to or less than or equal to Question Time.

77
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:42,000
If we just say less than we are not, we are never going to see the count turn 10.

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,330
Whenever we say we see equal, it is going to be ten.

79
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,750
And then after that we are going to go to we are going to get get our counter and make it zero.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,980
So, so now that everything is established, let's make it zero once more.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,030
When the count, whatever the counters, we want to increment the time gauge by that amount.

82
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,680
So let's grab our time gauge and we are going to say dot style.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,970
Dot with.

84
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:23,500
All right, it should be equal to the Count Times, tire gauge unit gauge unit, and we are going to

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,050
add a pixel value to it.

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,220
And after this is done, it means we are at the second of zero when it when it is zero.

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,520
What do I want to do?

88
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,070
I want incremented by one so it becomes one.

89
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,120
And when it is one then I want incremented by one.

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,870
So it gets to let's save it.

91
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,680
Let's come here.

92
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:55,220
Well actually we don't see it yet and we get our count if this condition is true.

93
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,830
Question.

94
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,920
Question.

95
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,290
There is no timer.

96
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,490
Of course the timer.

97
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,510
There is no timer.

98
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,270
And we should set a timer.

99
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,870
And because we want this render counter now this render counter, it runs only once.

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,230
We don't want it to run.

101
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,230
Once we want it to run as like forever, like run until the questions they are ended.

102
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,040
So in the else block, I'm going to explain this if statement, because I think it's a bit confusing.

103
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,440
So and the Alps, we are just going to get our count and we're going to make it zero.

104
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,920
So what does this statement do?

105
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,460
This statement is going to grab the value of.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,390
So we know that inside this parenthesis we have our condition.

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,390
We have gone over that.

108
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,290
Excuse me if the count is equal to or less than Question Time.

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,760
So initially the count is going to be zero.

110
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,940
Zero is less than Question Time.

111
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,440
So this statement is true and this code is going to run this code.

112
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,830
So the count is zero.

113
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,680
Zero is going to come here and we are going to see underpays zero and then zero is going to be inserted

114
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
here zero times the gauge unit.

115
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,160
What is the gauge unit?

116
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,740
The gauge unit is the length of the width is the width according to the width that we want to ekrem

117
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,840
incremented by.

118
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,080
And that width has a background color.

119
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,090
Where is it?

120
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,720
This is the background color for that with which is like a sort of purple color.

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,560
All right.

122
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,180
And we are getting that gauge with with this with with this gauge unit that we have here.

123
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,740
So if I passan zero here, zero times gauge unit, we get a zero.

124
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,250
So the gauge is not going to be incremented.

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,330
And then because we have zero, we are going to increment it by one and then we get one and then one

126
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,659
is going to be passed here.

127
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,800
This condition is going to be evaluated to true because Question Time is ten.

128
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,630
Keep that in mind.

129
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,250
Then we are going to pass in one here and one here.

130
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,550
When we pass in one inside the counter that increased on the page, we are going to see one.

131
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:06,600
And when we pass in one into the time gauge that stands out with one times gauge unit gauge unit is

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,080
eighty.

133
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,600
It's right here.

134
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,930
So one times eighty we are going to get eighty, eighty plus pixels.

135
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,400
We are going to get eighty pixels.

136
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,580
So the width of the time gauge which is right here, is going to be worth what you can see that I have

137
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,740
given it a height, but there is no width because the width is going to be added dynamically and the

138
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,510
width is eighty and then the width is eighty and this background color is going to be applied.

139
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,130
And then we go into another iteration, another another iteration.

140
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,000
Then because we increment one by one, it is we are going to get two and this condition is going to

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,930
run as long as this condition is not true anymore.

142
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,910
So in the final iteration, we are going to get ten.

143
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,390
When we increment ten, we, for example, when we get ten, ten is going to be true.

144
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,260
We are going to get ten on the page through this code and the final segment is going to have its background

145
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,250
color of purple.

146
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,420
And then when we increment ten by one, it is going to be eleven.

147
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,490
Eleven is not going to be true.

148
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,570
So this extension is not going to run and then the else is going to run and the else says that I'm going

149
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,700
to grab the count and I'm going to make a zero.

150
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,350
Voila, that's it, very, very simple, right?

151
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,120
So at the end, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to grab our Taimur.

152
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:36,120
Taimyr, come on, buddy, and we are going to set we are going to set an interval and this is a very

153
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,770
useful function in JavaScript.

154
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,030
So first stuff, what is it that we want to set the interval on?

155
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:50,520
It is the ORENDER counter that we want to set the interval and how after what is the interval time that

156
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,090
we want this function to run?

157
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,240
So I want this function to run after each one second.

158
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,190
So I'm going to add in 1000 milliseconds.

159
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,120
So timer handler.

160
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,560
So first one is going to be handler and then the time the timer is going to be 1000 milliseconds or

161
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,250
one second.

162
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,010
So now if I come here, we can see that this counter is going to be incremented by.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,500
By one second or 1000 milliseconds, and when it reaches to 10, it is not going to go to 11.

164
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,230
The reason for that is 11 is not true here.

165
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,470
11 is not true here.

166
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:37,540
That's why this F statement as F block is not going to run the else block runs and the S block is going

167
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,670
to grab the count and it is going to make it zero.

168
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,410
So.

169
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:50,080
Voila, the count is zero, and each time this is incremented, the gauge with which comes from here

170
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,450
is going to incremented by the same number because we multiply it by the same count.

171
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:02,530
So one times 80 pixels, two times 80 pixels, four times, five times eight pixels, six times, seven

172
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,290
times, eight times eight pixels, 10 times eight pixels.

173
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,480
We are going to get eight hundred pixels.

174
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,230
That's how simple it is.

175
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,110
That's it.

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,790
Well, not actually not.

177
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,210
That's it.

178
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm just going to add another because this code is very ugly sitting right here.

179
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,980
Why don't we add that to the start Kawase function?

180
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,010
This is where everything comes together.

181
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,240
So we are going to create I promise you, this is going to be the final function.

182
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,810
So we are going to grab or we are going to create a start Cui's function.

183
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,910
And what is it?

184
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,930
What is the Starquest function, the Starquest function as the event that is going to run whenever we

185
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,730
kaleck, whenever we click on the start are right.

186
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,300
So this is very, very, very cool stuff.

187
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,100
So start.

188
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,860
Colwin's.

189
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,860
And what do we want to do in here?

190
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:03,100
Basically, we just want to grab everything and put it right here and now, this function should be

191
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,140
called somewhere to be to run.

192
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:05,820
All right.

193
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,980
So what I'm going to do, I promise, this is the last thing.

194
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,040
I'm going to grab and I'm going to start.

195
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:22,100
What is that weird start button, start button event less tender.

196
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,310
I always write it the way it is.

197
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,580
I was whenever I want to write something, I just spell it the way I just pronounce it the way it is

198
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,910
written.

199
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,030
So it says listener, but it actually written listner.

200
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,760
That's how if English is your second language, you're not going to make any mistake.

201
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,150
But just make sure to keep it in you, to keep it to yourself.

202
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,540
Don't say it out loud or other people are going to look at you.

203
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,740
Very weird.

204
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,880
All right.

205
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,930
So let's say start with so everything should work perfectly fine.

206
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,390
So this is our application.

207
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,040
So whenever I click on this, Starquest, you're going to start our quiz.

208
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,110
The counter is starting, but the questions are not going to switch.

209
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,980
So we are going to wait for it until it hits 10.

210
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,920
Boom, it starts from zero once more.

211
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,970
All right, so we are getting close.

212
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,040
So now the interface is starting to work.

213
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,220
That's it for this lecture.

214
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,890
See you guys in the next one.
