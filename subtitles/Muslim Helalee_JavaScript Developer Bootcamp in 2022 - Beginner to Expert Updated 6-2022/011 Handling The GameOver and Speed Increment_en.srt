00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,570
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,140
In this lecture, we will handle the game over and the speed multiplication.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:18,020
All right, so first things first that made me collapse all these functions, so there is none of them

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,860
open here.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,540
Because they take a lot of space.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:32,299
So first things first in here, what I would like to do is I want to add a game over conditional and

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,860
I'm going to add their.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:41,450
So it is going to be the game over conditional, so just just game over.

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,180
So if the game.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:52,120
If the game over is not true, it means that the game is not over, then I would like to call all these

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,810
functions.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,720
So let's grab all of them and let's put them there.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,570
Let's see if the game over is true.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,370
We do not want to call all of them.

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,910
We just want to say, like, game over and that's it, right.

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,590
And right after that.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:17,580
Let's go over the drawing, drawing the game over, right, and that is going to be handled by our draw

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,880
text function.

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,040
So in here, right beneath everything.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,700
OK, I'm going to say drawing the just destroying game over.

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,310
So if game over is true, so if game over is true, what it is that we want to do.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,220
First off, we need to decide which text, if the game is over, which text do we want to show?

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,220
We want to show the text of when or the text of the game over.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,860
So for that, I'm going to say let text.

25
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:01,120
We are going to say if when is true, we are going to show the text when, if, if, when is false,

26
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,600
we are going to show the text of game over.

27
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,520
Is that.

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,150
There we go.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
We will be testing this as well.

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,890
So don't worry about it.

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,390
And just in just a moment and in here, we are going to grab our context.

32
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,480
We're going to say Phonte, and it's something like this.

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,210
So I'm just going to copy it from here and I'm going to put it right here.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,000
So it is going to be these text size times, too.

35
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,400
So a little bit bigger of a text.

36
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,800
Then we will have our text, a line of center.

37
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,820
We want it to be in the center of the page horizontally.

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,190
And now we're is actually the position.

39
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,790
So we are going to say context fell.

40
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,290
Phil text.

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,300
So what is going to be the text, the strength, it is going to be text that we have specified up there,

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,490
what what is going to be the exposition?

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,100
The exposition is going to be right in the middle of the page horizontally.

44
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,510
So that's where we've put it.

45
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,100
So we want it to be on top of the panel.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,840
So why am I going there?

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:27,340
So if I come here, if I had the ball, if I leave it to go down, if I had it one more time, leave

48
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,210
it to go down.

49
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,270
You can see that this is this is game over and I exactly wanted to be right here.

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,810
So the horizontal part is taken care of.

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,380
The vertical is going to be on top of the paddle.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,690
So the paddles y position minus the text size times, too, right.

53
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,800
So that's the position.

54
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,060
And the width is going to be Max with.

55
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,790
Perfect.

56
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:04,040
Let's save it and I don't think we we are going to be able to see it, so let's wait for it.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,170
And Ms.

58
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,670
Let's just leave it.

59
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,530
Let's see what we get.

60
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,120
There we go.

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,610
We can see this is now this is game over.

62
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,670
When the game is over, you can see that we get the game over text and the breaks.

63
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,110
They stayed the same way.

64
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:32,180
We do not want to recreate the bricks, but when you hit space, you can see that it is not like calling

65
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,650
or serving another game.

66
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,420
So there is no way to actually.

67
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:43,730
But for the final application when you had space, you're going to get another excuse me, another round

68
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,170
of like play.

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
All right, so.

70
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,000
We got that as well out of the way, so there it is, our game over.

71
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:07,040
So what I would like to do next is let's go ahead and let's actually be able to press, enter and see

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,030
something happen.

73
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,890
So what I would like to do is, first off, I want to go to my key down event.

74
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,610
So in here we have a key of 32.

75
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,620
This is going to be the space responsible for serving the ball after checking after running disserve

76
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,460
ball function.

77
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,040
I would love to check if game over is true, then called the new game function.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,280
So now we should be able to do something here.

79
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,640
So let me go over there, Servet, again.

80
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,300
And servlet again.

81
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,880
There we go, and now when I press space, it's just started a new game for us, so that is done there

82
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,390
as well.

83
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,150
We need to implement the same thing for the touch as well.

84
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,370
We shouldn't forget that.

85
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,360
So I'm going to go to my touch starts.

86
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,410
So that is complete.

87
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,500
Where have we?

88
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,550
OK, so they're right here.

89
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,570
So in the touch start when the ball is served, it says that the ball is served.

90
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,160
All right.

91
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:24,830
So in here in our touch start, instead of doing a console log, what I'm going to do is I'm going to

92
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,360
check for game over.

93
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,000
And if it is game over, then we would like to call a new game.

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,540
OK, so we should probably go ahead and test this as well.

95
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:49,990
All right, so in here, what I would like to do is I'm going to go to the mobile and I'm going to click

96
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,380
here.

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,140
Let's reload the page.

98
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,150
Why is it not working?

99
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,530
That's open up a life server one more time and let's check it out there.

100
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,310
So in here, let's go to the responsive design mode.

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,220
O Touch simulation is off.

102
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,800
So if I click, it should serve the ball.

103
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,150
When it doesn't, it doesn't even move.

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,110
I don't know what the problem is.

105
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,480
There is no problem here.

106
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,850
So.

107
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
Oh, there we go.

108
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,040
It just required so that was the first one you can see that the score is being updated as well.

109
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,950
So let's put it to something that is better visible.

110
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,310
So like maybe iPhone six, seven, eight, click, let's move away.

111
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,230
We have two lives are lost.

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,820
One, life is lost and we have two remaining.

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,100
Perfect.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,480
And then the final one remaining.

115
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,410
There we go.

116
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,660
It says, game over and when I click, it is going to create it is going to call the new game function

117
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,190
perfect.

118
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,410
So it is working in the mobile as well.

119
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:17,830
Next up, what we would like to do is let's go ahead and let's count the we have created this variable,

120
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,550
haven't we?

121
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:27,400
It is the number six, right, so it is going to give us the number of bricks that we have.

122
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,920
So what I what I would like to do is inside our create bricks function.

123
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,530
So let's go to the create bricks function.

124
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,780
And in here, I would like to find out the number of bricks that we are dealing with.

125
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,770
Right.

126
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,550
And down here I'm going to say no bricks.

127
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,980
So the number of bricks is going to be equal to.

128
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,280
Our columns times rose.

129
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,650
So that is going to give us the number of bricks and then we are going to reduce our number of bricks

130
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,330
by one.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,840
All right.

132
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,200
Each time the user destroys one of them.

133
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,890
So inside our update, bricks function down here.

134
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:23,850
Close that update, Brooks function, what I would like to do is we are going to grab our SO right after

135
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,660
here in here, what I would like to do is I want to grab our bricks and I'm going to subtract it by

136
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,970
one each time the ball hits it.

137
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:42,270
And I think you saw whenever the ball hit it, it it destroyed more than one brick at one hit.

138
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,110
But we want to destroy only one brick when there is one hit.

139
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,390
And that's basically what we are doing here.

140
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,080
All right, so we are we also would like to test for the next level.

141
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:05,840
So what I'm going to do is inside the same function, I'm going to create an if statement and we are

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,940
going to level up as well.

143
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,020
Whenever the user destroys all the bricks, we have to level up.

144
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,780
So where should I put this statement?

145
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:24,920
So out of this loop in here, I'm going to say test for a for the next level.

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,260
For the next level.

147
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,250
Now, we know that this is not we don't have an index level.

148
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,170
And I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to increase the speed of the ball to maybe like seven five

149
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,520
and I'm going to decrease the brick columns to.

150
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,960
Two, one, only, just one, so let's save it.

151
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,840
So if I if I click on it now, you can see that we only have one column.

152
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:59,970
And if I try to destroy all of the breaks in that one column, let's see if we go ahead.

153
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,070
If we go to a next call.

154
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,120
A next level.

155
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,840
You can see that and you can see here that even though all of the bricks are destroyed, we are not

156
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,150
going to the next level.

157
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,170
So we need we need to go to the next level whenever I'm going to keep it of this.

158
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
But then we are going to change it back.

159
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,660
So in here, we should test for the next level f the number of bricks is equal to zero.

160
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,430
What what is it that we want to do?

161
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,400
We want to check if the level first stuff we need to check if we are not already at the maximum level,

162
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,780
if the level is less than the maximum level.

163
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,960
Right, then we are going to grab our level and incremented by one and we are going to call the new

164
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,180
level function as well here, and you can see how handy these functions can get.

165
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:03,730
All right, and else and what is the asking to do when we are when the number of Bruxner, both of these

166
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,000
conditions are only going to apply when the number of bricks are equal to zero?

167
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,610
We don't have any more bricks.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,460
So if the level is less than the maximum level, we are going to increment it by one.

169
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:24,640
If the level is going to be either equal to or above that, that is going to be the LS when it is not

170
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,180
less than the maximum level.

171
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,260
So it is either equal to that.

172
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:37,210
Then we are going to show the game over or and we have to say the when whoever has and we have to say

173
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:43,300
that the win is true as well and the user has won and then we are going to call in Dinubile function.

174
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,570
So with this.

175
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,910
All right, so what I'm going to do, as if we go off to our draw text function.

176
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,520
Here we go.

177
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,060
We have already drawn the game over is true.

178
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,430
What do we want to do if when is true?

179
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,810
We are going to show this text.

180
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,670
If it is not, we are going to show this text.

181
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,010
We have done all of this.

182
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,770
Now we need to test everything.

183
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,120
So for us to be able to test it better, I'm going to grab the minimum balance angle and I'm going to

184
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,230
set it to 90.

185
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,930
So it's always going to go 90, hopefully.

186
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,660
And now let's set it so 90.

187
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,290
There we go.

188
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,190
I don't have to, like, switch to right and left go.

189
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,400
I don't have to move this anymore.

190
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,820
Now, let's see.

191
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:38,020
Now we are clearing everything so we should see a win is true and we should see the win text.

192
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,330
Now you can see that we went to the next level.

193
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,480
So this is level one that was zero and this is level one.

194
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:54,390
Now, if we go ahead and destroy all the breaks we should get, let me put it to one, we should get

195
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,300
OK.

196
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,640
So now this is level zero.

197
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,530
We should get a taste of when.

198
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,060
And I'm going to check for that.

199
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,430
It is going to take some time, of course, but you know what?

200
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,590
Let's go ahead and let's decrease the number of rows to one.

201
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,070
So we are only going to have one row.

202
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,970
So and in the next one, of course, we are going to have to rush.

203
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,560
This is level three already perfect.

204
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,310
There we go.

205
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,190
I could do something else if I don't know if that is possible.

206
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,380
I'm just going to put it to five ball speed, because if you increase it, like, a lot, then then

207
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,800
the frame the frame per second is not going to handle it.

208
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,080
And the ball is just going to go straight through the panel, OK?

209
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:55,280
And that is in there, you see, this is it's going to be jumping because the screen refresh rate cannot

210
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,850
handle it.

211
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,460
So I'm just going to put it to that, the column and I guess you could fast forward and from now on,

212
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,070
I'm just going to leave it so it does its work.

213
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,860
And you could fast forward.

214
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:22,880
Or or just as a as I thought, I can decrease the number of levels, so the maximum level is going to

215
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
be like, let's say two.

216
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,660
If I do that, that is going to decrease it as well.

217
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,830
What did we did the max level to perfect?

218
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,280
So.

219
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:44,040
Everything is bigger and you one see, so we get the new one text and losing should be easier than winning.

220
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,370
It always is.

221
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,560
So if I just move away, just do that.

222
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,190
Move away.

223
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,630
That's one loss.

224
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,430
Two losses.

225
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:02,770
And three losses, we get the game over perfect, so everything seems to work perfectly fine, we are

226
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,240
going to set it to 14.

227
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,360
We are going to set the ball speed zero point four or five.

228
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:17,970
So we have successfully implemented the game over and the game, what was then the other one, the game

229
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,670
when we have implemented both of them.

230
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,440
All right.

231
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:29,130
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a constant and I'm going to call it both speed, max,

232
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,040
ball speed.

233
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,870
OK, this should be capital and Max.

234
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,960
And I'm going to set it to two.

235
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,570
And this is going to be the ball speed.

236
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,230
Max is going to be a multiple of the starting speed.

237
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:57,060
So now what we are going to do is we are going to go to our we have create I think we have created that

238
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
in our class.

239
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:05,190
So in the ball now, in the break, I think, yeah, we have our speed multiplier.

240
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,380
We already have created it.

241
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:15,660
But what I would like to do is because whenever we hit any of any row of the breaks, any higher ranking

242
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,790
row of the breaks, we are going to get a speed multiplication.

243
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,020
So for that, what I would like to do is let's go to our create bricks function.

244
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,839
So let's clops that one.

245
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,660
This is draw text.

246
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:37,680
This should be the create bricks function inside our create bricks function.

247
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,910
All right.

248
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:46,130
So what I would like to do were should we put it I'm going to put it right here in here.

249
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:54,090
What I would like to do is I'm going to say speed is speed, multispeed mount.

250
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,990
And you can see that we have already passed it inside the brick.

251
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,270
And we are going to and now we are going to set it.

252
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,190
So we are going to one plus.

253
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:14,080
Rank high minus the rank, right, and we are going to divide this by the rank high.

254
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:24,140
Also, we are going to let's put this entire thing inside parentheses, oh, not this one as well.

255
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:31,310
And we are going to multiply this by the ball speed, Max, minus one.

256
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,440
Now, what does this mean?

257
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,960
It means that I'm going to I'm going to create a comment here so you can really understand what this

258
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,330
means.

259
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,600
So I'm going to say that the red rank is going to be equal to zero.

260
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,860
Then we are going to have the orange, yeah, the second one is orange, the orange rank is going to

261
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,460
be one.

262
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:01,710
Then we have the yellow, the yellow rank is going to be equal to Sweida, provide rank.

263
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
It is going to be equal to two.

264
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:13,710
It's let us reduce the space there, and finally, the green rank is going to be three and you know

265
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,260
that, right?

266
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:22,230
So as we come down the ranks, they get higher and the rank high is going to be equal to three.

267
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,140
So it is going to be three for our first level.

268
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,620
As the levels they keep progressing, the rank is going to get higher.

269
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:38,210
So we say that if the let's say for the green, what is the speed that we are going to have the speed

270
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,300
and speed if I pass through here for the Ranchi, what is the rank?

271
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,110
The rank is three.

272
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,050
So three minus three, we are going to get zero zero divided by rank, high zero divided by anything

273
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:57,060
is going to be zero and zero multiplied by the max ball speed is going to be zero.

274
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,560
So we are going to have one plus zero.

275
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,320
Basically we are going to have one and one times the speed, the current speed that we have, which

276
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,270
is zero point five.

277
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,930
We are just going to get what we are going to get zero point four five.

278
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,470
Right.

279
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,160
So for the green, we do not change the speed.

280
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,290
It is going to be a multiplier of one.

281
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,190
What about the yellow?

282
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,120
So if I put yellow here, that is the rank.

283
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,310
The high rank is three three minus two.

284
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,800
That is one one divided by the higher rank, which is three.

285
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,910
Right.

286
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,540
And that is like three minus two.

287
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,280
That is one one divided by three.

288
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,900
We are going to get zero point three three and then we multiplied by this, which is one.

289
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,200
So we are going to get one plus zero point three three.

290
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,490
So for this we are just increasing the speed by zero point three three.

291
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,430
Right.

292
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,800
Very like by 30 percent of that.

293
00:20:53,030 --> 00:21:01,520
So if the speed is 300 originally, we are going to incremented by almost 100 because 100 is almost

294
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,170
one third of that.

295
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,430
Right.

296
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:11,190
So you can see that here we have it is these are like very it's not like very fixed numbers.

297
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,690
So we have three hundred and thirty seven.

298
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,280
Our initial speed, the second speed is going to be 450.

299
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,050
So let's go ahead and let's grab our calculator.

300
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:27,390
And in here I'm going to say 450 minus three, thirty seven point five, we get one twelve.

301
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,330
So three three seven one 12 100.

302
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,870
How much.

303
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,460
So I'm going to multiply this by 100 and then I'm going to divide it by three thirty seven point five.

304
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,950
So you can see that we get thirty three point three percent of that.

305
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,550
I just did the ratio and that is very simple.

306
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,610
We have done it a lot.

307
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,490
So each time the speed is going to get increased by thirty three point three percent from one rank to

308
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,290
the next rung in case it is level one, otherwise the speed is going to adjust itself.

309
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,300
We are just providing it with a mathematical operation so it can do the rest itself.

310
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,170
We don't want to worry about it anymore.

311
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,630
So now that that is done, let's go to our update.

312
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,680
Bricks function.

313
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,790
So which is way down here.

314
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,060
Update bricks function.

315
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,610
And in here right after the update score, what I would like to do is I'm going to grab the ball and

316
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,510
I'm going to call a method which is set speed.

317
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:34,100
And I'm going to pass in our bricks, whichever brick that is, and from there we are going to grab

318
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,230
the speed that you can see how all of these methods are interconnected.

319
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:50,300
After we have created that, we should go to our ball class and actually set this function, so let's

320
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,620
come down here, where's our ball class?

321
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,100
It is right here and down below.

322
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm going to say set speed and this is going to be an Arab function.

323
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,560
Because it has an argument you are going to pass in a parameter, and that is speed.

324
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,200
So what do we want this to do?

325
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,870
We want this first off, let's grab this start speed, which is right here.

326
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,360
Right.

327
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,160
So we are going to say this, that speed is going to be equal to the max math that Max.

328
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:30,590
So the max function is going to return the larger of a set of supplied numeric expressions.

329
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:38,140
So I'm going to pass in two arguments in here and the math that Max is going to return the biggest of

330
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,640
those and it is going to set it to this speed.

331
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:42,720
Right.

332
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,960
So the first one is going to be the speed, the current speed that we have.

333
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,730
The second one is going to be that speed multiplier.

334
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:59,950
So ball underscore speed times the height, because whenever the height is getting smaller, the speed

335
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,120
is going to get slower.

336
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,760
If the height is getting bigger because we have more distance, we are going to increase the speed so

337
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,090
that distance is covered faster.

338
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:17,840
Very simple stuff, and now what I would like to do at this point is I want to log it to the council

339
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,810
as well so we can see it.

340
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:27,440
So I'm going to say speed equal to dollar sign curly braces this start speed.

341
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,210
In both cases, this speed is going to decide a speed.

342
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,960
But what this Max Max is going to do is if this is bigger than this, speed is going to be equal to

343
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,940
this speed, if this part is bigger than this, speed is going to be equal to this one.

344
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,700
Right.

345
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,970
And in here, what what we what we are going to do is we are going to play through the next level.

346
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,470
So you can't really see what's happening here.

347
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,570
And after that, we are done here.

348
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,690
And in the next lecture, we will be implementing the audio.

349
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,320
Right.

350
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,040
So this is where we are.

351
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,890
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to play that.

352
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,610
So let's see, we get three thirty seven point five in case you get a different number.

353
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:20,590
Well, I'm expecting that you have to get a different number because the screen height is different

354
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,630
for you and for me.

355
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,930
For me, it is.

356
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,900
This is a you you should screen.

357
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,720
So it is seven thirty something and the width is different as well, which shouldn't matter.

358
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,690
But if the height, if you get any number, which is not this or this, you shouldn't, you shouldn't

359
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,770
have to worry about it.

360
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:46,290
And in case you're wondering about this, why it is going just upwards, it is because that our bounce

361
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,730
angle is set to 90.

362
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,470
That is a good thing.

363
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,550
I'm not going to change it.

364
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,910
So you can see that our first rank, we had three three seven, then increase it by thirty three point

365
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,320
three percent, four fifty.

366
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,830
Increase it by thirty three point three, fifty five sixty two.

367
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,720
And then the maximum is going to be six seventy five.

368
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:14,400
So let's now go ahead and reduce the number of columns to one once more and let's check out the different

369
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,710
speeds that we are going to get.

370
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,780
I don't want to waste too much time.

371
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,200
So the first rank is three thirty seven, a multiplier of one.

372
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,890
The second rank is a multiplier of one point three three.

373
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,770
So we get four fifty, then we get one point six something, then we get 550 to.

374
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,570
And for this one we get six seventy five.

375
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,250
So now we are our in our next level.

376
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,840
So in here now, you can see that we still start, so the starting point is going to be the same and

377
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:52,270
the ending point, the range is going to be different because that speed multiplier, where did we added?

378
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:05,780
I'm sure we added here this dysfunction, this equation, this equation is going to take care of the

379
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,350
remaining rows, the extra rows that we are going to add.

380
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,800
All right.

381
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:16,550
When the level goes up so you can see that the starting is still three thirty seven.

382
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:23,420
The ending is still six, seven to five, even though in between the range is different because we have

383
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,220
an extra row.

384
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,270
And if I do it here as well, you can see that the starting at three three seven.

385
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:38,040
Each one has to be done two times because there are two rows in that specific rank, each rank has two

386
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:45,780
rows in it, you can see that we have different ones here and we have 540 because it has to count for

387
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,670
another rank that has been added.

388
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:56,350
And finally, we should yeah, there we go, we have our six seventy five, so this is how we set the

389
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,400
speed speed multiplier.

390
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,020
Let me put these back to 14 columns.

391
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,120
The bounce angle should be 30.

392
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,750
Let's save everything and everything should go back to normal.

393
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:15,970
And now you can see that as you go up, as the levels progress, it is going to get significantly difficult

394
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,590
for the user to play.

395
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,690
Even at the second and third level, especially in mobile devices.

396
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,240
It is going to be like pretty difficult for the users to play.

397
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,150
For example, at this level, you're going to get this.

398
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,390
So you have to really like run.

399
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,230
And there we go.

400
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,310
I'm just going to play it for a minute and embarrass myself.

401
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,840
So there we go.

402
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,510
Come on.

403
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,400
OK, let's try to keep up.

404
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,970
The bounce is real.

405
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,280
You can see that the speed is already at 360 389.

406
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,950
There we go.

407
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,870
It is going up.

408
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,200
Go up, go up.

409
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,350
It is.

410
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,460
The speed is four nine.

411
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,950
I was looking at the council.

412
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,780
That's why I lost it.

413
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,490
It's three, three seven, and there we go.

414
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,880
It is increasing.

415
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,680
Come on.

416
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,670
Oops, I lost it there, so you get the idea, you get the point what we are doing here.

417
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,810
So let me put it back to zero.

418
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,980
That's it for this lecture.

419
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,630
See you guys in the next one.
