00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,410
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create the superhero entry class.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:17,590
All right, so the way that I'm going to tackle this OLP project is we are going to create this application

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,420
in relatively shorter videos than we used to do.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,170
Like even I am going to try to keep it under five minutes.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,330
So they are, like, easily digestible.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,220
Right.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,320
So first things first.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,680
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create the superhero entry class.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,320
So what we are going to do as a general, what we are going to have is we are going to have three classes

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,030
and one is going to be for superhero entry, which is going to deal with our form.

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,730
The second one is going to be our superhero list, which is going to deal with the right part of the

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,980
screen where all the superheroes are listed and the third class is going to deal with local stories.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,360
But first, we are going to go over the first and the second class and all the methods.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,330
And at the end of this, towards the end of this chapter, we are going to implement the local stories.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,510
So to be able to create any class, we just ride the class keyword and the name of the class.

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,580
The difference is that the first character in that name should also be capitalized.

17
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,470
So we say superhero entry.

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,150
I'm just going to call it entry.

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,550
And in here we are going to have a constructor.

20
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:39,610
Now, the purpose of this constructor is whenever we call the superhero class and we pass in parameters,

21
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,220
those parameters are going to start arguments.

22
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,440
Those arguments are going to pass inside its constructors parameter.

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,240
Right.

24
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,970
So the first parameter, because this is entry, we are basically involved.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,210
We are basically working with three different parameters.

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,770
So one is going to be superhero name, superhero universe and then superhero power.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,460
So I'm just going to say superhero name and I'm going to say superhero universe and.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,210
Universe, and we are going to say superhero power, right, and in here, what we are going to do is

29
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:26,150
we are going to say this, that superhero name first one is name this that superhero name.

30
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,450
Why is it the smallest should be kept?

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,950
All right, so this one is going to be, when we say this, that superhero name should be equal to a

32
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,580
superhero name and we are going to do it for the other two as well.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,030
So this superhero universe is going to be a superhero universe.

34
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,600
And this that superhero name is going to be superhero power.

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,310
So now we have created our class for superhero entry.

36
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:05,120
And this what this class is going to do is going to grab the user entry, which is for superhero named

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,750
Super Hero Universe and superhero power.

38
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,720
OK, so the next class, the next class that I'm going to create is going to be the superhero list.

39
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,330
So super hero list list class.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,970
I'm just going to ride the class here as well.

41
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,720
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say class.

42
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,230
Let's capitalize the first word.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,430
So it's superhero and I'm going to call it list.

44
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,100
Right.

45
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,400
So what what do we have here?

46
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,270
And now inside here we are not going to have any constructor.

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,780
Right.

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,470
But inside here, we are going to have multiple methods.

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,570
So the methods for adding a superhero to the list, clearing superhero inputs when that list, when

50
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:05,480
the hero is has been added and validating the superhero for errors, the superhero form for errors,

51
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,010
validating the superhero form for success.

52
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:20,810
And basically we are going to implement all of these inside inside this class except for the local storage,

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,750
which is going to have a different class.

54
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:29,210
So everything that we will be doing inside this application will be added as methods are as functions

55
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,050
to this class.

56
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:36,520
And as far as Les is concerned, we are going to provide a different class for that.

57
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,000
That's it for this lecture.

58
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,620
See you guys in the next one.
