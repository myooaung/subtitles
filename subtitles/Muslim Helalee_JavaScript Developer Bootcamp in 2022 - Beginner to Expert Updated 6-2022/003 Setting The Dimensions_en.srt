00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,860
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,120
In this lecture, we are going to create the dimensions of the game.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:17,210
All right, so this is the very first real lecture in which we will start to create this game and first

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,410
things first, we have selected our canvas.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,360
Now there are some preset styling here, sort of preset code here.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,120
And I'm going to go over them and then we are going to jump into like actual actually writing code.

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,030
So we have selected our canvas.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,780
We have initialized the context.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,080
We have some game parameters we are going to add onto this.

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,570
So we have our grid circle, which is the circle size is a fraction of the cell size.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:50,640
Which is 70 percent of the cell size, that is the great service circle that you can see that the fraction

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,700
that is not highlighted, this wide space, that is the circle itself.

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,800
We have seven great columns, as in the original game, and we have six grid rows and the margin is

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,240
going to be zero point zero two.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,849
And we have some colors.

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,140
So the background color is going to be the color that you can see on the background.

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,340
Then we have our color for the frame.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,440
And so this is our frame that you can see the thing that's holding all the cells inside of that.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,670
That is the frame bottom that you can see there.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,470
We have the color for the eye, which is long green, and we have color for the eye, which is also

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,820
dark green.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,420
So if I select that, there we go with that green color, we have color for the array, which is orange

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,010
and color are dark, which you have not used yet, which is dark golden rod.

24
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,670
Right.

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,310
So the first thing that I want to do is I'm going to I'm going to be commenting this out because this

26
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,230
is a pretty extensive project.

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,560
We are going to have like many hundreds of lines.

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,840
So I will I will try to comment everything out to so nothing is confusing for you.

29
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,650
So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to create our dimensions.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,070
So it is dimensions, so set, dimension's.

31
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,580
OK, and there is not going to be any parameter, OK, so what is the width of the game?

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,120
The width is going to be the window dot and with.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,890
OK, so the height.

34
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,350
The height is going to be a window in our height.

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,820
What is the canvas elements with?

36
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,390
So we are going to say the canvas elements with is equal to the width and the canvas elements.

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,580
Height equals height, perfect.

38
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,440
So right after that, right, I'm going to do is I'm going to specify our margin as well.

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,950
So I'm going to say margin, OK?

40
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,390
The variables that we have on top there and I'm going to say math dot minimum.

41
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,740
Right.

42
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:14,740
So this the main method, what it is going to do is it is going to numeric expressions to be evaluated,

43
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,490
returns the smaller of a set of supplied numeric expressions.

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,150
So if you provide two values here, it is going to give you which whichever is smaller and I'm going

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:32,350
to pass in height and I'm going to pass in with this height and with this height.

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,360
It is coming from here and the width is coming from here.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,760
Right.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,160
And finally, after that, I'm going to create a function that is going to be called the new game,

49
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:49,790
the reason that we do this is because we we need to find out which orientation the pages in.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,790
So whether it is landscape, for example, in this case, its landscape, or is it a portrait in the

51
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,310
case of like mobile phones?

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,130
Right.

53
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,310
So right after this one, I'm going to do as I'm going to go on top here and I'm going to create the

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,260
new game function.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,670
Right.

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,660
And the new game function in here.

57
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,600
The only thing that I want to do is, OK, first off, let's create the function function, new game.

58
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,960
And in here, I just want to call the create grid function.

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,180
I know we have not created that grid function, but I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to call

60
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,960
that function.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,040
All right, so right after that, what I would like to do is I need to set some variables because we

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,290
need to keep track of the time difference.

63
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,910
For example, what is the current frame that is playing?

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,420
What is the next firm and what is the what was the last frame?

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,380
So we need all this because we need to create our game loop.

66
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,950
The game loop is going to grab our time difference.

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:08,780
Also, the last time, the time which was dedicated to the last frame, we are going to grab our request

68
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
animation frame.

69
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:15,590
And in here I'm going to pass in a function which in just a sec we are going to create and this is going

70
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,180
to be the game loop function.

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,070
So function play game.

72
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,310
And there is going to be a very parameter of time now.

73
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,190
So first off, let's initialize the time last.

74
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,360
So I'm going to comment at initialise time last.

75
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,150
All right, so if it is not the time last, then why did it what is it now?

76
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,170
First off, if the time last is not true, it means that the time time last, the term which was dedicated

77
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,560
for the previous frame, has not been specified.

78
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,970
What does that actually mean?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,290
It means that the game has not yet started.

80
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:04,540
So when the game has not yet started, we should specify the time last as the time now, because the

81
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,380
time now is actually the first frame of the game that is going to run.

82
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:16,090
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to calculate, calculate the time difference.

83
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,430
So I'm going to save time.

84
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,420
Diff is equal to the time now, minus the time last.

85
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,650
So time now, minus time last.

86
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:37,120
And because we want to find find them out in one second, I'm just going to divide it by 1000 milliseconds.

87
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,500
And this is going to give us seconds or seconds and seconds.

88
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,010
Right and right after that.

89
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:51,010
Now, whenever each of the frames each frames those 60 frames per second, each of the frames they pass

90
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,370
and the next frame comes for the next frame.

91
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,300
We always grab our time now and we set it two time last.

92
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,590
And then when that passes, that is going to become the time last.

93
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,690
And the next frame is going to be the time now.

94
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,590
So I'm going to say time last equal to time now.

95
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:10,980
Perfect.

96
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,280
All right.

97
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,030
And finally in this, I want to call our the next frame as well.

98
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:25,140
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say calling the next frame.

99
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,100
Right.

100
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,400
And for that, we are going to request information from and I'm going to pass in the game.

101
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,610
All right, so so far we have created the dimensions, the new game function, we have called the play

102
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,570
game function.

103
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,580
We have created our game loop.

104
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,450
Right.

105
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,260
And.

106
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,730
There is still a lot that we need to do now.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,700
The logic of this game works in this way that we need to do a lot of things for us.

108
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,860
So we so we are able to actually do something real with this game.

109
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:00,940
Right.

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,330
OK, so the next thing that I would like to do is I'm going to go on top of the set dimension's.

111
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,960
And I want to create were the background, because now I want to draw that background that we have and

112
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,890
then you know what?

113
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm actually going over this and we are first drawing the background, drawing the frame, the bottom

114
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,370
of the frame.

115
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,270
Then we are going to go over the dynamic.

116
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:33,400
Is the reason that we do all of this in JavaScript is because we actually don't don't want to do anything

117
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,169
in the demo.

118
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,500
You could draw that.

119
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,159
I guess you could do that, but I want to do it all, all the game.

120
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,080
I wanted to be drawn in JavaScript dynamically.

121
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,130
So let's go ahead and let's draw our background.

122
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,400
Drawback ground function, right, and in here, what I would like to do is let's first off create that

123
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,940
function.

124
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:04,590
Trah background, now, this function is going to have a canvas, context, canvas, context, art,

125
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,750
fair style.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,400
So what is going to be star?

127
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, we do not want a hard code, the film star.

128
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,690
So I'm just going to pass for now.

129
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,350
I'm going to pass and the color biji.

130
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,030
So this is going to be the background color and we are going to have a canvas context of fill in.

131
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,640
The background is going to be a rectangle.

132
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,590
That's why we say Felde Rect.

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,960
It's going to start from zero and and zero for the zero for the Y, and it's going to grab the width

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
and the height.

135
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,110
So if I say that and now let's open this up with life server, you should see something and I should

136
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,270
close this one because we're not working there.

137
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,170
We're working here.

138
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,420
So let's reload that.

139
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,480
And do we see I think it's very light.

140
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,990
OK, so if I come here, we have our color Viji, so let's see if we have specified that if nine.

141
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,730
If nine F nine.

142
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,160
Perfect.

143
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,370
We need to call that function as well, so that's why we don't see our color.

144
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,460
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to open up this one, this inspector.

145
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,760
I'm going to go into the console, OK?

146
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:23,480
Let's go ahead and let's create the create great function, let's define that as well.

147
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,150
So we we have created the grid function there.

148
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,980
We called it inside the new game.

149
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,350
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to call create that function as well so we can really see something

150
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,020
on the screen.

151
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,520
So this is going to be a way to create a grid function for a staff.

152
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,290
That's right.

153
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,390
The function name create grid.

154
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,310
And this grid is going to contain all of our roads.

155
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,550
This is an empty array.

156
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,210
You know, this is this is going to contain all of our roads and all of our columns.

157
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:04,500
So from now on, whenever I call this grid, what I actually mean is I am actually calling our entire,

158
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,090
like, layout of the game.

159
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:06,790
Right.

160
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,940
So first off, let's set the margins.

161
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:16,770
So I'm going to say set up cell size and margins.

162
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:17,790
Right.

163
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,890
So let's create this cell variable.

164
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,090
And I'm not going to give it any any value.

165
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm just going to say cell.

166
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,570
And then I'm going to create the margin X and I'm going to create the margin Y.

167
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,740
Perfect.

168
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,250
Now let's find out what is the orientation of the device or device orientation.

169
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:49,090
All right, so first, the first thing that we need to find out if the device in the port Rotarian station,

170
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,310
so f if the with so let's let me put that there.

171
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:05,410
So if the with minus margin safety with minus the margin that we have divided by two times the grade

172
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,050
rose, we just multiplied by the grid rows.

173
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,530
And I'm going to grab this entire thing and I'm going to divide it by the columns, by a number of columns

174
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,220
that we have.

175
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:27,150
OK, read columns, if this is less than the height minus the margin, the reason that we always subtract

176
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,840
the margin is we need to account for the margin as well.

177
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,500
Time, too.

178
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:39,000
If this is the case, then it means that the device is in the portrait orientation and then we are going

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,140
to grab the cell.

180
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:49,890
And basically we need to define the size of that cell because we we declared the cell, but we initialize

181
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,250
the cell.

182
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,530
But we did not declare it.

183
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,040
So in here, let's go ahead and let's declare it.

184
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,310
So each cell is going to have a size of the width times the margin because each cell also has a margin

185
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,360
times to.

186
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,730
And then we are going to divide that by the number of columns that we have, right.

187
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,640
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to grab our margin X as well, and we need to define

188
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:14,760
it.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,930
So the margin X in case this is portrait, it means like its upright, the margin X is going to be equal

190
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,030
to margin, but the margin Y is going to be the height of the cell that we have.

191
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:36,000
Margin Y is going to be the height of the cell, the height of the canvas or minus the cell size times

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,480
the grid.

193
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:43,290
So there we go, there is our grid rows and we are going to divide all of this by two.

194
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:52,920
So this is going to define for us if the device is portrait orientation or else, oops, let's put in

195
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,330
the comma device landscape.

196
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,620
Landscape orientation, orientation.

197
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:09,560
And I'm going to put passing the house here, so if it is the landscape orientation, what it is that

198
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,900
we are going to do differently.

199
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,600
So a landscape orientation is this orientation right here?

200
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,380
Right.

201
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,190
And in here, what we are going to do is in this portrait orientation, the cell size was the width

202
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,980
with times, the margin time, Stu.

203
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,390
But in the landscape orientation, the cell size is going to be the height minus the margin.

204
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,670
Time stood divided by the grid rows.

205
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,570
Right.

206
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,410
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to calculate that as well.

207
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,580
So height minus the margin for each of the cells, times two.

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,760
And in case you're wondering about these times, two for the margin, that's because the margin for

209
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,800
any cell, any cell has to sort of margins the margin left the margin right.

210
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,820
In this case of portrayed, what we have is margin left and margin right.

211
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,820
In the case of landscape, we have margin, top and margin.

212
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:08,660
But that's why when when we are talking about the margin, we always multiplied by two and then we are

213
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,300
going to divide it by the grid rows that we have.

214
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:11,990
Right.

215
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,670
So in the portrait, what we had was great columns, right.

216
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:23,870
Because the location is standing up, the orientation is standing up or upright, but in the landscape,

217
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,850
because it's like like like this, then we are going to have a grid rows.

218
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,570
OK, now let's specify the margin.

219
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,740
Now we know that for the margin, for the Latin, for the device portrait orientation, we had margin

220
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,940
X equal to margin.

221
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,220
But for this we are going to have margin Y equal to margin.

222
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,580
So I'm just going to pass it.

223
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,070
And what is going to be the margin X now, we know that we we need to two sort of margins, right?

224
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,290
And the margins are on the each side of the cell.

225
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,460
So if I come here so you can see in this in this this is landscape.

226
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,720
So the margin for this cell is going to be half of this margin and half of this margin.

227
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,970
So we need to divide that by two at the end of the day.

228
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,030
So let's grab our margin X and I'm going to say divided by two.

229
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,160
But what should be divided by two?

230
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:23,920
We need to grab the width of any cell and then multiply it by the number of cells that we have.

231
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,940
So this is the width of the cell that we have from here all the way to here.

232
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,000
And then we need to multiply it by the number of cells that we have in this case.

233
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,260
What is the number of cells?

234
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:40,130
It's actually the number of columns or column one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

235
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,010
So we need to multiply it by that.

236
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,210
But we need to subtract from the with the cell itself, because cell is a fraction of this entire circle.

237
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,610
So this is this the cell.

238
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,770
This entire thing is going to be the circle or our road that we have.

239
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:05,569
So we're going to grab the with and I'm just going to say minus the cell size that we have times the

240
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,540
entire number of great columns that we have there.

241
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,700
So how many great columns we have?

242
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,040
We have seven and it is going to multiplied by that.

243
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,010
Now, keep in mind, the reason that I'm not hard coding these great columns and grid rows is you might

244
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,780
want to change the number of columns and the number of grid rows you might want.

245
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,300
For example, like let's say you might want like 10 columns and like eight rows, for example.

246
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,620
Then you would have to come in here and you would have to change them dynamically as well.

247
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,760
The reason that we are passing it in is because these are dynamic values.

248
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,490
If you change them, there are going to be changed here as well.

249
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,450
All right.

250
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,590
So so far, we're not going to see anything and we will get to that as well.

251
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,350
So where are we?

252
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,630
We were right here.

253
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:57,570
So we said that if the with minus the margin on each of the sides times, the grid rows.

254
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,050
Right.

255
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,240
I'm just going to go over this concept one more time.

256
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:08,400
So our with we subtract it, subtract from the margin because the margin, when we subtract it, we

257
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,400
are going to get the width of that specific circle that we have times, the grid rows, how many rows

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,060
that we have.

259
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,810
We have one, two, three, four, five and six rows because this is a portrait we need to count up

260
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,370
when it is landscape.

261
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,530
We need to count from one side to the next.

262
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,580
So ports, right.

263
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,060
We need to count from the top towards the from the bottom, towards the top.

264
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,840
If the rows divided by the columns is less than the height.

265
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,820
It means the devices portrait in the portrait, the width is always less than the height.

266
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,330
Right.

267
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,880
But in the landscape, the height is less than the width.

268
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,690
OK, so this is landscape and landscape.

269
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,580
The screen size is 15, six by 720.

270
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,670
That's the landscape.

271
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,770
But if it was 720 by 1500, then that would be landscape, right?

272
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,080
Sorry, that would be a portrait for devices.

273
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,110
Our margin X is going to be simply the margin, but the margin why we have to subtract from a decent

274
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,550
size and the number of rows that we have because we are counting up.

275
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:23,050
We need when we are counting up, we have the number of Rosero one, then row two, three, four, five

276
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,740
and six.

277
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,740
And whenever we are in the landscape orientation, we need to count the number of columns that we have.

278
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,050
So this is landscape.

279
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,400
So one, two, three, four, five, six and seven.

280
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,570
That's why we have passed them right there.

281
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,910
That set for this lecture.

282
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,590
See you guys in the next one.
