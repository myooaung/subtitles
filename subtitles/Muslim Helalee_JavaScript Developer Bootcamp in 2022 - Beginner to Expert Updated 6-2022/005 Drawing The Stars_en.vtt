00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.920
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to draw our stars.

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.690
All right, so when it comes to drawing, drawing happens inside this game loop function, this is the

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.530
game look function.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.700
You either call another function here and in that function call you draw the stars, which I think we

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.350
are going to see in our next project.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.860
Or you just go ahead and straight up draw it in here.

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.940
I'm going to go ahead and straight up draw the stars in here.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.020
So drawing the stars, first things first, we need to say the color.

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.740
So the color is going to be I'm just going to say canvas context.

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.220
Now, this time we are going to set the color of the background or this full color of the circle.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.240
And I'm going to set it to Stars Color, OK?

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.510
We don't need quotes there.

13
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.610
So stars.

14
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.420
Stars color, so that's going to be our color and then what I want to do is I want to loop over that

15
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.800
because the reason that I'm looping over is because we are going to have different sizes.

16
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.800
We are going to have different locations and all that thing, because we have we have all this stuff

17
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.480
that we need to provide in here.

18
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.900
And also we have 1000 stars.

19
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.860
So we need to repeat either repeat ourselves 1000 times to create 1000 stars or just do a loop.

20
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.490
That's I mean, that's the whole ideology behind the loop to reduce our lines of code.

21
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.490
So it's going to start from zero and the loop variable is going to go all the way to stars number and

22
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.210
we're going to increment it by one each time.

23
00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:02.040
Now, first off, let's grab the let's say Biggin path started our path Grauer function, which is canvas,

24
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.190
grab the context and say, OK, here is where the magic happens.

25
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.180
So we are going to say,

26
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.910
excuse me, we are going to say now inside this arc, we have a horizontal position, right?

27
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.920
We have our vertical position.

28
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.540
We have a radius.

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.360
We have our stardate angle and ending angle.

30
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.610
So what is the horizontal position now?

31
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.320
The horizontal position?

32
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.950
You can see that it is horizontal position, but there is one little thing that you need to consider,

33
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.340
and that is that because this array, it has objects as items inside of that.

34
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.880
If you want to grab this property of the object, you need to call that array.

35
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.310
So we are going to call that array with Stars Eye.

36
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.930
And each time I'm just going to put it right here, each time we grab, each time this loop runs, we

37
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.360
are going to grab one item from this array.

38
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.750
And inside that item, we have a horizontal funnel.

39
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.460
You can see that we have access to that.

40
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.170
We have a horizontal position.

41
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.170
We are going to do the same thing for the vertical position.

42
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.690
What about a radius?

43
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.690
We are going to do the same thing for our star radius.

44
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.430
There it is.

45
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.690
Now, what is the starting angle?

46
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.590
Of course, zero.

47
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.090
What is the ending angle?

48
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.610
It is going to be math that pi because we want circle, we are just going to say multiply by two.

49
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.790
That's it.

50
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.590
So the final thing is we have we have provided the path.

51
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.690
We have provided the dimensions.

52
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.930
Right, but what about the what about the circle itself?

53
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.720
Now we need to provide it that we need to say that go ahead and grab all of these and filled that circle.

54
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.230
So you remember us with our lines that we had.

55
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.600
We had to actually draw the lines.

56
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:05.420
So for the fellow method, whenever you say Phil style, you just have to say, Phil, now, the stroke

57
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.800
is no longer going to work because we are not specifying the strokes style.

58
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.460
We are specifying the Phil's style.

59
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.210
So you need to call in the fall method.

60
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.910
Whenever you call the Phil method, it is going to create all these circles for us and the color for

61
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.320
those is going to be this color.

62
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.070
If I save it and if I come here and there we go, these are all of our circle, so so you can see they

63
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.890
have random location, random size, but they don't have a random velocity.

64
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.560
But that's what we are going to fix.

65
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.830
Right.

66
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.890
So you can see that I'm not closing this for a loop because everything must happen within that.

67
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.210
The next thing that I want to do is I'm going to say update stars horizontal position.

68
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.060
So stars horizontal position we want to update.

69
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.430
That means that we want to grab our stars and we want to apply the velocity to it so it can move in

70
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.690
the horizontal position when the speed plus direction, its velocity.

71
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.320
That's why.

72
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.820
So we grab our all of our stars array and we are going to say I from there, whenever you say I, when

73
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.680
this loop variable I iterates over the the array of stars, each time it iterates, it is going to grab

74
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.790
one object from that array and that object has certain properties inside of it.

75
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.450
What are those properties.

76
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.310
Those properties are right here.

77
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.570
Whenever you grab the object, all these properties are at your disposal to use.

78
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.970
So what property do we want to use when it comes to horizontal position?

79
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.580
We want to use the horizontal position property and we want to add it on.

80
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.830
Keep in mind, we do not want to override the previous velocity with the next velocity.

81
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.260
We want to add the previous velocity to the next velocity.

82
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.360
So again, let's grab the stars array.

83
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:05.670
And when we call it, we have also at our disposal these two velocities because they are within this

84
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.060
object.

85
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.020
I just explained it.

86
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.400
I'm not going to explain it again.

87
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.670
Then in that case, it would seem repetitious, repetitive, so horizontal horizontal velocity.

88
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.780
Now we do have our horizontal velocity, but we have something called the time.

89
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.290
I think this is the third time that I'm clear in my throat.

90
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.360
So let me just take a sip of tea.

91
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:39.100
All right, so we have hour time difference, and I'm going to multiply this velocity by the time difference.

92
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.760
That's why we created those, right?

93
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.250
And because the time difference is in milliseconds, we need to convert it.

94
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.730
So because it's in seconds, we need to convert it to milliseconds.

95
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.510
That's why I'm just going to multiply it by zero point.

96
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.310
Zero point zero zero one.

97
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.720
All right, and.

98
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.270
There we go.

99
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.500
So if the time difference is 10 and you multiply it by this, you're going to get what this is really

100
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.980
difficult.

101
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.720
So multiply it by by point one, you get zero point zero one.

102
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.110
So 10 seconds is actually zero point zero one.

103
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.060
OK, you know, I think I may have explained it the other way around.

104
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.440
So the time difference, because it is in milliseconds, we want to convert it into seconds.

105
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.170
So if it is 1000 milliseconds, so let me clear this up 1000 milliseconds.

106
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.830
If I multiply it by 0.01, we are going to get one second.

107
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.810
Yeah, it was that milliseconds convert to seconds already.

108
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.090
Right.

109
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.560
So we have done this and if I save it and if I come here.

110
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.340
There we go.

111
00:07:52.370 --> 00:08:00.020
Now here is the thing that I, I've been waiting so long to explain to you, and this is exactly what

112
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.810
it means by drawing a thing on the screen.

113
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.990
This is literally that.

114
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.400
So I'm going to zoom in for you.

115
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.520
For example, let's go ahead on this graph, something now.

116
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.010
You can see that these are faster fasters.

117
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.440
Let's refresh until they're slow.

118
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.910
So, for example, if I take into consideration this star, this star is moving from the left to the

119
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:32.900
right, but because our we are not clearing this canvas, the star is because it's moving from left

120
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.490
to right.

121
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:42.640
It's being redrawn after each time it has been redrawn on our screen, like motion picture, like animations.

122
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.910
You need to clear the screen so you can redraw it again.

123
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.860
We are not clearing the screen.

124
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.120
That's why you can see this.

125
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:57.080
Now, imagine if in movies a person is sitting, for example, on a on an a chair and the person is

126
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:05.180
standing up and moving to the other side of the room and you would see mirages or a mirage of that person

127
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.330
from that position that it's sitting.

128
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.980
He is sitting to the other side and you would see like 1000.

129
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:21.070
Different copies of that person and why don't you see that, why don't you see like 1000 different copies

130
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:21.660
of the person?

131
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:30.340
But in this case, we can see 1000 different copies of that specific star that we had because they clear

132
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.200
the screen and we do not.

133
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.090
Each time they redraw, they cleared the screen.

134
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.960
What what does it mean when the person stands up in the process?

135
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:46.480
There are 10 images of that person on the screen when it goes to the image.

136
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.900
Number two, it clears out image number one.

137
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:55.720
That's why you do not see that when it goes to image number 10, all the previous images have been removed,

138
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.690
have been cleared.

139
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.070
Now we need to do the same thing here.

140
00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.920
So.

141
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.870
What how can we do that?

142
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.260
Let's think about that as well.

143
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.760
I'm doing a lot of theory because this is the building blocks.

144
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.100
When we get to our games, I'm not going to be explaining everything in depth because that way discourse

145
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.900
would get to like 200 hours.

146
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:22.300
I'm explaining it here because this is a simpler project and these ideas are better digestible, as

147
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.420
we would like to call it.

148
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.280
So what is the thing that is happening over and over and over and over?

149
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.050
That is this run stories.

150
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.500
And when this is happening 60 times a second, it means that we want to remove we want to clear the

151
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.490
screen how many times a second, 59 times a second.

152
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.310
Because the last one is the thing.

153
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:48.280
The last redrawing is the thing that we want to show to the user.

154
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.810
So how can we clear the screen 59 times a second?

155
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.980
So I'm going to say canvas.

156
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.310
There is another cool method that is available to us and that is clear.

157
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.110
Come on.

158
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.170
Clear, direct.

159
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.700
And it is going to get graph for prime arguments.

160
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.140
One, the position position zero exposition zero.

161
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.860
Why now the X and Y are going to be the same and then the canvas dimensions, the canvas dimension is

162
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.970
canvas element dot.

163
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:27.170
The first one is going to be with the same way that we that we drew rectangles first we had with and

164
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:33.860
then we had height the same way that we had four circles first we had with and then we had enough for

165
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.250
soccer.

166
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.080
We had a position.

167
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.840
So first we have with and then we have canvas start.

168
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.800
Now when I save it, you're going to see the stars being moved.

169
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.360
And this is the cool thing.

170
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.950
Now, there are a few problems here that the stars are being finished.

171
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.080
They're not being redrawn again here.

172
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.090
After the frame is being is being done, you can see that the stars and we are going to fix that.

173
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.960
Don't worry about that.

174
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.850
OK, but the cool thing is that the star is actually moving.

175
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.430
But we know under the hood the star is being redrawn thousands of times.

176
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:18.590
And after it has been redrawn in the next frame, all the previous frames are being cleared, that's

177
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:19.640
what we did here.

178
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.620
That's how motion picture works.

179
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.080
That's how all the animations, all the animations, I'm not going to call anyone.

180
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.920
I'm not going to say the name of any animations, but all the animations that you see on TV that you

181
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.980
see that go to cinemas like movie theaters, everything that you see on the screen, that's how it works.

182
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.890
And this is how it works in the world of JavaScript.

183
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.970
The idea is the same.

184
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.790
The implementation is different.

185
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.320
This is how it works in JavaScript world.

186
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.040
Right.

187
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.480
So we were able to do all this cool stuff.

188
00:12:53.750 --> 00:13:00.290
Now, in the next lecture, what we are going to do is we are we want to whenever this starts, let

189
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.190
me refresh that.

190
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.820
Whenever this this starts, they move off the screen.

191
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.330
We want to redraw them in this part of the screen.

192
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.130
We want to not redraw them, reposition them to the other.

193
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:19.130
So any star that it's like Miss Pacman, if you have played it, if you go out of this side, you're

194
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.930
going to appear off the other side.

195
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.060
It's exactly like that.

196
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.470
We are going to do that.

197
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.520
That is one of the basic things that we have in game development.

198
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:34.460
If you go out if you go into the one side, for example, if you go inside the left, you're going to

199
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.800
be shown, you're going to come out of the right.

200
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.760
If you go towards the type, you're going to come from the bottom, you're going to appear from the

201
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.090
bottom.

202
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.710
So when they go to the left, we want them to be appeared from to the right.

203
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.280
From the right, if they go and vice versa.

204
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.470
If they go to the top, we want them to be appeared from the bottom and also vice versa.

205
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.750
So see you guys in the next one.
