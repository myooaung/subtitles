Hi, everyone, in this last year, we are going to go over resolving this in Arah functions Arri So

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.790
a common misconception is we didn't we tend to think that curly braces must be scope's, right?

3
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.910
Like in here we have curly braces set of curly braces here and they should be scope's, they are bloks

4
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.120
their function bodies and so they must be scope's.

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.380
Right.

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.820
So I'm going to ask you a question.

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.390
What is going to happen when I define an arrow function.

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.680
All right.

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.400
On line three, what is going to happen?

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.070
What is the this keyword going to point at?

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.540
What is the parent lexical scope from which that error function will go up one level to resolve that

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.560
this keyword?

13
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.810
Is it the movie shop?

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.370
No, it is the global scope.

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.540
Why is that?

16
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.000
It is not the movie shop object.

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.210
Because guess what?

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.599
Just because there are there are curly braces around that object doesn't make it a scope.

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.400
Objects are not scope's.

20
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.470
There are like literally hundreds of questions on stack overflow to this context where people are saying

21
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.330
why is the arrow function not getting my movie sharp as my context, for example.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.860
All right.

23
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:28.090
So because they think that curly braces are scopes, and when we want to resolve the this keyword inside

24
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.020
this arrow function lexically, this is going to travel one level up.

25
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.170
What is one level up then this that is the global of the global scale.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.250
We don't have any this defined inside the global.

27
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.260
We don't know what this movie is.

28
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.750
Where is this movie coming from?

29
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.350
We don't know what this movie is.

30
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.260
We don't have any object movie.

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.940
Right.

32
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.380
So we don't have it.

33
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.900
We we are going to get undefined.

34
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.560
It doesn't matter if you call that function OK, if you call that function using the context object

35
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.430
way.

36
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.550
If you call it like this, you are going to get undefined, I'm just going to zoom out of it so we can

37
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.210
see it better.

38
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.320
It is going to say undefined.

39
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.230
Can I make it bigger?

40
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.580
Yeah, I like that.

41
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.370
It is going to give us undefined and if we go ahead and use the call method, so even if we use the

42
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.370
implicit binding or if you use the call method.

43
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.850
And if I save it, we are going to get undefined.

44
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.710
I'm just going to go ahead and make it bigger like that and we are going to go smaller screen.

45
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.900
All right.

46
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.040
And this is I'm going to go over this one more time.

47
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.620
It is because objects are not are not scope's until we find a letter or a concert declaration.

48
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.910
Right now, we have to think about a narrow function as not having a this and resolving it lexically

49
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.780
what is what does it mean lexically it is going to go one level up.

50
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.210
OK, so what is the parent scope?

51
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.810
There are only two scopes in this program.

52
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.410
The scope of the movie func, this scope and the global scope.

53
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.390
OK, so what is the scope that it is going to go one level up?

54
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.130
That is going to be the global scope and we don't have any any movie in the global scope.

55
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.630
We don't know what that this is going to point at.

56
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.660
OK, so it's because if we come here on the movie function, we can see that it points to the movie

57
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.070
shop, OK, but because are functions, they don't define a lexical this we are going to get undefined.

58
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.350
It doesn't matter if you even do a dart call on it.

59
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.580
And we pass in the movie shop as an argument for this because again, inside the movie shop we have

60
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.670
an arrow function and arrow functions don't define at this.

61
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.740
We need a proper function.

62
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.440
We cannot error functions.

63
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.600
So this is something that you need to keep in mind.

64
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.310
And we had in the in our previous lecture, we had a proper function in here, a named function.

65
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.600
All right.

66
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.690
As a method.

67
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.720
That's why we could, when we resolved it, lexically we were able to grab this this key word, what

68
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.660
it pointed at it pointed at this movie.

69
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.750
All right.

70
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.220
But in this case, we don't have a proper function and the error functions are not hardbound functions.

71
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.040
That's why they do not define this keyword, not set for this lecture.

72
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.680
See you guys in the next one.
