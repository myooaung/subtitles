00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,310
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to display recipes to the screen.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,750
All right, so before going forward, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab these items, this one,

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,770
this one and this one, and I'm going to common them out.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,740
Right, so let's cut them out, save it so we just click, you can see all of them are commented out

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,030
and if we come here now, we can see there is nothing here.

6
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,830
All right, so.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,130
Inside here, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to tag on and one more thing here.

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:43,840
So for that, for me to be able to show you what actually that is that I'm adding there, I'm going

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,140
to say console Dahlborg response data.

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,190
So we have our response data.

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,590
And from there we get the hits and from the hits, let's get the recipe.

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,820
So let's say that let's come here.

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,930
Let's say Salyut.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:08,040
And we get undefined recipe, right, so we get hits.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,340
Oh, so let's do let's save it.

16
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,290
Let's do salad one more time.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,790
Why did we get undefined?

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,230
The reason that we got undefined was because this recipe this is actually an object.

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,410
So in fact it is an array item.

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,570
So this array has 30 items and this is one of them.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,720
So we cannot just say recipe dot Rike response data hits the recipe.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,430
We need to loop over that.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,510
That's why we need a function.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,890
So I just wanted to show you that and now let's create our function.

25
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,250
So in this function.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,590
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a recipe element and this recipe element is going to be

27
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,890
the element that this.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:08,130
Recipe results is going to adopt, right so down here now, let's go over the recipe results and let's

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,120
loop over that loop over them recipe results.

30
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,350
So where is recipe a recipe results dot for each.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,420
And we are going to say, I'm just going to say recipe results or recipe.

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:39,650
Russ, recipe results, and we are going to run an arrow function, so each time we get a single results,

33
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,860
what do we want to do to it?

34
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,780
We want to add add on to this to this recipe element.

35
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,720
Now we want to add it on to it.

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,360
So we need to add a plus ecocide.

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,250
So a recipe element.

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:02,550
Recipe element, and we are going to say, plus equal and let's create our tactics now in here, I'm

39
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,490
not going to go over the trouble of creating the element.

40
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,080
We already have the structure for that element.

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,180
So I'm just going to grab it from here.

42
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,620
It doesn't matter whichever one you grab and it just go ahead and put it here and now make sure the

43
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,380
indentation is correct.

44
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,750
So grab all of these had a tab and these are indented perfectly.

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,800
All right.

46
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,950
So we have our image element and then diff and then add another perfect.

47
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,110
So what where is the source for that image?

48
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,030
I'm just going to remove this piece.

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,550
Where is the source for that image?

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,970
The source for the image is a recipe let's put in our tactics.

51
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:55,830
So I'm just going to put in the tactics and we are going to see inside them recipe results, dart recipe,

52
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,650
dot image.

53
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,850
So this is going to give us the image and then we need to grab the recipe title.

54
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,780
What is the recipe title we are going to say?

55
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,520
I'm just going to copy this line because it's repeated everywhere.

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,250
So that recipe dot label you remember, right?

57
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,990
Label, you know what?

58
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,850
I'm just going to copy this line.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,779
It's repeated.

60
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,690
So that's going to be the recipe title.

61
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,450
And for the view recipe, we are going to we are not going to change anything here, but we are going

62
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,650
to change the it's rough because that's what's responsible.

63
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,360
That's what's responsible for showing the actual recipe.

64
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,860
So let's put that here and then it is what you are.

65
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,430
But keep in mind, if you collect this, it is going to open within the same directory.

66
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,070
That's not something that we want.

67
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,970
So we are going to say target.

68
00:04:52,510 --> 00:05:00,790
Underscore blank, right, so that's that now let's come inside the recipe description, and we can't

69
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,470
we can grab our calories right and in front of the calories, I can create this.

70
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,900
So it is not calories.

71
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,950
Calories, right.

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:22,360
And then we have our diet label just put in this and it is diet labels.

73
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,410
Right.

74
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,840
And in front of this, we are going to get our health labels, health labels.

75
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:41,070
And finally, we get the sauce, so let's create this, put it here and sauce.

76
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,590
Now, we have created our aliment.

77
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,930
We need a parent to adopt this element.

78
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,430
And what is that parent?

79
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,540
That parent is going to be our search results.

80
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,700
So I'm going to come down here.

81
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,160
Now, keep in mind that you should be within this for each, because each time that this element is

82
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,030
being created, it is being adopted at the same time.

83
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,310
So we are going to say search results.

84
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,110
That inner HTML.

85
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,620
In our e-mails should be recipe.

86
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,590
Let's save it and let's check out our exchanges.

87
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,470
Let's see if there is any error so we can debug it or hopefully there shouldn't be anything.

88
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,120
So let's say solid saw it.

89
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,460
And after that, we do start solid.

90
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:36,720
We can see there is no error and we can see that there is one row, two, three, four, five, six,

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,930
seven, eight, nine and 10.

92
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,220
So we get 30.

93
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,600
Right.

94
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,490
But and let's check it out.

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:53,310
So if I click on this, we go to another page that is eating well, dot com and it is chicken salad,

96
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,660
stuffed tomatoes.

97
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,620
So stuffed chicken salad, stuffed tomatoes.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,570
And it's you can see that the health label is undefined and the dirth labels, it works, but the health

99
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,710
label is undefined.

100
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,570
And you can see that the calories is also like a large number.

101
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
So let's do something about that.

102
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,100
So first off, I'm going to say to fixed.

103
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:27,900
And we just need to two of them, right, two of the decimal points, so now if I search for solid,

104
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,890
we should only get two decimal points and we do.

105
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,630
But still, the health label is undefined.

106
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,680
Maybe it's a typo.

107
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,470
So health like labels?

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,600
Yes, it was a typo.

109
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,510
So let's save it.

110
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,070
Let's come here.

111
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,690
Let's check Salyut.

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,540
And we do get the health level as well, so some of them do have a diet level, they're both somewhat

113
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,620
don't have some of them do have.

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,290
So it's calories, low carb diet label, health label and source.

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,940
And when click on The View source, it is going to get you there.

116
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,300
Shrimp salad.

117
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
You can't search for anything.

118
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,910
Of course, we are done with this application, so all if.

119
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,180
All right, so we get Olive.

120
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,770
It's a little slower, but we do get that, so if we do figure.

121
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,620
For example, fake GM, perfect.

122
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,179
You can see that you are going to get a recipes to be able to create cheese.

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,610
What is that fig jam?

124
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,010
Or you can just go ahead and grab that.

125
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,770
I don't know what's now loading the images.

126
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,220
It should load that.

127
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,740
So.

128
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,970
So bring this up to the console, some messages, let's go to the network, I'm just going to detach

129
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,210
it.

130
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,050
And inside the network.

131
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,180
You know, it's like on this one and then.

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
It's blocking some things, nine coquis.

133
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,420
All right, so inside the network.

134
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:32,980
Let's do fig jam until one more time, and now we get that if I click on it, it says the method is

135
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,770
status code is 200.

136
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,960
This is the method and it is coming from that.

137
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,550
Our API request.

138
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,800
You can see that it's exactly the same thing that we have inserted.

139
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,260
And this is a query fig jam.

140
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,270
And this is the response that we get headers and a lot of different stuff.

141
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,110
And this is our object, right?

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,670
30 inside of it.

143
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,200
So we get the recipe URL.

144
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,850
This is the arrow sorry array.

145
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,920
This is the object itself.

146
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,300
And inside there we get all these different.

147
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,340
So you can go ahead and grab any of the information that you want.

148
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,310
For example, ingredients, ingredient lines and yields.

149
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,240
You are I and a total wait.

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,410
Total time.

151
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,490
What else.

152
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,740
Total daily.

153
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:36,340
You can see that this is a massive API zenk, it's got this many in this person, Zenk, what is that?

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
This is vitamin K, vitamin D, vitamin B 12.

155
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,320
So it gives you the nutritional facts nor nutrition facts as well.

156
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,790
So it should be calcium then.

157
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,290
We have energy.

158
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:56,340
Kalari This is you can paste these so you can put these to the use for the user as well.

159
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,520
And that is when you want to create like a very, very extensive application.

160
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,190
What is this beer?

161
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,150
Can roasted chicken affect jam source?

162
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:06,890
We are.

163
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,720
All right.

164
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,370
So that's going to be it for this lecture and this chapter.

165
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,130
See you guys in the next one.
