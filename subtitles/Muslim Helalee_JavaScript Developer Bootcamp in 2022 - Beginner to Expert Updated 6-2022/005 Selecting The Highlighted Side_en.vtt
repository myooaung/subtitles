00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.440
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.340
In this letter, we will be selecting the highlighted site.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.220
All right, so what are we going to do as first off, let's create the event for that.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.340
And that is going to be the click event listener, E-L.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.320
And it is going to be within the territory of canvas, so out of one listener, we will be listening

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.770
for a click and then we will be running a click function.

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.930
All right.

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.230
So where should we put this click function?

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.820
I'm going to put it right after our Kloster play game, our the our game loop.

10
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.430
So it is going to be the click function.

11
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.900
Right, and what do we want to do in here?

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.470
So it's basically the same thing that we're.

13
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.950
Where did we do that?

14
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
Basically this if time end is greater than zero, we want to return.

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.840
If the game has finished, we don't want to be able to click.

16
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.129
Right.

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.890
So first off, let's check for that, so I'm going to pass in our event object as well.

18
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.480
I just want to yeah, we have passed the event here as well, so let's passing the event object.

19
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.610
For this event, that's passant our condition, and that is going to be let's copy this from here,

20
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.410
the same way that we do not want to highlight anything, we do not want to click on anything.

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.290
So next stop in here.

22
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.770
I just want to call a select side function, all right?

23
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.790
And I'm not going to pass in anything for that select site function.

24
00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.320
Next stop, let's go ahead into our new game function now for a new game function, where is our new

25
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.580
game?

26
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.470
So I'm going to collapse this one and also the highlighted side inside our new game functions.

27
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.560
I'm going to grab our current cell's array and I'm going to say I'm going to reset it or basically and

28
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.250
here we are initializing the current cell's array.

29
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.430
All right, and.

30
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.590
What I'm going to do as inside our highlight site, we before actually running the sluff, we need to

31
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.770
go ahead and we need to grab our current cells and we need to reset it their right.

32
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.630
And after that, we need to go ahead and we need to populate this current cells.

33
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.160
All right.

34
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.330
And for populating this, we know that we have our site, which is going to give us each side.

35
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.740
But before passing this site, we need to check that if if that site is not not so if that site is not

36
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.980
empty, then we are going to grab our current cells and we are going to say, Pusch what is it that

37
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.520
we want to push?

38
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.700
We want to push an object which which has a property of Roe with a value of AI and a property of call

39
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.200
with a value of J.

40
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.380
All right.

41
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.190
So basically we are pushing it there.

42
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.950
Now, let's go ahead and let's actually create the select side function.

43
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.870
OK, so I'm going to go here.

44
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.780
Let's copy this comment, oh, not cut it, just copy it, put it right here and we are going to say

45
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.330
select side.

46
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.620
Perfect.

47
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.060
So what do we want to do within the select side function?

48
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.320
First off, we need to check for something not we want to check a specific side if our current self

49
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.250
is not empty.

50
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.420
Right.

51
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.650
And if the current sells and either it doesn't have anything, we don't want to select that side.

52
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.850
So let's go ahead and let's actually see that in code.

53
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.350
That is that is going to make more sense.

54
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.500
So if the current sells is null.

55
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.390
Or the length is zero, so length is zero.

56
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.630
We don't want to do anything, we want to return from this function otherwise.

57
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.080
We want to select a specific site, so we are going to say select site.

58
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:43.490
Perfect, so inside here, let's go over let's let's loop over our current selves and for each cell

59
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.960
that we loop over that, we are going to select that side.

60
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.340
So we are going to say for that cell of current cells.

61
00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.880
Squares, let's grab our squares function, let's passan so for the road, we are going to have cell

62
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.960
Dutrow for the column or we are going to have cell dot column and what it is that we want to do, we

63
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.970
want to select the site.

64
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.300
Let's call Endi select site method in here.

65
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.100
After we have selected the site, we are going to go ahead and reset our current cells to an empty office,

66
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.400
to an empty array, right.

67
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.120
And.

68
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.160
What I'm going to do then is let's go ahead.

69
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:42.130
I don't think we have created this function, so we have dry side, we have dry sides, we have highlight's

70
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.880
side.

71
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.280
We don't have anything underneath that.

72
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.650
But we do need our select side.

73
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.990
So I'm just going to put it right here.

74
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.980
So this is what I meant by actually how to methods having the same name.

75
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.810
I couldn't come up with a better name.

76
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.960
So if you can go ahead and do it so you can see that this squares is actually a class.

77
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.660
And on this class, when we call in a function, that function should be within that within that class.

78
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.810
So when we call in that select side on the squares, it means that this squares the select side is within

79
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.370
the square.

80
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.360
So it shouldn't be confusing at all for you.

81
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.430
Let's come down here and I'm going to say select side.

82
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.060
Let's grab our good old arrow function.

83
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:38.200
And first off, let's go ahead and let's check if this if if the cell highlight is null, we want to

84
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.710
return.

85
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.860
It means we want to select a side only if if that is highlighted.

86
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.350
So return.

87
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.900
All right.

88
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.210
We want to we want to do basically that.

89
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.340
And now let's go ahead and let's select the highlighted set side.

90
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:03.070
I know I'm saying a lot of sides now, and this is going to be a switch as well, because we are checking

91
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.590
for either of the sites.

92
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:15.010
So this start highlight, the first case is going to be if this if side dot bottom not begin path,

93
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.430
side, dot bottom.

94
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.450
If it is the side bottom that has been highlighted, what do we want to do?

95
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.660
We want to select it.

96
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:34.060
So we want to say side bottom dot owner is no longer null, but it is the player's turn.

97
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:44.120
And also this dot side bottom dot selected is no longer false, but true because it has been selected.

98
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.260
So basically what we are doing here is we want to first check if that site is selected, highlighted,

99
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.910
if it is not highlighted.

100
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.450
We don't want to do anything in case it is highlighted.

101
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.690
We want to check which side it is and if it is Sidebottom, grab the bottom.

102
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.730
What about the other sites?

103
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.410
So for those, we need to provide cases as well.

104
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:15.670
So let me just provide space there, so if it is the left left, we want to grab the side.

105
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.350
Let me just grab this and control.

106
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.390
We want to grab the side left and the owner is going to be player, stern player.

107
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.850
And we are going to say that selected is true.

108
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.040
It means that it has been selected at this point for the right.

109
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.809
If it is right, we are going to grab the bottom and change it to.

110
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.350
Right.

111
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.480
All right.

112
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.220
And if it is tough, we are basically going to do the same thing.

113
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.400
We are going to say controlled top.

114
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.600
Perfect.

115
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:57.310
All right, so let's actually go now that we can select the side, we need to be able to draw that side

116
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.680
as well.

117
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:06.970
So within our draw sides function that we have just checked for, if it is highlighted and now we need

118
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.430
to actually draw that side.

119
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.050
So we are going to say f this that side bottom.

120
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.990
Dart selected, if it is true and we know it is true, why?

121
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.080
Because it has been highlighted.

122
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:22.990
It has been.

123
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.450
And in here we have said they selected to true.

124
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.310
If it is true, what do we want to do?

125
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.520
Of course we want to draw that side.

126
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:37.030
So we are going to say this stud draw side in mind, draw syeed singular.

127
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.960
It is going to be decided bottom.

128
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.580
And this side is going to grab which side it is and what is the color for that side?

129
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:56.640
So the color is going to be dependent on whether it is the player's turn or the computer's turn, a.k.a.

130
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.180
player one and players, too.

131
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.410
So we need to check for that as well.

132
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:08.550
So for for this, we are going to grab our get colored function and we are going to pass on this dart

133
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.220
side.

134
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.890
But bottom.

135
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:19.460
That owner, whichever owner that is, and the second parameter in here is going to be the light, you

136
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.460
can see that it says the second arguments are going to be light now that we are actually selecting the

137
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:25.940
site.

138
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.490
So you can see that when you hover on it, it is going to highlight it and it is light.

139
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.900
But when we select it, it is no longer light.

140
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.720
It is like that perfect solid color that we have.

141
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.850
So the light in this case is going to be false.

142
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.280
False.

143
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.500
All right, so we are we have done this now let's go ahead and let's repeat it three more times for

144
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.610
the other side's.

145
00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:02.860
So if this does Sidebottom, if this that side left, if it does decide left, we are going to grab

146
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.130
the side left in here.

147
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.380
I'm going to grab the side right.

148
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.590
And in here, I'm going to grab the side top.

149
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.480
And we are not going to change the owner, but just we are just going to go.

150
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:23.290
I'm just going to provide a comment here just to try to separate these conditions from each other.

151
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:32.160
And this should go a little bit further perfect, so Sidebottom, we are going to select this, draw

152
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:37.030
the Sidebottom, the color is going to be Sidebottom, that owner, and it is not going to be light

153
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.040
for this side left.

154
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.860
We are going to select the side lefts owner.

155
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.490
For this side, right?

156
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.850
We are going to scrub the side rights owner.

157
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:58.410
So right, and for this side, TARP, we are going to select this side Tatz owner.

158
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:08.690
All right, so so far, what we are going to do is we are actually drawing the side and what I'm going

159
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:17.900
to do is I'm going to save this right here and we are going to come to our game after 177 syntax error,

160
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.380
missing after 177.

161
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.610
So there is something that I've missed.

162
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.100
So 177.

163
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:36.420
177 oh, so this is an object, so we should not pass semicolon.

164
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.350
We should just pass in color and let's remove that.

165
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.500
I think now the error is gone.

166
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.020
Perfect.

167
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.520
So now if I click, you can see the side is selected.

168
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:53.360
Select, select, select, select, select, select, select, select, select.

169
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.230
And we can select.

170
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.870
Of course, there is still a lot of things that we need to cover.

171
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:06.240
Now, the first first off, what I want to do is I want to go to Bakhtawar select side function and

172
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.700
I want to the function declaration.

173
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:15.090
And whenever one of the players select SICI, the next turn should be the next player.

174
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.500
So where is our.

175
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.640
Where is the select site right here beneath these the current cells?

176
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.590
What I would like to do is I would like to switch the players.

177
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:37.000
So if it is player's turn, it is not player's turn, this is going to basically switch them.

178
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.350
And I'm going to say

179
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.710
switch.

180
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:48.220
Switch the player, so now we should see both of the players playing.

181
00:13:49.760 --> 00:14:00.220
Orange, green, orange, green, orange, green, orange, green, orange, green, orange and green,

182
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.760
and now, OK, so everything seems to be working fine.

183
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.300
Let's go ahead and reload the page.

184
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:17.860
I'm not sure if you can really see this, but if you approach this from the bottom, you can see that

185
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.110
the color is changing.

186
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.520
It is very subtle.

187
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.800
So this is green.

188
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:22.600
This is green.

189
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:22.990
Right.

190
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.510
This one, if we go ahead and if we click on it, it is going to turn to orange.

191
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.450
And that is not something that we want.

192
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.040
The reason that this is happening is because we have not actually specified our neighbor.

193
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.080
So you can see that I've just drawn green here.

194
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.710
But if I click on, it is going to turn into an orange and now it is stuck there.

195
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.910
I can turn this to green as well.

196
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:54.600
So you are able to actually rewrite or redraw on the same line that has already been drawn.

197
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.410
So we need to take care of that as well.

198
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.240
So what I'm going to do is we are going to first determine which neighbor it is that has been there,

199
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.690
that has colic, and then we are going to highlight that neighbor.

200
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:17.050
So within our highlights side, this is this is the highlight side within there, what it is that we

201
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.770
would like to do.

202
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:26.730
So if the site is highlighted, we know that we want to push it to our current selves after we push

203
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:32.490
it to current levels, we want to determine the neighbor.

204
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:39.710
Is it like this, I think this is correct, we want to determine the neighbor, so for that, we are

205
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:49.040
going to say let's row equal to Eilerts, initialised the row to I, the column to J, and then we are

206
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.630
going to grab the highlight.

207
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:59.640
And we are just going to declare that, and at first we are going to grab our neighbor and we are going

208
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.650
to set it to true.

209
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.210
Of course, we are going to set it to false later.

210
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.890
But for now, we are just going to set it.

211
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:11.820
Now, there is going to be some logic that we need to right here for for us to be able to actually do

212
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.850
whatever it is that we want to do here.

213
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.860
We want to do here.

214
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.290
Right.

215
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:16.890
So.

216
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.870
Let's go ahead and let's actually do it.

217
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:29.990
So first off, we want to check if side if the side that has been selected equals the side that left.

218
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.000
So we are starting with the left.

219
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:38.590
If it is equal to the side, the left and J is greater than zero.

220
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.400
It means we have some columns there, what it is that we want.

221
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.930
So when this.

222
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.510
This side is equal to that.

223
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.140
So this is not greater than this inside the left.

224
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.880
So this is what we have selected, right?

225
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.150
So if I saw like this, what is the neighbor's perspective?

226
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.790
So this belongs to this.

227
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.480
Let's say this belongs to this cell.

228
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.300
What is the you know what?

229
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.130
I'm going to grab a left one so you can really understand.

230
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.530
So let's see.

231
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.710
Let's say this is my cell and this is the left part, which is orange.

232
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.740
So according to my perspective, this is going to be left.

233
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.160
But according to the neighbors perspective, which is this one, the left one, this is the neighbor.

234
00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.250
It is going to be a right side.

235
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.390
So we are going to consider the neighbors perspective as well.

236
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.170
So we are going to say.

237
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:48.020
The neighbors perspective are right, so I'm just going to write it from the neighbors perspective so

238
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.630
you can really understand what it is.

239
00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.720
It is, I would say, a little bit complicated.

240
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.810
But if you pay attention, it is not going to be then the column is going to be J minus one.

241
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:00.420
All right.

242
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:07.660
And we are going to reduce one number from the number of columns that we have because the columns is

243
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.680
greater than one.

244
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.690
It means that we are.

245
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.940
So this is column number one.

246
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.070
This is column number zero.

247
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.900
This column number one.

248
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.190
This is column number two.

249
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:24.850
So when the line is in the line number column number one, it means that is greater than zero because

250
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:29.260
J actually represents columns if it is greater than zero.

251
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.600
And we want to take care of the perspective for the neighbor, we should go one level back.

252
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.740
We should say J column minus one.

253
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.040
And we are going to get to this column because this column for which this to which the cell belongs

254
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.380
to is actually the neighbor for which we are setting the perspective.

255
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.990
So we are going one level back because the neighbor is on the left and the left of its on the left.

256
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.020
It is wonderful back and we are going to say J minus one.

257
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:05.170
And for the neighbor, what the neighbor would think, what side has been highlighted.

258
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.890
The neighbor would think that the side right.

259
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.120
Has been highlighted.

260
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:11.160
Right.

261
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:16.650
So this side for me it is left but for my neighbor it is right.

262
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.700
So we are going to set it to write.

263
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.820
Very, very simple logic here, guys.

264
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.100
So we are going to say al-Assaf al-Assaf side equals.

265
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.170
Now, we have talked about the left.

266
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.600
Let's go ahead and let's talk about the right.

267
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.760
So you know what?

268
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.460
I'm just going to copy this entire thing and I'm going to put it right here.

269
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.810
So if side is side, right equals to side right.

270
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.930
And J is less than.

271
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.200
The number of columns, minus one.

272
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.550
All right, where is the number of columns minus one coming from?

273
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.300
It is coming from right here.

274
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:06.810
All right, so we know that Jay represents columns, and if it is less than the the length of the columns

275
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.380
or minus one less than that, then it means that we have selected a right site.

276
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.950
So let's refresh that.

277
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.640
Now, let's think that this is our cell.

278
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.910
And if I click this, you remember that this site is minus one.

279
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.280
This site is plus one.

280
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:23.680
Right.

281
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.040
This site is greater.

282
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.100
The site is less than.

283
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.340
So if I select this for me, it is going to be right.

284
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.500
But for my neighbor and is going to be left.

285
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.110
We are going to grab and my neighbor is one level above me, it is greater than zero.

286
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.950
It is actually the reverse of the previous case.

287
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.900
So we are going to set the JTA plus one very simple logic, very simple.

288
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.790
If it is on the left, it means that we are moving towards the negative X direction.

289
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.320
We are going to subtract it.

290
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:58.460
If it is on the right, we are moving in the positive direction.

291
00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.110
It means we are going to add it on.

292
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.050
And now for the neighbor, it is going to be left.

293
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.810
So my right neighbors left.

294
00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.220
Simple, right.

295
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.600
Where is the.

296
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:18.160
OK, it's right there, perfect, so we have our if statement, it is going to end there.

297
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.350
The answer is going to start and end there.

298
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.820
So I'm going to write else here.

299
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:31.260
You know what, I'm just going to grab this entire al-Assaf and I'm going to copy it down below and

300
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.410
just copy it.

301
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.810
Let's put it right here.

302
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.450
Let's save it.

303
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:41.090
So now the next next stop, we are going to talk about the top and bottom for top and bottom.

304
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.540
We are talking about the rose.

305
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.420
So we are no longer talking about the GAO and the column.

306
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.050
So look right here.

307
00:21:50.220 --> 00:22:01.170
So if this that if side is equal to the top, the eye, when it when we are going to tell in which direction

308
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.110
we are traveling, we are traveling in the negative Y direction.

309
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.990
So for us it is going to be the positive.

310
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.480
So we are going to be greater than zero.

311
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.610
But for our neighbor it is going to be negative.

312
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:21.760
Because Nabor is one level above us, one level above, and success is one level lower.

313
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.340
And let's change this to Rosewell.

314
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:32.690
And based on the neighbor, it is going to be this side bar perfect.

315
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.030
So we have set aside is top for us.

316
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.440
Bottom is for the neighbor and our final condition.

317
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.700
Let's copy it and let's put it here.

318
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.590
If for us it is bottom for the neighbor, it is going to be tough.

319
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.250
And now we are one level up.

320
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:54.920
A neighbor is one level down, one level up in Cyesis means for the neighbor plus.

321
00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:01.420
And for our for us, it is going to be rose minus one.

322
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:12.070
And row column, row column, and if all of this and if none of this, where is our neighbor?

323
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.280
We have not used our name.

324
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.200
We are going to use that.

325
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.080
And if none of this returns true.

326
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.440
And if none of that is actually evaluated, we want our neighbor.

327
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.550
It means that we don't have any neighbor.

328
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.380
So we are going to set the neighbor to false.

329
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.160
If none of this is evaluated, we are just going to set it to false.

330
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.480
Now, this is going to take care of determining which neighbor it is, and the final step here would

331
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.300
be actually highlighting the neighbor, so highlighting the neighbor.

332
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:50.660
For that, we are going to say, if Nabor is true, we are going to grab our squares away.

333
00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:02.770
And from there, the row sorry, the row and the column does highlight, probably highlight, not highlight,

334
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.410
Craig just highlight.

335
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:12.480
And we're going to set it to highlight it means that we want to highlight it and then we want to push

336
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:18.210
that row and that column to our current selves, current selves, dot pusch.

337
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:26.680
We have a small object here, we are going to say RO is going to be equal to Roe and Carl is going to

338
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.650
be able to call, let's save it.

339
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.890
Hopefully we can remove that problem now.

340
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.140
So I'm going to say I'm going to reload that.

341
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.300
So if I click, we have this.

342
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.000
If I click here, we have that.

343
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:46.360
And now you can see that it doesn't matter which row I'm coming towards, we cannot rewrite the color.

344
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.140
So everything is working perfectly fine.

345
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.350
So select it.

346
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.660
We cannot see reselected again.

347
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.740
See, because we have said the perspective for all of the neighbors.

348
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.740
And that problem is solved now.

349
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:06.310
And that's just click to see if nothing weird is going on.

350
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.520
All right, so everything is perfectly fine, that is going to be it for this lecture.

351
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.490
See you guys in the next one.
