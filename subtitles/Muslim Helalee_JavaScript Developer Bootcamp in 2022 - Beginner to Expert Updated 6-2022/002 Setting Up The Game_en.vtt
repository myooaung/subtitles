00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.240
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.450
In this next lecture, we will go through some game set up.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.990
All right, so the first thing that I would like to discuss is where you can get this Firefox developer

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.440
edition.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.150
It is available at developer, dot org, Firefox developer.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.130
If you just go ahead and if you just type or search for Firefox developer edition, hopefully you will

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.260
see the link first.

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.880
This is in case you would like to keep up with me exactly like I do code along exactly like I do have

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.970
the same kind of set up, the same kind of browser and the same kind of viscose setup.

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.850
You could go that you could do this, but it is perfectly safe to use your Chrome Chrome browser.

11
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.530
I had a bug and I'm sure you're not going to have that.

12
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.120
And it is safe.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.020
You could use that.

14
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.530
But I prefer Firefox for this game because of their responsiveness thing that we should go over and

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.190
because there is going to be a lot of that in this game.

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.390
I this is for me, it is easier even for my previous course.

17
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.770
I did Firefox for the most part, for for example, I think 75, 70 percent of the course was Firefox.

18
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.800
I started with Chrome, but then I switched to Firefox because the Firefox console is way more intuitive

19
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.350
than it is for the Chrome.

20
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.560
There is actually a lot of things that you're going to get if you are working with e-mail and see a

21
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700
system that is, of course, you're going to get a lot of things.

22
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.260
It is even going to give you some notes.

23
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.950
If you have a mistake, it is even going to tell you where your mistake is.

24
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.840
It is going to give you an outline for your flux containers, for your great containers and that sort

25
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.160
of thing.

26
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.150
So when it comes to HDMI and Cyesis, I do prefer Firefox over Chrome, but when it comes to JavaScript,

27
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.580
I prefer Chrome over any other browser.

28
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.260
That's just a fact that the that everybody agrees.

29
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.150
I think for the most part people agree because Chrome is like there are some some things that are only

30
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.240
implemented in Chrome.

31
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.060
For example, the speech Santarus that we went over, that is for now just implemented in the Chrome.

32
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290
But Firefox is powerful as well.

33
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.700
It is just a matter of preference.

34
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.490
OK, so this is where you can get it.

35
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.400
And I would like to show you one more thing in case you're wondering about this theme, this theme,

36
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.800
I have changed it and you can go ahead and download it from the marketplace.

37
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.330
It is one dark pro.

38
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.220
I really love this theme.

39
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.410
This is like it truly this is the atoms iconic one dark theme.

40
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860
I think this is the atoms code ed theme.

41
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.630
Very, very nice theme.

42
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.440
Right.

43
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.770
So in case you're wondering about that as well, and I have included a link here and that is to a Fabricant

44
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.980
in case you're getting that message and the console, that 404 cannot get Fabricant fabric on that icon,

45
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.300
that sort of message.

46
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:19.290
If you if you're getting it, then just go ahead and insert this in the head part of your in the head

47
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.720
section of the e-mail document, and you will you'll never see that message again.

48
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.570
OK, it's just just a hack that you should do.

49
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.480
And that message is actually nothing.

50
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.310
You could go ahead and ignore it as well.

51
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.550
And let's go over this style, which is very minimal.

52
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.540
We have a reset.

53
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.250
We have the body over Florida and the canvas is display block.

54
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.040
Aside from the script that we have included in the body, we literally have nothing else in the body.

55
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.320
We are not going to include anything on as far as the canvas is concerned, we will be creating that

56
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.360
dynamically inside the JavaScript.

57
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.790
So let's go ahead and let's actually start coding this, the first thing that I would like to create

58
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.390
is going to be our game parameters, right?

59
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.590
So I just want to give you a heads up as well.

60
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.850
And this might not happen that often.

61
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.200
And this is because there are a lot of logic behind what's actually what what you saw on the screen.

62
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.890
Right.

63
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.230
And there are going to be some times when I would like to extend the length of a lecture beyond 20 minutes

64
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.570
or even beyond 30 minutes.

65
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.980
I'm not going to go to 40 not I'm going to I may go to 40, but I'm not going to move beyond 40 minutes.

66
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.160
I would like to keep it a 20 minute mark because there is a lot of continuity in this game.

67
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.570
And if I, like, keep this game in short, like lectures, like seven minute lectures and short bursts,

68
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.940
then you're going to lose that continuity.

69
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.920
And that's even easier for me if I just create seven minute lectures.

70
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.150
And that is not that is going to be a better feeling for them because a 20 minute lecture is more prone

71
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.620
to issues and bugs than a seven minute lecture.

72
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.070
Right.

73
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.400
But because of the continuity, for the sake of the continuity of this game, continuity of the logic,

74
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.020
I would like to keep like lectures not to a maximum length, but to the length that they actually require.

75
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.520
So this game is actually created in Bunte in chunks.

76
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.910
So each chunk of the game is going to have like a certain amount of time, some chunks, maybe five

77
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.530
minutes, some chunks, maybe 10 minutes, some chunks, maybe 30 minutes.

78
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.130
So if it is 30 minutes, then bear with me because we are going to do a lot of things.

79
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.450
We are going to create we are going to create an awesome game.

80
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:57.790
And almost like a lot of concepts of JavaScript are going to be used here is in especially the object

81
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.890
oriented paradigm.

82
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.170
So in case you're even having trouble understanding that, this is also a good practice for you, too.

83
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.440
So you will see that how powerful JavaScript can get.

84
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.530
So without further ado, let's go ahead and let's start that.

85
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.570
So I will be creating all these everything from scratch.

86
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.870
I will try to do that.

87
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:25.090
So the first thing that I would like to create is going to be the paddle with and I'm going to put it

88
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.950
to zero point one now.

89
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.190
Zero point one is going to be the fraction of the screen with.

90
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.940
And the reason for that is whenever you go smaller, the paddle is going to get smaller.

91
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.300
So if I go smaller, you can see that paddles with is getting smaller.

92
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.390
If I go big, the paddles with is going to get bigger.

93
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.560
Right.

94
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.270
So that is going to be a fraction of the screen width.

95
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.370
And next stop, we are going to have our paddle and rescore speed, which you know what it is.

96
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.980
It is going to be zero point five.

97
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.120
Now, this is going to be a fraction of the speed, the screen width per second.

98
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:09.850
And it means that it is going to take two seconds for this paddle to cross the screen to get from one

99
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.650
side of the screen to the next side.

100
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.770
Next up, we are going to have the ball speed.

101
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.370
And I've said it to 4.5, you could set it to higher a higher value than that, right?

102
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.800
Then we have a concert ball spin.

103
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.140
And you know what this ball spin is?

104
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.640
That is when it hits the brick, it it goes in like it.

105
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.920
It has a deflect angle.

106
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.260
It deflects a little.

107
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:46.120
And we have set it to zero point to now the maximum deflection is going to be one.

108
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.120
If you set it to one, you're going to get a maximum deflection.

109
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.860
But we want a minimal one.

110
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.380
So let's create our wall as well.

111
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.550
And this is going to have zero point zero two two size.

112
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.610
This size is going to be the size for the wall, for the ball, for the part and for the panel as a

113
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.500
fraction of the shortest screen dimension.

114
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:13.000
So what I would like to do is I would like to copy these comments and I would like to put them here

115
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.210
because this is going to be a very large game and.

116
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.470
All right, so what did I do there?

117
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.680
And this is going to help you a lot, these comments, in case you have some trouble, in case you have

118
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.860
trouble understanding them, these are going to help you a lot.

119
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.409
I've written them here and I want you to have them as well.

120
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.470
I don't want you to really worry about these parameters that we specify here.

121
00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:46.490
All right, so now we are done with this, and the next thing that I would like to do is I would like

122
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.410
to come down and I would like to create some colors as well.

123
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.320
So this lecture is is is dedicated to set up.

124
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.040
So the first color that I would like to create is going to be the background color and I'm going to

125
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.910
set it to block.

126
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:02.680
You can't change it.

127
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.230
You can set it to whatever you want.

128
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.190
For example, if I change it from here to blue, you're going to see that it is blue.

129
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.710
It's up to you, whichever you think is going to look cool or look better.

130
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:20.330
I want to stick to the original as much as I can, and I'm going to create three more colors as well.

131
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.960
So the next one is going to be color wall, which I'm going to set it to gray.

132
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.480
Let's say gray, not black, gray, just great.

133
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:41.770
The next one is going to be color, paddle, paddle, and right after that we are going to have a ball.

134
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.400
So for both of them, we are going to have you could change the color as well.

135
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.240
But I'm just going to set it to white.

136
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.530
Perfect right after that.

137
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:58.310
What I want to do is I want to grab I don't want to define some definitions.

138
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.760
I want to do some definitions and these definitions.

139
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.330
Definitions are responsible for the sorry, not definitions.

140
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:15.170
Why do I keep definitions, I want to define some directions, not definitions are and these directions

141
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:23.310
are going to specify which direction it is that the ball or the paddle is moving.

142
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.840
So the first round, I'm going to set it and I'm going to give it a value of zero.

143
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.790
The next one I'm going to say to.

144
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.190
Right.

145
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.580
So if it is going to go to right, there's going to be one.

146
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.100
And if it stops.

147
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.000
It is going to have a value of two, so these are the directions perfecto.

148
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:49.670
First, right after that, I'm going to grab our dimensions and I'm just going to declare them, so

149
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.630
I'm going to say with.

150
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.340
And then height and then wall.

151
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.550
All right, so.

152
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:09.900
OK, so right after that, what I would like to do is I would like to set up the canvas so we can actually

153
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.680
see something.

154
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:16.060
So setting up the canvas and context.

155
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.580
Now, in this lecture, which we could use the canvas context word itself, but why should why don't

156
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:31.520
we just go ahead and, like, come up with a shorthand for a common shorthand is Sirtex.

157
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.260
But I don't like that codecs.

158
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:42.150
Let's say canvas Alamin document that now the element is not present in the table, so I will be creating

159
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.630
it here.

160
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:49.470
The Alamin name is Canvas and then I'm going to grab the document Darte Body.

161
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:59.540
And I'm going to say a Penn child, I penned this canvas, a Penn child, the canvas element, perfect.

162
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.960
And then I'm going to grab the initialise the set of the context.

163
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.300
So if I do, can.

164
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:20.540
Ex, con or con or context, I think Conex context think that looks cool.

165
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.660
So this is going to be a recanvas context.

166
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.810
You could use whatever you want, of course.

167
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:32.150
So canvas aliment, get context and the context is going to be 2D.

168
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.150
Let's save that, let's actually go ahead and open this up with live server and there it is.

169
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:46.660
This is our canvas and we have created the canvas, but we have not provided the canvas any height or

170
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:52.690
any width or any sort of any any height, any worth or any kinds of dimensions.

171
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.600
So we will be doing that shortly.

172
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:03.930
Ah, right, so right after that, what I would like to do is I would like to go ahead and create our

173
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:13.290
game loop, so I'm just going to call it I'm just going to give you a bigger comment, the game.

174
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:22.200
We will be having a ton of functions, so I would like to like make these functions comments a lot of

175
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.100
unique, so you keep track of where the functions actually are.

176
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.150
So I'm just going to put it right here, OK?

177
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:35.400
I think that is too much in case you're screwing your laptop screen with a smile, then this is going

178
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.410
to mess up your in this entire code.

179
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.060
So I'm just going to make it.

180
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:48.190
Let's do this, that's even big, so I'm just going to decrease this side further.

181
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.330
OK, I hope now this is cool, right, so we will be using this for naming your functions.

182
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.970
Now let's create the function.

183
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.920
I'm going to say function, I'm going to call it play game.

184
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:05.610
And this function is going to request animation from and in there we are going to pass and the play

185
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:05.970
game.

186
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.050
Right.

187
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:16.350
And OK, so what this is going to do is this is going to graph for the animation frame.

188
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:16.710
Right.

189
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:24.570
And each time we call that animation frame, this this entire function is going to get called and this

190
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:32.610
entire function is going to get called for like 60 times for one second.

191
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:38.320
That is because of the aspect, the refresh rate of our screen.

192
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.690
All right.

193
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.720
So we have a defined our dimensions.

194
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.050
Now, let's go ahead and let's actually call this function.

195
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.090
So I'm going to say play game and I'm going to call that function.

196
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.910
Now, this function is actually running.

197
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:04.670
OK, so the next thing that I would like to do is I would like to create a set, a dimension's function.

198
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.410
So I'm going to come down, I'm going to come down there, I'm going to grab that comment and I'm going

199
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.820
to put it right there.

200
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.540
And I'm going to say set dimensions.

201
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.060
Let's tussin the function keyboard as well.

202
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:28.610
So let's create the let's say function, set dimensions, set dimensions, set dimensions.

203
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.170
Perfect.

204
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.690
There is not going to be any parameter.

205
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.320
So the height now, you know, we have declared the height.

206
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.040
So the height is going to be the window dot in our height.

207
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:48.530
The width is going to be window dot enter with the wall.

208
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.760
It's going to be our wall.

209
00:15:53.430 --> 00:16:03.510
Times now, if the devices are horizontal, sorry, if the device is high, it is less than the devices

210
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.530
with, what does it mean?

211
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:11.620
It means that the device is actually in landscape mode and in that mode, what do we want to do?

212
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:19.160
We want to keep the walls with or thickness to based off the height of that device.

213
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.080
Otherwise you are going to do it based off the width.

214
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:28.320
So if the device is high, it is less than the devices with.

215
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.390
It means that the screen as it means the screen is landscape.

216
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:43.050
So we want the walls to be times the height, otherwise we want it to be wartimes with right now, let's

217
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.730
grab our canvas element.

218
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:52.900
That with so the canvas width is going to be equal to width and the canvas is height.

219
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.880
Is going to be equal to height.

220
00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:04.000
Perfect, and I think that is going to be it for now, for this said dimension's function, OK, so

221
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.440
the only thing remaining here is for us to actually call this function and to to be able to see the

222
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.990
result.

223
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.890
So on top of this game loop, what I would like to do is I'm going to comment.

224
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.060
I'm going to grab that comment.

225
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.020
I'm going to put it here.

226
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.650
So this is going to be the resize event.

227
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:30.890
I'm going to call it resize event or let's just call it resize windows or resize window event.

228
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:39.250
So for this, we are going to grab our window, not documents a window dot our the center and the event

229
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.600
is going to be precise.

230
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.550
And when the event is resized, we are going to call the the set dimensions function.

231
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.790
So now the function is called here.

232
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:55.120
What I would like to do, as I would like to come here and write on top of this play game, I would

233
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.750
like to execute the function right here.

234
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.580
So let's say let's come here and.

235
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:09.610
All right, so the reason that we don't see anything yet is because we haven't drawn our background

236
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.200
yet.

237
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:19.310
So what I would like to do is I would like to come down here this why is this certain dimensions?

238
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.970
It should be set dimensions.

239
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.790
You know what?

240
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.920
I'm going to go on top of this set dimension's.

241
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:31.870
Function and let's copy this comment, let's put it right here and I'm going to call this function draw.

242
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:40.220
Background, perfect, so now what it is that we want to do, we want to a background, each time the

243
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.610
screen is being read, the screen is being refreshed.

244
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:51.650
All right, so we are going to grab this drawback background, define it here, and we will be calling

245
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.490
it inside our play game function.

246
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.920
So let's say function.

247
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:08.740
Draw back a grand and what it is that we want to do, we basically want to draw a rectangle that is

248
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.880
going to be our canvas.

249
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.660
So we are going to grab the canvas context and we are going to say Phil style.

250
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.490
So what is different style color?

251
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:23.800
It is going to be the color color B.G. that we have specified.

252
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:30.010
And we are going to grab our canvas context and we are going to say, Phil RACT.

253
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:40.580
What is the zero, the exposition zero y position zero, the U.S. is going to be the canvas element

254
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:47.510
dot with and the height is going to be the canvas element at height.

255
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:48.830
Perfect.

256
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.730
So stop it, save it there and come here.

257
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.520
Why don't we see that?

258
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.680
So it is it has a value.

259
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.160
Why do we have to color pages.

260
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.140
How do we have to color backgrounds.

261
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.530
So we have called it right here as well.

262
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:11.210
So it is a concept that fills style.

263
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.190
Have we done any mistake in here?

264
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:22.970
So we have canvas element that get context to canvas element that create a document that create element,

265
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.310
document that body canvas element.

266
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.960
We have done everything perfectly fine.

267
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.030
Hmm.

268
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:37.700
So we have our canvas with we have our oh we didn't call this background even though even though I told

269
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.030
you that we need to call it so I'm going to call this a drawback ground function right there.

270
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.770
So let's save it now.

271
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.250
There we go.

272
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.500
So this is our canvas.

273
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.440
Our canvas has been successfully drawn.

274
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.000
So I hope you can see the difference between this council and the canvas.

275
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.120
So for that, you know what?

276
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.780
Let's set it to dark.

277
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:10.120
I won't be changing it if I remember, and I will be changing it to the block.

278
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.370
It doesn't.

279
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.600
I tried many colors, but it didn't work.

280
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.200
So let's try dark, dark blue.

281
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.440
It didn't look good.

282
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.670
So I'm going to keep it to black.

283
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:27.090
And I'm sure you can get the gravity, get the difference between the console.

284
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.190
The console is right here.

285
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.160
This is our canvas.

286
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.920
So we have successfully drawn our canvas.

287
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.000
And that's it for this lecture.

288
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.630
See you guys in the next one.
