00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.920
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.990
In this letter, we are going to talk about more dumb events.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.310
All right, so the first event that I want to discuss in this lecture is the double click or the double

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.640
click.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.070
So this event only fires when the user double clicks on something.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.560
Right.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.270
You might you might have seen in some websites where when you double click and you try to select the

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.500
text to copy.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.470
Or when you tried to just selected the website, is not going to allow you to do that.

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.300
OK, some very, very like highly improbable.

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.250
But it I have I have faced such websites and this is the event for that.

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.130
Right.

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.340
So what I'm going to do is we are going to grab these two buttons.

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.530
And when the user double clicks on the change, VIJI we are going to change the background color on

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.980
when the user double clicks, double click, not single click double click on the Reset.

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.150
We are going to reset the background color.

17
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.740
All right.

18
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.010
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to select our change between.

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.700
Right.

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.840
And I'm going to select it.

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.610
I'm going to say document that query selector.

22
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.480
And what is the class name?

23
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.720
The class name is Change Dash Biji.

24
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.380
Yes.

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.510
And I'm going to select the reset button as well.

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.560
So in here I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say reset set.

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.260
Now we have successfully selected the button and now what I'm going to do is when the user double clicks

28
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.940
on the.

29
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.740
And the change button, I want to run a function, so the event that we are looking for or we are actually

30
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.960
listening for is Double-Click.

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.210
It's written as double click.

32
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.370
Right.

33
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.040
And then we are going to run a callback function.

34
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.310
And what does the callback function is going to do?

35
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.820
It is going to grab the document.

36
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.880
That body it is going to grab the body is going to say that style, that background color.

37
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.800
And we are going to set it to hash eight F.

38
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.540
Si, si, si, oh, a night, and we are not going to print anything to the console because we are going

39
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.900
to see it.

40
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.830
So double click the background.

41
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.080
This change, we could print something to the console for better understanding purposes, understandability

42
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:44.800
purposes, the change B B, the change big button has been double clicked.

43
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.870
Right.

44
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.640
So let's double click.

45
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.830
And the event has fired the change.

46
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.810
Big button has been double clicked.

47
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.580
And now when the user clicks on the reset, we want to reset the background color.

48
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.470
So we are going to put it right here and we are going to say reset.

49
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.340
Right.

50
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.800
And we are going to change the background color to F F and let's save it.

51
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.890
So double click the change button.

52
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.350
Big button has been double clicked.

53
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.130
The reset button has been double clicked.

54
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.080
Let's capitalize this R and so this is the double click event.

55
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.830
All right.

56
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.180
The next event that I want to talk about is the mouseover event.

57
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.530
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to comment these two events out.

58
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.400
But we need these these variables, right?

59
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.070
So let's go ahead and copy that.

60
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.120
Put it right here.

61
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.390
And I don't think we need this much real estate in our Web page, but we do need it in our editor.

62
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.960
So this is way better.

63
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.810
So this one is going to be mouse over.

64
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.770
OK, so the first mouse event is going to be mouse over, and this this is when the user mouse is over

65
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.710
an element and without even clicking, the background should change and we are going to do that.

66
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.200
So we are going to say change B10.

67
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.490
Beating that out of a listener, what is the event that we want to listen for, the event is going to

68
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.560
be mouse over.

69
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.730
All right.

70
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.710
It is so weird, the JavaScript in this part, it is not complicated.

71
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.060
All right.

72
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.370
It is not case.

73
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.640
And we are going to run a callback function and we are going to say document that body, basically we

74
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.630
want to do this.

75
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.170
So I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to put it right here.

76
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.650
And now let's let's hover over it and boom, the background color has changed.

77
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.470
We can consider log something as well.

78
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.040
So this has been.

79
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.820
I'm going to say moused over correct sentence, boom.

80
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.460
The change BBT, sorry, the change big button has been moused over.

81
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.390
So this is the mouseover event.

82
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.110
All right.

83
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.080
We can and it doesn't matter how many times and it is going to fire that many times, so we have marched

84
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.460
over that six times, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

85
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.950
It doesn't matter how many times.

86
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.310
Right?

87
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.040
So very, very cool.

88
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:34.110
So this is the mouseover event, we also have the most out event now the mouseover activates when you

89
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:44.010
hover over that element and the mouse out event activates when you hover away from the element.

90
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.880
All right.

91
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.560
So kind of the same, but actually different.

92
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.970
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to copy it down below.

93
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.130
And we are going to change the over with out.

94
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.780
So we are going to come in this one back, and so now if I hover over it, nothing is going to change.

95
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.950
But if I hover away, then the background color is going to change, right.

96
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.260
So in the mouse, I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to add it to the reset.

97
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.610
So it's really, really visible.

98
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.280
What we are doing and this is Fefe and I'm going to keep this commented in as well.

99
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.260
All right.

100
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.420
So when we have her on it, the background color is going to change and it doesn't matter if we hover

101
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.200
away or not.

102
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.430
The background color is change.

103
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.340
We are going to do that one more time.

104
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.690
So hover on the background.

105
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:41.070
Color has changed, but when we hover on this reset button, the background color does not reset because

106
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.220
it is a mouse out of the mouse should be out of the field.

107
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.730
So when it goes out of the field, David fires.

108
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.560
Right.

109
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.630
So these are very, very cool and handy.

110
00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:01.510
Most events that we have in JavaScript, the next and the final event that I want to talk about in this

111
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:10.060
lecture is the scroll event and the scroll event happens on something called the window object.

112
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.120
The window object is actually the global JavaScript object object.

113
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.640
It is like the top dog in JavaScript.

114
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.940
All right, so let's go ahead and let's see what we can do with this and for this, we don't need any

115
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.430
we don't need to grab any element because this works when the user scrolls.

116
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.630
OK, this is not like a wheel most real event.

117
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.540
It is a scroll event.

118
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.530
So when the website is scroll, this event is going to fire.

119
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.980
Right.

120
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.770
So for that to work, we need more content.

121
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.340
So for that to work, I'm going to reduce the width of this window and we are going to go ahead and

122
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.220
we are going to add some content here.

123
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.080
So lorem and let's say five hundred seventy.

124
00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.510
Wow.

125
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.410
A lot of content.

126
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:00.730
Right.

127
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.900
So now we have a scroll bar, OK.

128
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:11.720
And when the scroll bar moves, even by one millimeter, one nanometre, then, then the event is going

129
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.700
to fire when it just moves.

130
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.960
OK, then the event is going to fire, so we are going to say we add this event on the global object,

131
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.610
which is the window object.

132
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:31.180
So before going there, let's just go ahead and write Window Window here and let's press enter and let's

133
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.210
take a look at the window.

134
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.090
So now you guys can see this is actually an object because the syntax says so.

135
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.850
And in here we have a lot of stuff.

136
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.750
For example, we have alert, which is a global window object.

137
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:48.610
We have blurr, we have cash chrome and clear intervale.

138
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.170
Clear time out.

139
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.840
Let's take a look and let's look for we have all the events that we have.

140
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.470
So they are global.

141
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.000
They are properties or methods of the global object.

142
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.500
Let's see if we can find some time out.

143
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:11.890
There it is so said Time Out is actually a method of the global object that we have successfully implemented

144
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.710
in one of our previous lectures.

145
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.860
So we have all these methods and functions, everything there is, there is a lot.

146
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.950
So this is the window object.

147
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.430
A cool thing right in JavaScript.

148
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:33.130
So let's go ahead and let's grab the window and we are going to paint a method to the window object.

149
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:40.220
And this method is going to is an event, the center, which is going to listen for a scroll event.

150
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.800
And when the scroll event happens, we are going to run a callback function.

151
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.300
And when the callback function runs, what do we want to do?

152
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.580
We want to grab the document, that body.

153
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.410
Right.

154
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.800
And I could consider log document that body for you in here.

155
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:04.310
And we are going to say body C, so whenever you do document that body, you're going to get the body

156
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.450
element of your e-mail document and everything is inside the body.

157
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.340
So you could do that as well.

158
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.060
If you want to check if this selector works, you could do that.

159
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.710
I guess not.

160
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.420
Guess we did it so.

161
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.270
Style, dot, background, background, color.

162
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.020
I'm just going to say line.

163
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.140
Line, right?

164
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:32.860
So when the user scrolls, I want to increase the line height to two point one very, very large value

165
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.010
and I'm going to say, you know, this is enough.

166
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.410
So now we have.

167
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:39.650
Oops.

168
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.930
Well, I wanted to be a surprise, and this is not a surprise.

169
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.140
Because we are there, let's reset.

170
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.560
Yep.

171
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.910
So if I bring this down and if I just remove the scroll bar, but even like one millimeter, then the

172
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:59.890
event fires and the line hydra has increased, we can do something else as well.

173
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.650
Let's just put it to blue.

174
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:13.010
And we can say the background color is going to be blue and the color of the text is going to be white.

175
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:20.000
Let's put it to white, let's say so now when we come here, everything has changed.

176
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:27.270
So this was the final event that I wanted to work with in this lecture.

177
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.420
I'm just going to demonstrate that one more time.

178
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:36.570
See, this happens and see you guys in the next lecture where we I think we'll we will talk even more

179
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.490
about dumb events.
