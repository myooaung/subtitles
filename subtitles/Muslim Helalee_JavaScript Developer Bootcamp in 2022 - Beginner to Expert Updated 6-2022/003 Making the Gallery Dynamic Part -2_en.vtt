00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.440
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.170
In this lecture, we are going to go ahead and complete the image gallery pop project.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.210
All right, so.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.410
This is where we left off in our previous lecture, we talked about how there are three issues with

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.030
this pop up, the first one being that whenever we click on any image, we see the first image.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.900
The reason for that is we have hardcoded that image in the e-mail.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.850
The second issue is whenever we click on any image, we don't see the higher resolution image for that,

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.250
for even if it is the rabbit.

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.120
But we don't see the high resolution image for the rabbit.

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.970
And the third one is which is I actually like him very, very important.

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.770
One is we don't have any way of getting out of this model dynamically.

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.000
So we we need to refresh the page.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.840
So now let's go ahead and let's dive into the JavaScript.

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.210
The first thing that I want to do is I want to grab the full image first.

15
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.020
So I'm going to say whenever the user clicks on any of the images, just show the full image for that

16
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.380
image.

17
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.430
Now, this is not going to show the full image for any image that has been clicked specifically, but

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.670
it is going to show the full image version of the rabbit.

19
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.630
So if we click here, this is the for this is the full image of this rabbit.

20
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.530
So we still have two other issues left.

21
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.070
The first one, we are not targeting the correct image and the second one, we don't have any way of

22
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.940
getting out of it.

23
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.360
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to get out of that function and I'm going to here add a comment

24
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.450
that says Changing the change.

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.340
And I'm just going to go ahead and say changing the images dynamically.

26
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.380
All right.

27
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.780
So now we need to go ahead and change the image dynamically.

28
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come into the demo and I have to tell you one more thing that

29
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.190
I left out on purpose, of course, and that is the out the alt attribute for these images in our gallery

30
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.630
start from one and they go all the way to 10 exactly as the name for our images when they are in full

31
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.510
resolution.

32
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.300
So the out value is the same as the name of these images.

33
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.970
As you guys can see that the name of the image is one if we come here and if you see it says one all

34
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.730
the way to 10.

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.770
So this is something that I've done deliberately.

36
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.210
And now what we are going to do is through that attribute, we are going to be able to change the images

37
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.110
dynamically.

38
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.840
So I'm going to create another constant because in this constant, I want to store the alt attribute

39
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.860
and I'm going to say original quality.

40
00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.280
And I'm going to store I'm going to grab our image and each time this for each loop, this foreach loops

41
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.180
variable, which is the image loop image loops over our gallery, it is going to grab one of the images

42
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.550
and whatever it grabs that image.

43
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.790
We want to grab the we want to say get attribute.

44
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.950
What is the attribute that we want to get?

45
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.450
It is the outer attribute.

46
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.510
So whenever we get the alt attribute, we are going to get numbers from one to 10.

47
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.760
And what is the name for the images which are in high resolution?

48
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.960
Exactly.

49
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.730
It is numbers from one to 10.

50
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.880
So we are going to say four image dot sirc.

51
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.360
Yes, this is the SS and we are going to use our template literals or tippler strengths.

52
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.540
We are going to go into our images folder from there.

53
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.300
We are going to navigate to the full folder and then we are going to say one dot jpg.

54
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.770
But there is a problem with this syntax, this syntax is not dynamic because we have, again, hardcoded

55
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.750
the first image.

56
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.340
So how can we how can we make sure that whichever image the user clicks on, that image is going to

57
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.370
appear and that image has a name.

58
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.720
So what is the image name?

59
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.829
It is a no.

60
00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.170
What is the range for that number?

61
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.870
It starts from one to ten.

62
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.420
And why did we use the art?

63
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.870
Because the art value starts from one to ten.

64
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.660
So in here, I'm just going to go ahead and reference the original quality, the original quality variable

65
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.320
in which we have stored the value of the art, which starts from one and goes all the way to ten.

66
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.390
And now, because this is a variable, it is going to change each time.

67
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.320
This for each loop runs on this image loop, variable loops over this gallery.

68
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.070
So let's save it and let's come here.

69
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.410
So if I click on the Sediuk, we are going to see the rabbit for some reason.

70
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.530
And let's click on this one.

71
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.870
We see again the rabbit.

72
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.990
So let's go ahead and check out what is the problem here.

73
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.790
So we get the art, we are going to go inside the images folder and inside the full, this is our full

74
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.880
image and we grab the source and we say that JPEG, this is the original quality.

75
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.350
Okey dokey, so let's come in to our index.

76
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:37.500
We have 10 hours, nine and eight that's coming to our image and then we have full all the way to image

77
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.120
number 10.

78
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.570
So it should work.

79
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.470
I mean, the code is correct to my knowledge.

80
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.260
We have our original quality.

81
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.050
But for some reason, we are not getting what we hoped for.

82
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.660
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to open it to a life server one more time and I'm going to

83
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.440
close this one.

84
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.700
So let's click on the Robert.

85
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.450
We see another rabbit.

86
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.370
I mean, that is cool.

87
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.470
But still, we want to grab our image.

88
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.370
But now in here, we don't see we we are not getting what we are looking for.

89
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:19.910
And I think I think I found out the problem, the problem lies in here because we have we have we are

90
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:27.950
out of this function and we should not be out of it, because whenever the image this is the loop variable

91
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.110
and whenever this is quaked, OK, we have added an event listener on the image.

92
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.440
So we should stay inside the function for that event.

93
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.290
Listener and this is a part of the event as well.

94
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.910
So let's say let's click on this.

95
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.350
We see this bird.

96
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.340
Let's refresh.

97
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.810
I see, like pack of deers or I don't know, like what is the actual name?

98
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.760
I've forgotten that.

99
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.260
So two cats we are going to see is rhinos, rhinoceros.

100
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.880
We are going to see a rabid dog.

101
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.320
And so this is working properly, dolphins'.

102
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.960
GLAST Robert Parrot, and then we have two dogs, and I think that's it.

103
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.880
So now we have only one other issue that we need to solve, and that is whenever we click on any image,

104
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.190
we should be able to remove that model as well.

105
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.190
So in here, what I'm going to do is we are going to grab our model.

106
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.870
All right.

107
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.700
So this is the model and we're going to add an event listener, add event listener, and we are going

108
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.960
to listen for a click.

109
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.880
So what what is it?

110
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.310
Was it.

111
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.300
What is it exactly that I want to do?

112
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:46.840
I want to be able to click whenever I'm out of this image, click anywhere out of this image.

113
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.830
I want this model to be removed.

114
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.510
For example, when I click on this one.

115
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.930
So if I click here, the model goes away.

116
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.200
If I click here, the model goes away.

117
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.240
If I click on the top, the model Glossop goes away.

118
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.240
And if I click on the bottom, the model goes away.

119
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.450
But whenever I click on the image, the model still stays.

120
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.020
So let's go ahead and implement that.

121
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.210
And we know how how we can do that.

122
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:17.980
Whenever we listen for a click, we run a function and this time we are going to grab our event object.

123
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:25.060
And we have talked about the event objects, target value or target property.

124
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:33.610
So we are going to say if you see the target whenever the event objects, Target has a class.

125
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:44.640
Or contains just going to go ahead and turn into dust when the class contains what it contains, open

126
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.650
or not open, it contains moral, then do what?

127
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:56.760
Then go ahead and grab the moral and remove that class list.

128
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.630
All right.

129
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.510
So remove what is the class that we want to remove?

130
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.060
It is the open class that we want to remove.

131
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.770
And we also want the full image to not have that class as well.

132
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.920
So before the for the full image, let's go ahead and let's implement that.

133
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.840
So if we click on this and if we click away, are going to see that both of them, they go away, but

134
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.480
now we don't see our our pop up.

135
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:23.880
Right.

136
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.020
We don't see the problem.

137
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.960
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead.

138
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.960
I'm going to remove it from the full image as well.

139
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.370
So full image, let's save it, and now we see that policy.

140
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.420
Now we have a transition, so all the images, they should work, so when I click here, it's going

141
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.020
to go away.

142
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.620
When I click here, it's going to go away when I click anywhere.

143
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.080
So what does this means?

144
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:59.010
It means if the user clicks anywhere where it does not contain the model, then then keep the model.

145
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:07.630
But when the user clicks anywhere that contains the model class, then remove the open class from the

146
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.040
model and from the image.

147
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.310
And what is the open class, the upper classes, opacity one.

148
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.770
And when the opacity one is removed, the model is going to go away.

149
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.230
See, the model goes away.

150
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:24.080
So this image is our full image and this background is actually our model.

151
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.800
So whenever the user clicks anywhere on the model itself, not the image.

152
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:37.850
Then the model is going to be removed, and when the user also clicks on the model, the image is going

153
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.990
to be removed as well.

154
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.040
All right.

155
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.490
And whenever the user clicks on the image itself, nothing is going to happen.

156
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.390
So for the user to get out of this should click away.

157
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.230
So this is it for this lecture and for this chapter.

158
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.510
See you guys in the next chapter.
