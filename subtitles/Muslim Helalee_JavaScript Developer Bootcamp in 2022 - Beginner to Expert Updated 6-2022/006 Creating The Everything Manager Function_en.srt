00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,400
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will be creating the everything manager function.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,600
All right, now, this function has the job of detecting the edges, moving the ball, increasing the

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,390
ball speed in this function, we will be creating our A.I. will also playing our sound, some of them

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,980
in here.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,350
Right.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,729
And what I'm going to do is on the top of there, I'm just going to say the everything manager.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:44,070
Function, OK, that's fine function, right, and that's going to be actually the name of that function.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,130
So I'm going to say function everything.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,080
Everything, manager.

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:57,580
So, manager, they're not going to be any parameters there, so the first thing that I want to do is

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,680
I actually want to move the ball.

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:08,590
So in order to move the ball, I want to I will be increasing the ball position by its velocity first.

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:08,980
Simple.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,070
So ball that XP should be.

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,470
We add on to it the velocity.

16
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,400
Keep in mind, don't just sit like equal to velocity.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,660
Let's see what's going to happen.

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:28,330
If I just do that ball dot x v, I'm going to call the everything manager inside the game in it because

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,260
we want it to be like to happen 60 times per one second.

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,450
That's why we created the game in it, because we had an everything manager in it as well.

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,890
So let's save it.

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,600
And there we go.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,190
You can see that the ball is right there.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,970
It's there and it's not moving again because we have set the balls, the exposition to the velocity.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,970
But if I if I say add on to it and save and come, you can see that it is now moving.

26
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:02,590
It goes off the canvas, but it's actually moving because we are adding five pixels and then five pixels

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,150
and then five pixels, the amount that is for the velocity.

28
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,480
Right.

29
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,699
We are basically adding that amount to it.

30
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,950
The same thing is going to happen to the Y position, so I'm just going to do Y and now the ball should

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,680
move in both of the directions that we go.

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,360
So in X and in a combination of X and Y.

33
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,090
Right.

34
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,440
So that's done.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:36,210
The next part is I want to whenever the ball hits that any wall, I want it to bounce off the walls.

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,480
So I'm going to say bouncing.

37
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:58,900
Bouncing off the top and bottom walls, right, and in here, not there, moving the ball by the amount

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,320
of acceleration.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,550
All right, so how can we bounce it off?

40
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:13,950
We have to find out the radius and the Y position and also for the because we are only bouncing it off

41
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,080
from the top and the bottom, we don't need the canvas with or the exposition.

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,500
We just need the Y position because we wanted to go past the canvas so a score can happen.

43
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:34,020
So we say if the ball, if the Y position or the vertical position of the ball is greater than canvases,

44
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,630
canvas elements, height, it means that the ball has gone off.

45
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,150
How much the ball has gone off, it should go off by its full radius.

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,250
Right.

47
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:55,170
OK, so this is when the ball goes off the canvas from the top part of it, from the bottom part of

48
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,700
the canvas.

49
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,930
What if the ball goes off the top of the top part of the canvas?

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,060
So again, we are going to see a ball that wipe the vertical position when it goes less than zero bytes

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,740
for radius.

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,000
So we can just say plus baldor radius, which I'm not going to do.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,370
I'm just going to put in minus Baudot radius so you can say zero plus ball the radius.

54
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,460
We have done that in our previous projects.

55
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm not going to explain that anymore.

56
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:34,980
So whenever ball excuse me, whenever the ball hits either the bottom side of the canvas or the top,

57
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,010
it should reverse its velocity.

58
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:50,460
So Baudot why v should be equal to negative ball that y and here as well where I'm going to call our

59
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,520
wall play and we are going to play that.

60
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,570
So let's.

61
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,060
OK, so it comes from here, I'm going to just close that.

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,830
There we go.

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,460
So.

64
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:13,060
See, so I'm sure you can hear that it's very volume is low, but you can hear that.

65
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,430
There we go.

66
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,760
It bounces off and it plays that audio for us, OK?

67
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,430
And it's just doing it again and again and again.

68
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,180
Just going to mute that, and the next thing that I want to do here is whenever.

69
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:41,490
Now, we have detected the collision, we have detected the collision of four, the top by a wall and

70
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,410
the bottom wall, what is the other detection that we need to do, the other detection that we need

71
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:46,730
to do?

72
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,090
As for these paddles, whenever it hits one paddle, it should go to the next.

73
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,110
It should it should go to the other direction.

74
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,300
So if the ball is moving, moving, moving towards the left, it means it's moving towards the negative.

75
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,890
And when it hits this ball, it should reverse its velocity to move to the other part.

76
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,810
Right.

77
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:12,480
So what are we to do as I'm going to come on top of this everything manager function and I'm going to

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,940
say the collision.

79
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,480
Collision detec tion of paddles.

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,370
Function, right?

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,550
So this is going to detect the collision for the paddles and I'm going to create this function.

82
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:42,610
Pottle, I'm going to call it Padel, Kaleigh Koelie Detec Deti deti.

83
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,900
All right, so it's parochially deti paddle collision detection and I'm going to pass and ball and I'm

84
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,220
going to pass and paddle.

85
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,970
Right, so we have two parameters now.

86
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,720
There are a few computations that we need to do here.

87
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,180
And before doing that I'm going to zoom.

88
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,630
And so you really how can I get this paddle.

89
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,410
It doesn't matter.

90
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,780
We are going to get this and we are going to think that both of them are the same.

91
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,370
So we have this paddle right here.

92
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,630
This is the computer paddle, right?

93
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:22,720
It doesn't matter whose paddle this is now when the ball hits it right here in case this is the player

94
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,230
paddle.

95
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:29,890
So the player paddle is when the ball hits it on the right side, the computer paddle is when the ball

96
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,240
hits it on the left side.

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:31,950
Right.

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,140
So whenever we want to we want to find this one out is whenever.

99
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,840
The ball hits it here, the first thing that we need to do is we need to find out that the ball should

100
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,430
head it directly in the center, because based on that center is where we create our angle at which

101
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,800
the ball is going to bounce off.

102
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,020
So if it hits it in the center, we can see that the angle at the center is zero.

103
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,890
And how can we find this out?

104
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,270
We know how can we find the center of this powder?

105
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,580
Right.

106
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,880
It's just going to be the part, the height of the paddle.

107
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,740
So this is.

108
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,630
So the position of the panel plus the height of the panel that is going to give us the bottom of the

109
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,300
panel and the top part of the panel is going to be the Paros y position.

110
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,500
So this is the top part of the panel.

111
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,180
This is the bottom part of the panel.

112
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,059
If you want to find out the with the of the metal point, we just divide the height of the panel by

113
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,270
two.

114
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,010
And that is going to give us the center point.

115
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,030
And then we are going to grab that center point, which is right here.

116
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:44,650
And we are going to we are going to compare it against the center point for the ball.

117
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,960
Now, if I zoom out now you get what the idea is, right?

118
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,890
We just want to compare the ball with the circle.

119
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,200
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to come in these two out.

120
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,270
So our ball is right here and I'm going to zoom in.

121
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,120
So this is our ball, right?

122
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,480
What is the center point?

123
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,580
The center point is right where my mouth is pointing and from the center point all the way to here.

124
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,070
This is the radius from the center point all the way to the left is also the radius from the center

125
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,020
point to the top is the radius from the center point to the bottom is also the radius.

126
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:25,610
So if this ball is to hit the apple, it should head it with its radius.

127
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:25,960
Right?

128
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,700
If the ball should head the R.I panel, it should hit it again with its radius.

129
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,560
If the ball should head the top wall, it should hit it with its radius.

130
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:36,830
Right.

131
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,970
So this is the radius.

132
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,230
If the ball should head the bottom, the bottom wall, it should head it with the radius.

133
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,350
So in all four cases we are going to grab the radius.

134
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,380
So what is the top part?

135
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,610
If we get the if, for example, the ball hits the top of the canvas, what is the top part?

136
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,640
So this is the radius.

137
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,300
All right.

138
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:04,750
And this is this is the type this exactly in the middle is where the Y position of this ball is.

139
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:12,290
If I grab this Y position and subtract from it the radius, we are going to grab the top position of

140
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,740
the ball.

141
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,110
And we are we are going to need that.

142
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,020
I'm just going to convert all this concept into code as well.

143
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,610
So I'm just going to come here.

144
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,930
So I'm going to start with the ball first and I'm going to say ball the top.

145
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,050
So what is the top position of the ball?

146
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,530
The top position of the ball is going to be ball dot.

147
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,280
Come on.

148
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,820
That's why the Y position, if we subtract from it, why subtract?

149
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,250
Because we are moving in the negative direction, the radius.

150
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,400
So you can see in all four directions we are involved with the radius.

151
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,460
So this is going to be the top part.

152
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,690
What about the bottom?

153
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,810
I'm sure you can, you can guess this one out if we are moving towards the bottom and we want to find

154
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,120
out the bottom this distance from here up until here, this is the Y position.

155
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,380
If I add the radius to it, we are going to get this point.

156
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:14,990
So basically we grab the ball that y position and we add it the ball, that radius.

157
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:16,690
Right.

158
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,260
So what about the left and right.

159
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,910
The left and right are going to be the same.

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,340
If it is left, it's going to be negative.

161
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,100
If it is right is going to be positive.

162
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,880
Very simple.

163
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,380
So I'm just going to copy these two.

164
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm going to put it there.

165
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,110
So the first one, let's do the left as opposed to top.

166
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,480
And for the left we have XP.

167
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,700
So I'm just going to grab both of them, put the XP.

168
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,210
So if the X position, if we reduce from that, if we subtract from that the radius, it's going to

169
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:51,170
give us that edge of the balls exposition and for the right if we added the radius.

170
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,260
So when we are moving in this direction, this is the center.

171
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,870
If I added the radius, I'm going to get this side of the ball.

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,720
Why do we need to get these four sides?

173
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,130
One side belongs to the player, the r.i player Parro.

174
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,130
The other side belongs to the EHI player Padel.

175
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,920
The top side belongs to the top wall.

176
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,130
It should bounce off of that.

177
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,910
That's what I mean by it.

178
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,290
The bottom part belongs to the bottom wall, which it should bounce off.

179
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:27,620
We need to grab all these four edges and then we need to compare it with the paddle and then we are

180
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,920
going to do one logical operator, a chain of logical operators, which is going to complete this collision

181
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,910
detection for us.

182
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,370
So now we have successfully grabbed the balls four points.

183
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,430
What about the paddle?

184
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,020
So I don't know why I can see the r.i paddle.

185
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,260
We are going to, we can see this, I'm just going to assume that this is our eye and this is A.I. so

186
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,030
for the r.i what do we have.

187
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,370
We have this top for both of them.

188
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,930
We basically do the same thing.

189
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,500
So for the top of the paddle, what is the top of the paddle.

190
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,180
How can we find this edge.

191
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,510
It's the Y position of the paddle.

192
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,170
All right.

193
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,410
So I'm going to say paddle dart top.

194
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:16,630
Why do we need to find it, because the ball might hit that top part of the powder, right?

195
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:16,840
Right.

196
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,890
So it is going to be partho dot y position.

197
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:22,820
All right.

198
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,020
What is the Paton's bar?

199
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:36,010
So in case for it to for us to be able to get this point, we need to grab the top part and we need

200
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,420
to add the paddles, hide to it, and then we get the bottom part.

201
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,830
Very simple, right?

202
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,410
That Y p plus part of that height, perfect.

203
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,710
What about the left?

204
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,260
The left and right are also simple, so the left of the paddle is going to be the paddles exposition,

205
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,570
the left of the paddle.

206
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,770
I'm going to say paddle.

207
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,970
The left is going to be.

208
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,620
Paddle.

209
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,410
Come on, paddle dart exposition.

210
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,090
And what about the right of the paddle for the right of the paddle?

211
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,750
We need to grab the exposition and add to it the width of the paddle as opposed to height of the paddle

212
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,460
as opposed to the height of the paddle.

213
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,080
So paddle to it.

214
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,470
Sorry.

215
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,400
Ah, right.

216
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,500
Should be paddle.

217
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,460
Dart exposition, plus the width of the paddle.

218
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,300
Dot with.

219
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,530
Perfect.

220
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:50,890
Now, we have successfully grabbed all four edges of the paddle and all four outer edges of the circle

221
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,190
as well.

222
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,900
Now we need to compare it.

223
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,580
Comparison comparison is going to be easy.

224
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,280
So we are going to see a return if the ball's right position.

225
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,870
Right position is greater than the paddles left position, the ball should bounce off.

226
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,520
And so this is changing logical operators, the ball's bottom.

227
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,670
A position if it is greater than the the paddles.

228
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:31,890
Paddles, top position, the ball should bounce off and then we are going to say if the balls return,

229
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,700
if the ball is left, position is less than the paddles.

230
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,240
Less than the paddles, right position.

231
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:52,180
Right, and also return true, if the balls are right, position is also less than.

232
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:02,550
I think I made a mistake, we have already done that, so this is the panel's bottom.

233
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,770
So we did the balls, right?

234
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,340
Should be greater than the paddles.

235
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,270
The left should be greater than that.

236
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,790
The ball's bottom should be greater than the paddle.

237
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,040
Stop the balls left.

238
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:24,820
All right, the most left part of the bombs left should be less than the paddles, right?

239
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:33,790
And the ball's top we have in the top right, the box tops should be less than the paddles, but.

240
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,870
Let's save it.

241
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:42,980
There we go, it rearranges it better so the right hand side of the ball should be greater than the

242
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,470
left hand side of the paddle for it to bounce off.

243
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,270
What does that mean?

244
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,340
It means that if.

245
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,600
OK, come on.

246
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:59,040
So if this this side of the ball is greater than this side of the paddle, it should bounce off if it

247
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,850
is not greater than that.

248
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:08,550
And if we don't do it this way, what would happen this side of the ball if it gets greater than the

249
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,109
left side of the paddle?

250
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,700
And it doesn't bounce off, it would cross the paddle.

251
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,560
We won't have any detection, so it shouldn't cross it.

252
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,410
It means it shouldn't get bigger than that.

253
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:27,930
So that's the first scenario for the second scenario we have if the bonds bottom is greater than the

254
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,640
ball and the paddle top.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,290
Right.

256
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,830
So let's say that the ball this this is the bottom.

257
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,610
Now the bottom of the ball is going to have the same idea for the r.i paddle and for the paddle.

258
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:50,460
So if the bottom of the ball hits the top of the paddle and the bottom of the ball is greater than that.

259
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,200
Right.

260
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,560
If it is greater, if it isn't greater than that, it is not going to bounce off.

261
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,740
If it is greater than that.

262
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,590
That's right.

263
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,760
At the point that we want it to bounce off.

264
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,810
So for example, the ball is coming from the ball.

265
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,900
It is coming in this way, coming, coming, coming right here and then in here.

266
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,220
The ball's bottom is not bigger than the paddle stop.

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,370
It should reach it and then we should compare it.

268
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,940
Otherwise, when it gets to here, then it would bounce off.

269
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:31,050
We need we need them to touch and to establish this relationship that says the ball bonds bottom is

270
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:37,020
going to get to is going to get to a point where it is greater than the paddle stop and then the ball

271
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,730
would penetrate this paddle.

272
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:46,400
And right at the point of penetration is where we want it to bounce back, bounce back.

273
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,500
So this top and the bottom, they basically work in the same way.

274
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,510
For this hour, I paddle and the paddle.

275
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,950
And right here, this is for the ah paddle.

276
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,280
We say that the ball's left should be less than the right way.

277
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,550
We say less than because we are moving in the negative direction.

278
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,090
And for this why we say bottom less than because we are moving in the negative direction.

279
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,300
Keep in mind the for the bottom of the ball to head the top of the paddle, the ball should come in

280
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,110
this direction.

281
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,260
The ball should come from top to bottom.

282
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,610
And that is positive direction for the top of the ball to head the bottom of the paddle.

283
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,340
The ball should move in this direction.

284
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,540
See, boom.

285
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,110
Like that.

286
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,980
Like that.

287
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,130
And this is towards the negative direction.

288
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,780
That's why we see less than that.

289
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:51,180
And with this with very this, we can detect the ball from the edges of that as well.

290
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,150
And now what I'm going to do here is we need to call.

291
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,060
We don't have of course, this is not going to work.

292
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,520
And I know I know you know that as well.

293
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,960
We are going to make it work.

294
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,190
We just provided the logic, the actual know how we are going to do it in our next lecture because we

295
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:15,150
need to call this paddle collie Collie ditty inside our everything manager, because this everything

296
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,590
manager handles that.

297
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:22,260
And then we call the everything manager within the hour game in it, which runs 60 times per second.

298
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,300
So you need to keep that in mind.

299
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,300
Even though we have our detection, what do we do after that?

300
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,180
So we have detected where the ball hits the paddle.

301
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,650
What do we do after that?

302
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,930
We want to reverse the velocity.

303
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,060
We want to change the position.

304
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,630
Right.

305
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,680
We want to create a like a coin toss situation.

306
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,850
So all of that hopefully we are going to cover in our next lecture.

307
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,320
See you guys then.
