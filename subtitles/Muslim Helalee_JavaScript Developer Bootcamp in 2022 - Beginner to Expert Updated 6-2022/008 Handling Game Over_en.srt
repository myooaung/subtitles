1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:10,210
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we will handle game over our ride along with when the game is over,

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,890
we will like to print a text as well to just show which player has won and Tulsa restarted the game.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,580
Also show whether if there is a tie or not and all these sort of things.

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,390
So first off, we have created over time and right here.

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,110
So what are we going to do as I'm going to keep that one open and we are going to go to our new game

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,800
and inside our new game right down here, I'm going to grab our time in and I'm going to set it to zero.

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,470
So initially it is going to be zero and.

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,800
What we are going to do is where did we handle that logic?

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,190
So in our select site, we we put something think handle game over.

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,780
So in here, what we would like to do is.

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,720
We would like to check F now f the score, r.i, plus the score I.

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:19,660
If Score II, if both of them are equal to the grid size times, the grid size now grid size, it means

13
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,900
that the number of rows, number of columns score score, it means that the game is over.

14
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,840
Like the both of the scores.

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,950
They are equal to the size of the grid.

16
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,210
There is no more score for any of them to grab.

17
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,390
Then we are going to say the time end is going to be equal to math.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,670
Dot, dot, seal.

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,540
So it is going to give us a whole integer returns, the smallest integer greater than or equal to its

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,710
numeric argument.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,320
And we are going to pass an hour delay and in here times the FPS.

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,200
So if the FPS is thirty, it is going to take two seconds.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,820
If the FBI says 60, it is still going to take two seconds because the FBI should be based on frames

24
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,970
per second of your refresh rate screen.

25
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,150
So go ahead and check that out first and then pass.

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,350
And for me, it's 60.

27
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,280
So I'm just going to go ahead.

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,590
I'm going to pass in 60 in here.

29
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,020
And basically we want to do that.

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,310
So next stop, let's go ahead and let's actually draw this.

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,880
So I'm going to collapse this square thing, the entire thing.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm going to collapse this site and I'm going to collapse the new game.

33
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:42,430
And here is where we are going to do our logic, so we are going to say game over text, we need to

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,150
show that right.

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,610
So we are going to say if time end is greater than zero, it means that the time is not ended.

36
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,530
We are going to decrement it by one.

37
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,090
Right.

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,400
It means that we are in the game over.

39
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,570
Now, first off, let's go ahead and let's handle a tie when there is a tie there.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,020
Right.

41
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,610
And.

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,660
If when do we have a tie when this core of R.I equals the score of A.I., very simple, right?

43
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,030
When when these two scores, they are the same, it means that it is a tie.

44
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:20,830
All right.

45
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,490
So for that, which one should I grow?

46
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,080
I could either of those.

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,830
I'm just going to put it right here and I'm going to save it.

48
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,820
So what is the text?

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,210
The text is going to be text Ty.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,410
Perfect, what is going to be the with the with is going to be zero point five, the exposition, the

51
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,350
Y position is going to be margin zero point six, the color is going to be colored tie.

52
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,780
So we do have a color for that as well.

53
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,240
And the text size is going to be that.

54
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,300
So this is going to handle a tie for us.

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
So let's go ahead and let's check it out.

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:08,870
All right, so if I put in that there and I should give the other user the edge of, I don't think I

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,560
can, so I'm just going to put it there for there.

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,150
So this is not going to be a tie.

59
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,650
So let's try this again.

60
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,620
Right.

61
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,690
So this is that user and then it's this user.

62
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,150
Put one there and one here.

63
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,020
It is this user and this should be there we go.

64
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,770
It says draw.

65
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:28,790
Right.

66
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,200
And you can see that the draw went away after exactly two seconds, but our game did not our game did

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
not restart.

68
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,780
We are going to handle that as well.

69
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,040
So if it is a tie, what if it is not a tie?

70
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,660
If it is not a tie?

71
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,830
We need to make sure.

72
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,140
We need to find out which player.

73
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,620
Players when which player has one player's player wins?

74
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,630
Right player wins if they score.

75
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,120
Of the first player is greater than the score of the second player.

76
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,830
Let's go ahead and let's check the color as well.

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,780
This is going to return a boolean if then if you hover over it, you can see that it says Boolean and.

78
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,840
And if this boolean is true, it means that player one is one, if this boolean is not true, it means

79
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,090
that players two has one.

80
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,410
Let's grab the color as well based on that boolean.

81
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,890
So we are going to say if players turn, if Flair's wins, it's true.

82
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,780
It means that the first player has won.

83
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,050
Right.

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,990
And we need to show the color for that.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,500
So color of player, if it is not true, if player wins is false, it means that the A.I. has won.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,550
So we are going to show the color for the.

87
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
A perfect.

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
And what about the text should I mean, we should show the text as well, right?

89
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:07,110
So we are going to say if player wins is true, it means that the player won, a.k.a. r.i has won and

90
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,660
we are going to show the text player.

91
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:17,910
Otherwise it means that the RIAA, a.k.a. player one has not won and the AK player too has won.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,430
And we are going to show the text for that.

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,600
Perfect.

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,930
And finally, let's actually draw this so we could grab any of these.

95
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,810
I'm going to grab this one and I'm going to put it right here.

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,430
Save it.

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,540
So what is going to be the text?

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,570
The text is going to be the text.

99
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,860
The weather is going to be zero point five margin is going to be zero point seven, the color is going

100
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,460
to be the color that we have just passed, we have just created there.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,840
The text size is going to be text size top.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,920
So this is going to be the text and let's actually grab and pass.

103
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,540
And the text went as well.

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:07,630
So where is text when the with the same the margin for this.

105
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm going to put it a five.

106
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,230
This is going to show us which player it is, but we need to say that PLAYER one, this is going to

107
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,230
give us that one one text and it should be below this.

108
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,980
That's why the margin is bigger.

109
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,880
The color is the color.

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,010
The size is that.

111
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,490
So if.

112
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:38,850
And also after this, we are handling it and and the statement we are handling, whichever which player

113
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,770
has won, we need to reset the game as well.

114
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,350
So start a new game, so start a new game.

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,120
And with this, hopefully our project is going to work and it is going to come to an end.

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:01,270
Now, if it is equal to zero, it means that the game has ended, it is greater than zero.

117
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,330
We are going to decrease it until the game ends.

118
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,390
And when the game ends, we are going to call a new game.

119
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,820
All right, so I'm going to play it with this player once, and you could go ahead and you could play

120
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,560
it with the great size 10.

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,110
I'm just going to check it here.

122
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,660
And PLAYER one.

123
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,930
First off, let's check for a draw that's player two, and this is going to be.

124
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,470
Oh, this is going to be so it says player one one and you can see the game reset.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
So now let's give player to the win.

126
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,440
Right and pleasure to.

127
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,170
So it says player to one and the score was three.

128
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,320
Let's let's try to grab a draw.

129
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,690
So I'm going to try to do this randomly, so.

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,490
This is going to be a draw.

131
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:10,040
OK, so oh, so if I put it here, I can grab that and that and it's going to say draw and then the

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
game is going to restart.

133
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,900
And each time you can see that it is random, which players turn, it is the player's turn is always

134
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,770
going to be right.

135
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,990
So it is player one.

136
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,050
Players to.

137
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:33,200
Player one again, one, two, one, one, one, two, and basically it's random.

138
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:40,540
So the final thing that I would like to do is I would like to set the grid size to turn.

139
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,910
So everything looks cool here.

140
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,130
I'm going to close this game that we have.

141
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,690
So this is the game that we built.

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,030
Just refresh the page and start playing.

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,380
So now you can play with another player.

144
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,130
So player one.

145
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,730
Player two.

146
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:04,390
In our next game, we will be changing the text to A.I. and our computer, what we had and we will be

147
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,720
automating the computer.

148
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,220
Right.

149
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,130
So whenever I put a line here, the computer will think and will come up with another line, for example,

150
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,240
here or here.

151
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,910
And then we will have, like I think I can call it, like a smart AI that is going to be smart AI and

152
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,060
it is going to be a little bit challenging to play against that A.I. It's going to be somewhat like

153
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:39,280
the A.I. that we created for a Kinect for game, but way smarter than the one that we created for the

154
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,670
Pong.

155
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,870
I mean, the Pong II was really smart, but we had to dumb it down.

156
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,980
So that's it for this chapter and for this project.

157
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,510
See you guys in the next one.
