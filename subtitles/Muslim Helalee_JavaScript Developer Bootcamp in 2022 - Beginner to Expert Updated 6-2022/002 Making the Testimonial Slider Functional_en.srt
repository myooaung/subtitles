00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,690
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,540
In this lecture, we are going to implement the functionality of our testimony on Schlyter.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,760
All right, so first things first, what is it that we need to grab?

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,610
We're going to grab all of our slides and all of our indicator images.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:24,890
So this these texts, there are slides and these images, there are indicator images and basically that's

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,090
it.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,900
That's the only thing that we need to grow.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,200
So I'm going to say consed I'm going to call this variable slides and we're going to say document that

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
query selecter.

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:44,360
And we are going to grab this later, right, but we don't want the slider itself, we want the children

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,790
of the slider, right.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,540
So let's say let's calm down.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,270
And the next thing that I want to grab is.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,810
It's going to be indicator images indicator IMGs and you're going to say document that query selector

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:09,150
and we are going to grab the indicator and inside the indicator we have the images.

16
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,310
So we are going to grab all the children of the indicator.

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,690
That said, these are basically the two things that we needed to grow.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm just going to go ahead and make this model smaller so we can increase the width of this one, just

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,320
maybe like a bit more.

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,600
And come right there.

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,350
All right, so the first thing that I want to do is I want to loop over this.

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,810
I want to loop over the indicator images and we are going to use our regular loops here.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,180
All right.

24
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,100
So I'm going to say for that, I'm going to use iut first.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,670
We want the AI to start from zero and we want the AI to go all the way to indicator imagist length.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,910
And from this, you guys you guys know that length is a method, is a property of an array.

27
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,470
We can use it on an array.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,860
And this is going to give us an array.

29
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,230
Right.

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,940
This constant variable is going to give us an array.

31
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,120
That's why we can access the length property.

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,280
All right, and we want to each time we want incremented by one.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,300
All right, so in here, what I want to do is I want to add an average listener for the indicator images.

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,610
And this for loops for loop allows us to repeat this at event listener three times or as many times

35
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,920
as we have images.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,820
So I'm going to say indicator images and we are going to grab the loop variable and we are going to

37
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,110
say add event listener.

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,110
So this is a new way of adding giving listeners.

39
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,780
And let's provide and say quotes, and then we are going to run a function.

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,020
So what is the function going to do?

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,310
We want this function to do two things first, we want to grab the indicator images and we want to remove

42
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,240
the active class to be able to add it later.

43
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,210
And the second thing is we want to grab our slides and remove the active class if if any of the slides

44
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,580
have it to be able to add it later.

45
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,190
Right.

46
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,440
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to come down and I'm going to create another forum for Loop.

47
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,310
This time I'm going to call the loop variable J.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,770
Right.

49
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,670
I'm going to say let J equal to zero.

50
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:34,120
We want it to start from zero and we want the J to go all the way to indicator images dot length.

51
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,020
All right.

52
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:43,840
And we want to incriminate each time by one, so each time when we click, when we click any of these

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,710
indicator images, this loop is going to run, this loop is going to only run whenever we click any

54
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,120
of these indicator images.

55
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,850
And we are going to grab our indicator images and we are going to pass in the loop variable and we say

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,780
classless.

57
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:07,570
So I want this this loop variable j to go ahead and search inside this indicator images and find the

58
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:14,170
class of active and remove it from any of the indicator images that currently have this.

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,060
So whenever it removes the class, what do I want to do?

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:27,400
I want to add it to the loop variable of the eye and the loop variable of the eye is the loop variable

61
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,690
that we have just clicked.

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,260
Right.

63
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:41,030
So indicator images I that class list, so first we make sure that the class active is removed from

64
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:47,420
every every from every other, like from all of the indicator images, then we add it.

65
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,900
Right.

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
First off, we just make sure that it is removed and then we add it.

67
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,550
Right.

68
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,570
So now let's save it.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,320
Let's click.

70
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,070
And then you guys can see now we do get our effect, the images they're switching, but the text is

71
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,270
still staying the same.

72
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
So the first part of this functionality is done.

73
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,790
The second part of this functionality is to get the slides.

74
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,820
So I'm going to create a constant I'm going to call it ID.

75
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,520
And this is where the data I'd attribute comes in.

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,410
And I'm going to say indicator images and I'm going to say I we just use our Adjaye loop.

77
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:30,740
I'm just going to call a loop just to make sure that we have removed this the class of active from any

78
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,880
indicator images.

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,770
And then we just added it here.

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,190
Right.

81
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,080
So this is for safety purposes.

82
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,360
All right.

83
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,400
We don't want to add this class to this.

84
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,540
We just want to add it once.

85
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,540
So we remove it from any element that has it.

86
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,710
And then we re added.

87
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,040
All right, so we go ahead and we grab our indicator images which are over, which are the children

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,720
of the indicator, and we get the attribute, what is the attribute that we get?

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,870
It is the data data dash I'd attribute that we want to get.

90
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,760
Now, we have grabbed the data.

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,060
It is value which are zero one and two.

92
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,590
What do we want to do with that?

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,830
We want to loop over them as well.

94
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,760
So we are going to say let OK, we start from zero.

95
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,280
The reason that it starts from zero is the first data ID value is actually zero.

96
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,560
And we are going to say, go, Kay goes all the way to slide's.

97
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,480
That length and we have created the slides.

98
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
OK, now this is not accurate.

99
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,940
That's correct.

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,640
And it's based right here.

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,580
We have created the slides variable right here.

102
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:49,030
You're going to access it and we are going to say go all the way to slides that length, less than that.

103
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,670
And each time we are going to implement, we are going to increment the Lutherville variable by one.

104
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,010
And what do we want it to do?

105
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:04,780
We want to grab our slides, passing the variable, and we want to make sure that none of them have

106
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,940
the class of active.

107
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,810
And when none of them have the class of active, the last thing that we want to do here is we want to

108
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,470
add it.

109
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,250
We want to have this class of active, classless and.

110
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,130
It let's go over this concept one more time.

111
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,670
First, let's check it if it works, if I click on it.

112
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:38,900
OK, now here we should pass the I.D. because this constant of I.D. grabs the value for this data I.D.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,700
So it's going to be zero then.

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,670
It's going to be one that is going to be two.

115
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,700
So let's save it.

116
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,190
Let's click on this and let's click on this.

117
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,140
So it definitely works, but let's go over this concept one more time.

118
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,330
So we created a loop because we want to repeat our event listener three times inside the event, listeners

119
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,920
function.

120
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,720
First off, we check that we don't have this active clause.

121
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,920
If we have it will remove it by looping over the indicator images.

122
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:13,400
And also we check for that active clause inside our slides by looping over the slides.

123
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,240
Right.

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,950
And whatever that that is done, we whenever that is done and we have clicked on any of these indicators,

125
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,830
we want to add the active clause to that indicator and the active class is going to be added from here.

126
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,179
So this is the active clause for the indicator of images.

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,559
And we are also going to the active clashed our slides as well.

128
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,370
All right.

129
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,360
So whenever we click first, we check whether the removed remove classes there, if it is there to remove

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,510
it.

131
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,630
And then we added to the item that we have clicked and we also check for the slides.

132
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,080
If there is the active class and if it is there, we remove it.

133
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,260
And then we added to that specific slide that we want to see.

134
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,480
All right.

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,760
And the active class for slides comes from right here.

136
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,220
So we have selected all the slides and we have said display none.

137
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,550
But on the on the first slide, which is.

138
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,870
OK, so this is the first slide slide number one seats.

139
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm just going to collapse two and three seats on slide number one.

140
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:28,170
We have added the active clause, but in here, we we want to remove that active clause from there and

141
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,680
we want to add it to any slide that we click on it.

142
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,730
All right.

143
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,970
And this is how this project works.

144
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,370
That said for this, let's see you guys in the next one.
