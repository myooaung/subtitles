00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,530
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we're going to delete listed superheros.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,860
All right, so this is the part where I'm going to tell you, if you don't want to use font awesome

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,340
icons and if you if you wanna use anything else, how you can still make it work and how you can still

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,580
make the deletion process complete.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:23,510
Right.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,440
So first off, for example, if you want to use a simple anchor tag or if you want to use anything,

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,920
just make sure you add it here and give it like a class to because we are going to grab it by the class

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,990
and then do some dumb traversing and then we are going to delete it.

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,310
All right.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,460
So make sure you give it a specific class as far as the eye, the item, the e-mail element itself is

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,210
concerned.

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,530
It doesn't really matter what you use.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,650
So just put it right here.

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,750
Just make sure it's in the correct format.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:05,540
And once that happens, what we are going to do is we are going to now because we want to grab the listed

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,130
item.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,770
So if I just go ahead and take a look at that, what that is.

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,620
So let me grab this.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,670
Let's just click here.

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,040
So now we are in here.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,400
All right.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:24,710
So now you can see that inside this class, which we have created in inside this div, we have a will

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,840
and inside the other we have this icon.

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,530
All right.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,570
And excuse me.

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,710
And this icon is generated dynamically.

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,680
So this is going to make our work a little bit trickier to grab it, because if it were directly inside

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,390
the HTML, that would have been easier.

29
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,580
But because it isn't done that way, it makes our work a little bit trickier.

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,270
So first off, we are going to grab the parent, which is which we are just going to call it less data.

31
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,670
And if you remember, we have also selected that.

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,360
So this is actually the parent.

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,620
So I could just grab it from there and put it right here.

34
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:04,640
Right.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,870
And we are going to sell this data that add event listeners that add a wellness center.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,850
We are listening for a click and when the click happens, we want to run a certain function.

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,230
Now, first off, let's go ahead and let's take a look at that e that event object associated with this

38
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:24,680
click.

39
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:33,650
So now if I add superheros here and if I go to the console and if I click, you can see that we get

40
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,820
all this information.

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,470
Now we want to trace back to this trash.

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:48,530
So if I were to go inside the target and from Target, if I go inside the class name, you can see that

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,460
we get that specific class name.

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,690
That's why I told you guys give it a specific class name.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,490
You can provided a specific IED name.

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,460
You can't do it that way as well.

47
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,230
But I'm going to do it.

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,230
So we are going to grab this.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,860
So it was inside Iida Target that Klausner ads copy this class name.

50
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,560
Let's come here.

51
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:17,860
So f if the thing that you know what, I'm just going to store it inside of inside a variable.

52
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,840
So we are going to say f the thing.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:31,020
Which is e that we have hopes if the thing that we have clicked on, come on, we have clicked on has

54
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,920
a class.

55
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:41,050
Name, which is equal to this, what do we want to do so we want to implement this whenever we have

56
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:47,320
specifically clicked on that icon, we don't want to remove that entire list.

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,290
When that entire superheroine we click on the for example, the name of the superhero or the universe,

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,550
we want to remove it whenever we have clicked on it.

59
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,870
So if the thing that we have clicked on has a class of this that we have inserted, then let's go ahead

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,650
and let's store this class because we are going to use it.

61
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,580
So consed, I'm just going to call it trash and I'm going to put it.

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,340
Now what is that.

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:25,120
OK, so we have so the thing that we have clicked on, if it has a class of trash this class, if has,

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,820
if it has this class, what do we want to do with it now before doing anything with that, I want to

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,290
consult something.

66
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,560
Now I know I told you guys that we are going to keep it under five minutes, but for this particular

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,190
situation, I'm not I don't think that it's a good idea because we are actually in the middle of something

68
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,420
and it's not finished.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,830
And I don't want to interrupt the I don't want to ruin the continuity of this lecture.

70
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,580
So we are going to keep going.

71
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,670
So now what I want to do is.

72
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,240
Actually go over the idea.

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:05,870
So now we have successfully grabbed that Troche icon, and when we click on that Troche icon, what

74
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,980
is it that we really what is it that we want to delete?

75
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,780
So let's let's take a closer look at that.

76
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,770
So when I click on it, you know what?

77
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,280
We are going to go and check it out here.

78
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,910
So inside the e-mail, it's my way better.

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,210
So what is it that we want to click?

80
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,520
Sorry, we want to remove for that to work perfectly fine.

81
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,220
We need to have more than one variable, more than one item.

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,700
So now we can see that each item actually is housed within one year.

83
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,590
Well, that's how I intended it to be.

84
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:49,580
So if I want to remove this superhero Superman, I need to remove the entire well, if I want to remove

85
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,620
Rockit, I need to remove the you for the rocket.

86
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,130
So I hope you're following this is how we intended to create it.

87
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,940
So this is the icon we have successfully traced our icon to here.

88
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,390
So when I click on this, I want to go one level up and I want to remove that level up.

89
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,370
That level off is either called parent node or parent element.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,990
Either way, it works fine.

91
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,910
But I'm going to use Paran note.

92
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,620
I think it sounds cooler.

93
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,550
So if I were to now click on it.

94
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,400
So if I come here and if I click on it, let's remove this and let's click on it.

95
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,060
We get this event fire.

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,240
So when this event fires, so we want to grab the target's parent.

97
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,840
So either target.

98
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,700
This is the target.

99
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,010
What is the parent node of that target?

100
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,670
And we want to remove that.

101
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,410
So if I come into here so you can see that we get the you see, so it doesn't matter if you say that

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,090
parent element or dot parent note, both of them return the same thing.

103
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,200
And if you open them, they are going to have the same almost the same properties and functions on them.

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:10,640
So if I say e da target, dot parent node, what do you think it is going to give us?

105
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,980
It is going to give us the USA.

106
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,370
And that's exactly what we want to delete.

107
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,660
See.

108
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,800
So in order to delete a complete superhero, because all these list items are actually housed within

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,190
this, well, we need to delete that specific user.

110
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,960
Right, so things are getting easy, so now I'm going to grab this and I'm going to delete this console

111
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,310
log and I'm going to say const trash.

112
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:48,760
This very simple, we want to trust that, and now we are going to say trash, there is a method called

113
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,330
remove.

114
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,460
Simple, very, very simple stuff here.

115
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,780
So now let's say Superman, DC and fly, let's save it.

116
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,870
So now when I click on this, so if I click here, nothing happens, right.

117
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,340
And I'm going to log to the console something.

118
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,740
Oops.

119
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,690
Uh.

120
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,960
Deletion success, I want to log this to the council as well.

121
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,040
So now let's create our SUPAMAN.

122
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:29,390
And so it doesn't matter where you click, as long as you click on something that has a class of ASFA

123
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,930
trash.

124
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,260
So when you click on it, you can see that the superhero is deleted.

125
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,299
It no longer exists in here.

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,280
And it says deletion success.

127
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,260
And if you come to the HTML.

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,640
And if we come to the last to the less detail, you can see that it is empty.

129
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,850
There is no arrow next to it.

130
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,480
It's empty because that superhero was deleted.

131
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,140
Now.

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,980
As far as the deletion of the superheros are concerned, we are done all right.

133
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,620
So we are done with the process of deleting them.

134
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:11,000
However, we are going to come back to this code because when we implement our local storage, we want

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,170
when we delete that, when we head that trash icon not only deleted from the UI, but also deleted from

136
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,390
the local storage and also update the local storage, tell the local storage.

137
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,450
I just deleted this item.

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,770
So go ahead, delete it from there as well.

139
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,920
So.

140
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,450
That's what we are going to do in the next few lectures as far as the application itself is concerned,

141
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,360
if you're not really if you don't really care about their local storage, we are done with this application.

142
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,340
But I do care about local storage.

143
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,340
And I think we need to at least have some idea of how we can store something somewhere.

144
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,050
Right, until we get to, like, complicated stuff.

145
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:56,980
Right.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,150
So what I'm going to do is starting our next series of lectures because we are effectively done with

147
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,510
this.

148
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:13,050
We are going to start working with the local storage and the store superhero class.

149
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,380
So that's it for this lecture.

150
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,920
See you guys in the next one.
