00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:08.200
Hi, everyone, welcome to the second part of implementing a key Prust functionality.

2
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.790
All right, so we know that when we pressed the etch key, we got a negative one.

3
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.080
How do we know that?

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.850
We have pressed the key.

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.780
We could consider log that as well.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.090
And now you guys know why we use consider log so much, because we are testing our application and also

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.840
our knowledge.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.960
All right, apparently so let's click there and save it and click here.

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.390
And now let's go ahead and Pliss why?

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.290
And I guess you can see this is why and in return is negative one.

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.980
Why?

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.040
Does it return a negative one now, whenever you want to find you want to find the index of any item

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.330
inside an array?

14
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.150
You're going to find it using this method that says index of right.

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.769
So whenever you cannot find the index or whenever you're looking, let me rephrase it.

16
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:13.270
Whenever you're looking for an item that does not exist in your array, the index of that item is always

17
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.380
going to be minus one.

18
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.940
But that is inaccurate.

19
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.000
It is going to return minus one because minus one is return when something is not found.

20
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.900
Right.

21
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.280
So this index is not found.

22
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.000
That's why it returns minus one.

23
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.840
It doesn't mean that this is the index of why.

24
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.470
No, no, no.

25
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.150
If I were to come here and click e it is going to return minus one or T every time.

26
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.970
It doesn't matter.

27
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.170
It is going to return minus one because none of these keys.

28
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.810
Is actually inside this this array, whenever the key is not inside that array, it is going to return

29
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.350
minus one.

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.590
We are going to use this minus one logic as our final piece of this program, this project or Web application.

31
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.610
All right.

32
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.080
So now let's go ahead and press something that is inside this array.

33
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.970
So let's proceed.

34
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.850
We are going to get the index of zero shocker.

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.280
Of course, it is zero.

36
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.780
That's Press V. So the index of V should be zero one, two, three.

37
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.060
So we should get three.

38
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.180
So let's press V, we get three.

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.270
So now we can see that this works.

40
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.380
We could say Trish this and XXVI B in M zero one, two, three, four, five and six.

41
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.840
So we have successfully grabbed the indices of the white keys.

42
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.600
The same thing goes for the Black Keys.

43
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.360
So I don't have to like explain it again so we could just go ahead and test it.

44
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.600
And in here I'm just going to pass in black.

45
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.270
All right.

46
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.090
Right, so let's process.

47
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.670
Block.

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.020
K, this is all capital.

49
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.350
My key is not defined, so cool, so cool.

50
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.550
All right, so now let's play what is up here.

51
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.210
Black is right.

52
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.390
Let's press as we get zero D, we get one G to each three and four.

53
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.220
And if I were to press, okay, we are going to get minus one.

54
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.140
It is not there.

55
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.080
So now let's go ahead and let's remove these and let's remove these line breaks.

56
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.320
All right, all right, so now we are we are getting close, and for our final piece, we are going

57
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.420
to implement an if statement and we are going to say if the white key index is greater than minus one

58
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.860
and I'm going to explain that, then run the plane out function and the plane of function has a parameter.

59
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.860
So we should in the function call pattern and argument, the argument is going to be white keys.

60
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.560
And where is this white keys?

61
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.490
It is this that we have selected in there and the white keys.

62
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.890
We do not want all of them to be played.

63
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.170
We want a certain white key to be played.

64
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.900
And where do we grab that certain white key?

65
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.070
We grab it using this index, which we have just found.

66
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.560
Let's save it.

67
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.350
Let's click.

68
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.420
Perfect.

69
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.170
All right.

70
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.660
Now, the clicking worked before as well.

71
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.640
So now let's click on the zip.

72
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.450
It works.

73
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.580
We could map them as well.

74
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.760
We could take a look at them in here as well.

75
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.280
We could just say key.

76
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.480
I don't know, like key.

77
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.230
So if I click we get X, CVB and M.

78
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.070
All right.

79
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.750
So now we are clicking those.

80
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.730
All right.

81
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.400
So what does the statement says if the white key index is greater than minus one?

82
00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:02.080
So, you know, we have this like coordinates where we have minus two, minus one, then we have zero,

83
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.940
then we have one, then we have two, then we have three.

84
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.250
Now this is the number of coordinates.

85
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.870
So what is greater than minus one.

86
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.960
The greater than minus one is zero.

87
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.870
And what is zero in this context?

88
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.180
Zero is the index of the first item inside this array.

89
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.510
So whenever the white key index is greater than one, then we call the play function playing out function.

90
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.310
And I hope that is clearer now.

91
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.560
Whenever we get a value which is greater than minus one, we get to play this piano.

92
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.520
All right.

93
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.530
If it is not greater than minus one, we do not play this piano.

94
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.580
What does that mean?

95
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.300
We get minus one whenever we play a key that is not inside this array.

96
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.030
For example, if I click there and if I press like the A key, we are going to get the arc.

97
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.470
But the arc, he doesn't play this piano because it's not included in here.

98
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.000
And how do we know that?

99
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.760
Because it is going to return negative one.

100
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.170
And this if statement is not going to run this play note function.

101
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.270
This is why if statements are cause the like controlling the logic flow or the flow of the logic of

102
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.320
the program, that's why if statements are a crucial part of any programming language and when it is

103
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:30.250
greater than minus one, it means either it's zero, it's one, it's two or whatever, then we get to

104
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.210
play this piano.

105
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:39.670
So now if I click on Z, Z has an index of what it has an index of zero from this area and zero is greater

106
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.740
than one, a greater than minus one.

107
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.980
And this if statement holds true and when it holds true, then we get to play the piano.

108
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.980
Right now the White Keys is done.

109
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.270
What about the Black Keys?

110
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.490
So we are going to say the white key and I'm just going to grab all of them and I'm going to change

111
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.210
them with black.

112
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.400
So let's click on this.

113
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.800
It is going to play or not claque.

114
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.150
Of course, let's say it doesn't play as place D plays.

115
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.490
F doesn't play G plays H plays J Place K does not play.

116
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.200
So this is how this works.

117
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.480
I'm going to go over this syntax one more time.

118
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:25.360
If the index that we have find sorry if the index that we have found is greater than minus one and minus

119
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.870
one is returned, whenever that specific key that we have entered inside this array is not played is

120
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.230
not pressed when the index which is found is greater than minus one, then we play the piano.

121
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:45.640
When the index is less than minus one, we do not play the piano, and in which case it is less than

122
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.300
minus one.

123
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.070
In the case that none of these keys has been pressed.

124
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.630
So I can show you this in a better way as well, how this actually works.

125
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.400
So let's go ahead and comment that out in front.

126
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.000
And I'm just going to grab one.

127
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.350
Come on, buddy.

128
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.070
What am I doing?

129
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.540
Give it to me.

130
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.480
Give it to me.

131
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:13.620
All right, so so let's instead of playing, let's do something else, let's say.

132
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.630
I'm just going to say return true, right?

133
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.830
Let's do that and let's go Tanzy.

134
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.640
It is going to return to it is going to return the zek.

135
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.210
Okay, that's canceled unless you do that.

136
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.440
And that's Klick.

137
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.740
It doesn't do anything, so let's do some sort of calculation.

138
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.929
So consider log, let's say two plus two.

139
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:46.670
So now whenever the Black Keys oh, it is the black index, the black index is greater than minus one,

140
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.060
we are going to run to the cost of two plus two.

141
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:55.100
So if I click on this, it is going to run two plus two because this condition holds true.

142
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.030
And when this condition holds true, the piano is going to play.

143
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.310
What if I click on another key?

144
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.390
So let's save it.

145
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.470
Let's do it one more time.

146
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:09.320
So if I click on S, it is going to run that because X is included inside this array so that this condition

147
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.930
holds true.

148
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.200
What if this condition does not hold true?

149
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.290
So we should not see anything inside the concert.

150
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.630
Right.

151
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.540
So if I click on the E, we don't see anything inside the console because this condition is not true.

152
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.740
The code does not run.

153
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.540
That's it.

154
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.220
That's how simple it is.

155
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.090
So let's get these guys in and save them and let's go full screen.

156
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.990
And now that's X CVB in M and SD g h i.

157
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:45.220
If I click on any other key, I'm sure you can hear it is not going to play anything.

158
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.090
So go ahead, play it note and enjoy it.

159
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.940
That's it for this.

160
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.130
Let's see you guys in the next one.
