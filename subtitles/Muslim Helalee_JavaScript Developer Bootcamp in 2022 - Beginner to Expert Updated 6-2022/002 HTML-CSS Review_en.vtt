00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.880
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.810
In this next year, we will go over the XHTML and see assess for this project.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.230
All right, so in this e-mail, we have a div with a class of rapper that is going to wrap around an

4
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.110
entire game and then we have three main children for that.

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.860
One is going to be the one that says tic tac toe.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.450
And this text is actually the text that is going to change based on the player.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.200
Then we have our board exactly inside the board.

8
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:43.360
We have nine diffs with the shared class of box and within with a different ID for each of them, starting

9
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.920
at zero because this is going to be converted into an array.

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.550
So we want the IDs to act as though their array indices.

11
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.740
And finally, we have our button that's going to restart everything.

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.030
We have our basic reset.

13
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.590
All right.

14
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.250
And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add box sizing to border box.

15
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.220
We have our Fons family and background color.

16
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.520
You can't change any of the styling that you want.

17
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.910
Right.

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.320
But make sure that you do not, like, mess up the the structure of the game.

19
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.870
So we have our each one, which are four, which we have these styles.

20
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.570
Now, this is going to be the rapper.

21
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:34.210
The rapper has a height of hundred VH, which means it is going to grab all the height of the AFAS viewport

22
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.320
or the Web page.

23
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.110
And we have a display flex just to center everything padding of fifty.

24
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.470
And of course the flex struction is called because flex by default is going to align all the items side

25
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.130
by side.

26
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.880
And before actually showing you that, let's go ahead and open into a live server.

27
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.490
We don't have a board.

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.340
The reason that we don't have it is because we are going to generate a dynamically using G.S..

29
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.430
All right.

30
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.000
So if you were to consider comment about this one, then you can see that all the items are side by

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.280
side.

32
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.270
That's because of the default layout direction of the flex.

33
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.370
It's horizontal.

34
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.630
If you set it to column is going to be vertical.

35
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.160
We have our board, which is going to have a maximum with a 460.

36
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.640
And this is where our board is going to be.

37
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.750
This is our board.

38
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.320
That's why I commented of the blue color.

39
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.520
And we have Highton width for now for each of the this is going to be this is the boxes within the board.

40
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.190
Now, each of the boxes, they are going to have a height and and width of 150.

41
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.800
So they are actually squares, we have our display again just to center the text within the box, vertically

42
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.760
and horizontally, the font size is one 20.

43
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.700
Then we have some basic styling for the button and hover effect.

44
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.010
So if you hover on it, you can see that it changes background, color and color.

45
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.710
And I think that is going to be it for the human cost of this project.

46
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.680
Let's dive into the G.S..
