1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,010
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,520
In this lecture, we are going to create our questions.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,560
All right, so the first real thing that we do.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:20,230
What this application is to create questions, but before creating those, I need to grab whatever it

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,940
is that we want from our team.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,860
So I'm just going to click on this one and I'm going to remove the Dargis from there.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,270
So we need I need to show you what it is that I'm grabbing.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,049
So let's move one, two, three from there.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,540
So first off, let's create a contest.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,820
I want to grab our start button because these are the things these are the elements.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,950
All of these we need in JavaScript to apply some sort of functionality or to do something with it.

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,490
So let's say document, dot, query.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,010
So I try I will try to be like quick, because this is very simple.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,340
This is the start button, right, and the next is going to be the case and then the question, so let's

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:11,010
grab the start and let's change it to quiz the next one is going to be our question.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,410
OK, that is incorrect.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,760
Was.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,990
All right, so we have successfully grabbed our start button start if the question if Assad acquisitive

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,930
and the question the next thing that I want to grab is all of our answers choices and I want to store

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,410
them all in search choices.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,590
And all these are actually these for answer choices, all in search choices.

22
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,480
And I want to say document.

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,560
That query selector.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,460
All right, and I'm going to grab them by their class, which is diet choice.

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,570
All right.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,560
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab them individually as well, because I want to

27
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,700
fly an avid listener on all of them.

28
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,990
And I want to play an event listener on each of them individually.

29
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,680
When the user clicks, I want to run it against the correct answer.

30
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,930
And I want to know for sure if that answer that the user has clicked is actually the correct answer

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,180
or the correct answer.

32
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:24,820
So I'm going to create another contest and I'm going to call it answer choice, eh?

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,860
So this is going to be answer choice.

34
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:35,740
And this is going to be let's you know what, cuppy this button right here and it has an idea of a so

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,450
let's copy it three times.

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,250
Let's grab this a.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,820
Let's grab this, let's change it to be change this, to be change this, to see who's to see.

38
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:56,020
Let's grab this a change it to see, grab this one and we are changing it to death.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,930
So we have selected all of our answer choices.

40
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,470
The only two things remaining are the timer.

41
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,580
Right.

42
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,580
Actually three things we need to get our timer container and core container.

43
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,240
So to be able to get those, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this and I'm going to paste it

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,140
right here and I'm going to change the start to counter.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,320
And so what is the class name for the counter?

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,790
The class name for the counter is actually counter itself.

47
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,160
So let's say counter.

48
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,060
Right.

49
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,990
And let's create a two more times.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,710
The next thing down a grab is going to be time gauge.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,940
Right.

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:47,660
And the class for that is time gauge itself to copy the class name, put it right here.

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,950
And after that, what I want to grab is going to be the progress.

54
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,370
And then we are going to grab the score div the score container, which we are going to save it inside

55
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,050
this quarter.

56
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,300
So let's grab this one.

57
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,050
I'm just going to call it progress.

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,090
Right.

59
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,140
And the class for this is progress container.

60
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,460
Let's put it right here.

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,560
I should probably call it progress container.

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,149
All right.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,950
So this is progress container.

64
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,910
And finally, we are going to have our score diff.

65
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:32,460
Or score, we could call it container, it is better it's a better name score container and let's change

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,580
it to the container is the same.

67
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,990
Let's just convert it to score.

68
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,930
So we have selected everything that we needed here.

69
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,320
Right.

70
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,530
The next thing that I want to do is our questions.

71
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,930
Let's create our questions now.

72
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,420
We do not need these two panes here.

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:56,400
I think if I remove this so open it once more, I'm not really comfortable doing this multi window thing.

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
I've never done it.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,130
I just wanted to do in this lecture.

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,110
These are questions.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,330
Now, there is something that I should mention here that these questions this is not a proper way of

78
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,870
doing it.

79
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,800
The proper way of doing it is that these questions, they're either going to come in through a different

80
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,550
platform, through an API, or they're going to be fed through the through a certain database and the

81
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,110
questions that are going to be there.

82
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,800
And each time any user logs into their account, they're going to see a different set of questions with

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,860
a different set of background images for those questions.

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,300
But for the purposes of this front and application that we are building inside JavaScript, we are going

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,220
to create the questions and we are going to mimic a database inside the JavaScript itself.

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,520
So I'm going to say let questions questions right.

87
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,050
And I'm going to create an array.

88
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,470
And inside this array, we are going to have ten objects.

89
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:02,190
Each of the objects is going to have I a question as a key.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,970
The value is going to be the question string itself.

91
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,870
Then we have the question image, our four choices and then the correct.

92
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm going to create the first object and I'm going to copy paste the rest of them.

93
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,770
So what is the question?

94
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,510
The question is going to have a key off question itself and the answer is going to be inside these quotes.

95
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,940
And we are going to say how many I'm not going to type.

96
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,720
It's you know what?

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,370
I'm not going to type it out.

98
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,760
So this is our very first question.

99
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:38,430
This is where you can change the questions and this is where you can increase or decrease the number

100
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,590
of questions that you want.

101
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,930
There is a problem with this application.

102
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,670
This is not actually a problem.

103
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,490
This is something that whenever you work with a front end application, this is something that you're

104
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,690
bound to have.

105
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,590
All right.

106
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,000
You're you're going to have it.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,410
All right.

108
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,350
So this is the what I've done is I've just.

109
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,710
Right.

110
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,660
Click on the page and I'm saying view page source and this is the HTML.

111
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,610
So here is the JavaScript update.

112
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,820
And if I click on it, we can see our entire JavaScript code for this application.

113
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,250
But the problem is that we can see our questions and our correct answer as well.

114
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,160
That's why we never want to do this.

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
We never want to store sensitive information in the front end.

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:33,390
Like imagine if you if you created a Facebook account and or a YouTube account or like not YouTube,

117
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,540
like an Instagram or Twitter account.

118
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,370
And your password username would have been saved in The View page source.

119
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,820
And everyone could have used every other person's like identity that would have been like really messy.

120
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,120
Right.

121
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,390
That's why we store these sort of confidential information on the server and server is somewhere the

122
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,020
user can never access unless they hack it.

123
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,390
All right.

124
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,390
So this is our first and key value pair.

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:11,760
The next one is going to be question IMG, make sure to spell it correctly, question IMG and we're

126
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,830
going to provide it with the path.

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,480
So the path is the image is there inside the image folder and the the number is one that jpg.

128
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,110
It throws an error here because there is no comma here.

129
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,260
So add another comma.

130
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,610
Now we have our choice.

131
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,350
A this is the answer choice.

132
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:37,650
Say it is 100, then we go to choice.

133
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,000
Choice.

134
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,909
Let's you know what, let's just copy it.

135
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:48,060
So for the choice B we are going to have.

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,760
A hundred and fifty four choices.

137
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,180
We are going to have ten.

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:04,160
OK, this is C. And this is D. This is going to be 27 and the final key value pair that we are going

139
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,660
to have is going to be correct.

140
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,270
Answer.

141
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,130
Now, here is where we will insert our correct answer, which is 100.

142
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:18,020
And whenever we run, this is where we are going to run this or whenever we run this event.

143
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,130
Listener, it is going to grab our correct answer and it is going to evaluate it against whichever choice

144
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,420
the user has clicked.

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,370
If these two strings they are equal, then it is going to that that little box is going to turn green.

146
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,230
If they're not equal, it means it's wrong, then that box is going to turn red.

147
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:46,280
And we have created our very first object and I'm going to grab the rest of the objects and I'm going

148
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,310
to paste them down here because this is very tedious and time consuming.

149
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,670
These are basically all the same.

150
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,980
So we have our correct answer here.

151
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,890
We have our choice DCB a question, image and question itself.

152
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,230
So we have created our questions.

153
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm going to collapse all of the questions and I'm going to keep either the first one or the last one

154
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,800
doesn't really matter because we are going to access the values from this object, the properties of

155
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,460
this object.

156
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,940
And I need to have one of these shown on the screen.

157
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,940
This is going to be it for this lecture in the next election.

158
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,570
We are going to continue building this massive application.
