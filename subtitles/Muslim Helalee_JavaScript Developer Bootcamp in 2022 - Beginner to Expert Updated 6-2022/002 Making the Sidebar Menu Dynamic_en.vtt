00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.530
Hi, everyone in this natural world and implement the functionality of a responsive sidebar navigation

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.920
menu.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.360
All right.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.440
So so so far, all these styles and all the all the exterior elements are done.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.630
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually go ahead and grab three things in JavaScript.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.190
The reason for that is those three things.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.750
One of them is going to be our hamburger menu.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.970
The next one is going to be our header.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.020
And then we are going to have our overlay, because as you guys can see, that unless this button is

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.580
correct, we are not going to see our overlay, the cross and the main header.

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.160
So.

12
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.920
First things first, I'm going to grab the toggle button, this is the hamburger menu, I could call

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
it the hamburger button or hamburger button.

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.330
I could just go ahead and call it hamburger.

15
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.170
It makes more sense that way.

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.040
And we are going to say, query, select.

17
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.430
All right.

18
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.480
So what is the class for this?

19
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.090
It is the toggle.

20
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.550
I guess I grab the class from this, from Sears, from FEMA.

21
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.590
So let's go ahead and let's make this smaller a bit and let's make this bigger.

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.830
We grab the hamburger because we want to click it.

23
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.910
Then we are going to grab the main header.

24
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.960
The reason for that is we are we want to make sure that it expands.

25
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.530
The width is increased.

26
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.380
That's why we are going to grab it.

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.410
We going to say document, document, query, selector.

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.720
I'm sure by now the concept of JavaScript variables and selecting something in JavaScript and applying

29
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.460
different lessiter or dumb manipulation has become second nature to guys.

30
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.130
We have done it a lot and we are going to continue doing it a ton more.

31
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.040
And finally, we are going to grab our overlay.

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.230
And we are going to say document.

33
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.530
Dot query selector, and we are going to grab it by its claws, which is overlayed.

34
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.350
All right, so we only have one event listener here, and that is going to be applied on the hamburger

35
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.800
button.

36
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.080
So whenever we click on this hamburger button, three things happen.

37
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.620
One, this becomes a cross.

38
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.080
The second, the header is going to appear from the left or it's going to expand to be more accurate.

39
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.490
And third, our overlay is going to appear.

40
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.440
So three things should should happen.

41
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.820
So we are going to send out a listener.

42
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.310
We are listening for a click, and when the click happens, we run a function.

43
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.640
All right, so the first thing is that our hamburger button should have a class of we are going to add

44
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.230
a class of open.

45
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.220
But there is actually another method with even listeners that we have, and that is the toggle button.

46
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.170
So we could go this way, we could grab the hamburger button and add the class of open and then check

47
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.740
if it has the class of open, then we would remove the class of open.

48
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.670
But we do have another method and that is toggle.

49
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.220
So if we provided with the toggle method, what it does is it is going to do this checking all on its

50
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.300
own, because this is a smart method.

51
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.450
It is going to take a look at the hamburger button.

52
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.950
If the hamburger button has a class of open, it is going to remove it.

53
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.310
And if the hamburger button doesn't have a class of open, it is going to add that class of open.

54
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.690
So it is going to judge that decision.

55
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.330
It is going to take that decision on its own.

56
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.030
And we do not have to provide it with an IF statement.

57
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.770
So this is how we are going to implement it for the hamburger and also for the main header and the overlay

58
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.500
overlay.

59
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.930
This is our overlay and this is going to be our main header.

60
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.140
So main header, let's save everything.

61
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.220
Let's come here.

62
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.910
And this is our finished product.

63
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.730
So if I click on it, we are going to see all the lines up front and they form a cross.

64
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.790
We see all our navigation, which are very well clickable and it doesn't matter where you click, you

65
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.930
have to click this cross to be able to get rid of everything.

66
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.520
So this is toggle.

67
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.930
This is toggle is off.

68
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.390
On, off.

69
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.260
Think of it like 011.

70
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.130
OK, so this is it, this is it for our project.

71
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.300
I know this one all most of these projects so far, they have been very, very small projects.

72
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.430
But because these projects, they are beginner to intermediate level.

73
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.110
Whenever we get to our advanced projects, we are going to cover even more interesting.

74
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.520
But first things first.

75
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.410
We should cover these projects first to see you guys in the next one.
