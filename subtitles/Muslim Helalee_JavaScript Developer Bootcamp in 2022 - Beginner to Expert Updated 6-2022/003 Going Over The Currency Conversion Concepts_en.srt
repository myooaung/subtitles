00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,820
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,560
In this lecture, we're going to get our exchange rate.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,630
All right, so the euro that we will be making requests is this and you can see that it has an axis.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,760
Well, technically, when you're creating programs, you should hide this axis key and no one else should

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:29,670
use it, because if you're fetching data from a paid you ORL or paid API, you and you don't want to

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,140
pay for that you are or for the for the requests that you make, then you will you will have a limited

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,480
amount of requests either per day or per per hour or per month or per week.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,910
It ranges from 50 per day to 2000 per hour or even 20000 like per hour or per day, something like that.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,070
So you're going to have a limitation if you don't want to pay.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,230
So you need to, like, hide this access.

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,320
But because this is for teaching purposes, I don't want to hide it and I want to show it to you.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,400
Otherwise, how would you create this?

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,070
And if you exceed the amount that is allowed, the I mean, the requests, then you are going to get

14
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,510
a four to nine error that is going to say, which is a client error.

15
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,210
And HTTP status is for tonight.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,550
It is a client error and it says that you have made too many requests and just go ahead and and wait

17
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,360
for an hour or two and then make requests and then it should go away.

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,680
Now, the reason that this is being displayed like this inside the browser is because I've installed

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,930
a Jason Vue extension for Chrome.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm not sure what this extension is available for Firefox or not.

21
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,460
You can just go ahead and and check it out if I deactivated and reload.

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,250
This is what we are going to get.

23
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,910
Very ugly.

24
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,230
Right.

25
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,650
But if you come to Extension's and activate it and reload the page, you can see that we sort of get

26
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,250
like a mini text editor or something like that.

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,720
So that's what I wanted to show here.

28
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,120
These two tabs, I'm not going to talk.

29
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,060
Hopefully we I want to talk about.

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,180
But if if we take too much time, I'm not going to talk.

31
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,520
And then we are we have to talk about it in the next lecture.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,110
So what do we have here?

33
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:31,440
Let's first decode the code that we have here and then we can actually come up with a way to find out

34
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,030
how can we experiment with this and how can we create this application.

35
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,170
And on the second and the second on second thought, we will be talking about these two tabs in this

36
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,820
structure as well.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,550
So you can see this is the date that we are getting these conversion rates.

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,710
But now the thing is this base.

39
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,150
So the base currency is going to be EQR or Yero, right.

40
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,870
So this is the base currency.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,520
It means that all the rest of the currencies that you can see here, all of them are calculated based

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,130
on the euro.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,750
So one euro is one, one euro is four point three.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm not sure what this is.

45
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,240
I think it's an Australian.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,750
No, no, that's a Yudi.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm not sure what this is.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,870
So we could always check it and say it in the browser.

49
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,090
A Z is a tided a Z currency.

50
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,550
I'm just going to check this one.

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,910
I'm not going to check the rest of the.

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,480
It's Unirea, United Arab Emirates, their home, their home, yeah.

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,860
So one euro is this many dirhams, this many Afghanis, this many Al and I'm just going to use the popular.

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,280
So one euro is how many USD?

55
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,760
Easy to decode for everyone.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,420
So one euro is one point one seven two, so you can see that the data that we get is actually have a

57
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
base of euro.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,330
And why is this something that you need to know?

59
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,040
You might ask.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,210
The reason for that is the thing that I'm mostly going to be working with is my own current country's

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,730
currency, which is Afghani or Afghani, as you are used to hearing it.

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,380
So one Afghani equals zero point zero one three.

63
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,580
All right.

64
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,070
But one Afghani is zero point zero one one euro.

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,400
You can see how different these are.

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:32,890
Right.

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:42,090
So if I were to, like, copy this and put it right here and let's say change it to one, I don't know,

68
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:49,990
like, let's see, one barony, Bahamian dollar or Canadian dollars, Canadian dollar.

69
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,340
So if I change it to.

70
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,120
Where is the where were you, Canada?

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,740
Yeah, here it is.

72
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,340
So you can see that one Canadian dollar is actually ninety point one oh Afghani's.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,910
So we get different exchange rates for different.

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,340
I should have done the other way around, but still, that's OK.

75
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:24,670
But the thing is that when these are different and our base of the data is euro, how can I change this

76
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:33,040
this zero point zero one three to zero point zero sorry, this zero point zero one one to the zero point

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,700
zero one three.

78
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,750
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the calculator.

79
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,510
So let's go ahead and let's grab this calculator.

80
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,670
The calculator is right here.

81
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,050
So what I'm going to do is so we have our basic URL, right?

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,830
And that is euro, not base euro based currency.

83
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,000
This is your right.

84
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,070
And we know that euro to Afghani, Afghani to euro is zero point zero one one.

85
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:07,840
And I just see if I can get it the other way around because, you know, right away right now the Internet

86
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,630
is disconnected and because the electricity is gone.

87
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,870
And basically I'm speaking from the top of my head.

88
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:22,180
So forgive me if I say something that I'm not supposed to say because my thing you can see that it's

89
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,990
not working.

90
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,770
So it doesn't matter what I do, it's going to show me the same thing because there is no Internet connection.

91
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,290
So I'm just going to go ahead and explain this part.

92
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,480
And if electricity comeback's comes back, we are going to continue the structure.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,100
If it doesn't, then I'm just going to cut it and I'm going to wait for whenever it comes.

94
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:49,450
So that's the thing about this country, all right, so one euro is going to be zero point zero one

95
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,070
one sorry, one Afghani is zero point zero one one euro and one if one is zero point zero one one one

96
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,860
three dollars.

97
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,100
So it's different.

98
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,220
How can I make sure that the value that we get is actually correct?

99
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,740
Why is this a problem?

100
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,280
This is a problem because whenever you want to create that application, because the base is euro,

101
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,800
you are limited to euro.

102
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:24,910
So you can change from a currency, from a certain currency to euro or from euro to a certain currency.

103
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,460
So either one of these two currencies should be euro.

104
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,790
So in that sense, you're limited.

105
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:40,240
You cannot, for example, exchange, let's say, USD to like a Z or a Canadian dollar or Australian

106
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,660
dollar.

107
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,870
You cannot change something that is not euro to something that is not euro.

108
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,270
You're not you're not able to do that with this set of data.

109
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,200
All right.

110
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,520
But how can we do that?

111
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,670
So the way that we can do that, as we have to find out the exchange rate.

112
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,130
So the what is this exchange rate?

113
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,930
This is not the exchange rate.

114
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,190
Right.

115
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,310
What is the exchange rate from Afghani to Europe?

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:12,250
So the way that we can get that is so we know that one euro is ninety point or two six.

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,760
Right.

118
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,670
If I want to get the exchange rate for that, the only thing that I have to do is I want to divide one

119
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,710
by this.

120
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,200
And when I divided by that.

121
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,540
Let me put it on the side here.

122
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,150
Can I bring come on.

123
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,630
Yep, we can do it.

124
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:38,450
So you can see that the screen is lagging because there is no electricity, so I'm just going to put

125
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,480
it one divided by I see to this ninety point.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,590
Come on, buddy.

127
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,880
So it's ninety point oh two six seven one five.

128
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,990
And if I save it, this is what we get.

129
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,910
So the exchange rate is zero point zero.

130
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,750
So one one actually, we got that here.

131
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,390
All right.

132
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,270
So this is what we get how we can we convert this to zero point zero three.

133
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,960
All right.

134
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,970
The the way that we can convert this is so this is the base that we got.

135
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,520
Right.

136
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:23,150
If I can if I multiply this by the base for the USD that we have based on the euro, what is the US?

137
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,860
So we have one point one seven.

138
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,580
So if I multiply that by where is that?

139
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,570
It's right here.

140
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:36,340
I'm going to keep it there by one point one seven two six two six eight four.

141
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,170
And if I save it, you can see what it is that we get.

142
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,140
We get zero point one three.

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,990
And isn't this the same as what we have here?

144
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:55,340
So in our function that we will be creating what we are going to do is we are going to grab the base

145
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:02,270
currency and we we are going to find this out because this isn't a currency companioned.

146
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,720
The currency companion will allow you to exchange currencies without going to Google.

147
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,800
So we need to find this one out.

148
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,790
And when we find this one out, we just what do we do?

149
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:25,030
We grab that currency that we want to convert, a.k.a. from currency cote, and then we divide upon

150
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,490
it one.

151
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,670
OK, so we say one divided by by that from currency, so one divided by this.

152
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,610
And we are going to get something called right.

153
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,660
We are going to get a number and then that number will be multiplied by the currency to which we want

154
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,260
to change.

155
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,770
So in this case, we want it to change from Afghani to dollars and that's how we did it.

156
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:56,480
So if you want to change it from Canadian dollars, which should be up here, Sead, so this is the

157
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,370
Canadian dollar.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,590
So if you want to change Canadian dollar to, let's say to CDF, what do you do first?

159
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,510
You say one divided by the Canadian dollar.

160
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,430
So let's do that.

161
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,940
So one divided by one point five four nine oh three three.

162
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,230
This is because we want to get the base.

163
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:27,100
I multiplied it to one divided by one point five four nine oh three three.

164
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,460
So let's save it.

165
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,800
So this is the base.

166
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,380
So one euro is going to be sorry.

167
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,380
One Canadian dollar is going to be zero point six for Europe.

168
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:43,850
So now we get this when we get this and we want to change not to euro, but Canadian dollar to CDF or

169
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,450
whatever the says or to you and the United States dollar.

170
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,060
We just have to multiply this by one point one seven.

171
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,850
So multiply one point one seven two six.

172
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,700
So we get so this is the conversion rate.

173
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,330
All right.

174
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,400
And if you multiply 1000 Canadian dollars by this, you're going to get seven hundred and fifty six

175
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,490
dollars.

176
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:21,110
So 1000 Canadians, if I am not mistaken in my calculations, is going to be 756.

177
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,150
And you can see that it's one point five four and it is one point one.

178
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,480
So point four is different and that is going to account for two hundred and fifty sort of dollars or

179
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
two hundred and forty.

180
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,100
Three, I think, if I'm not mistaken.

181
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,580
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut to right here.

182
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,450
So we are done with our lecture.

183
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,510
And in the next lecture, what we are going to do is we are going to dive into this code.

184
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:56,920
There is no reason and diving into this code because there is no electricity and this Yooralla is not

185
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,670
going to work.

186
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,350
So we need to work for.

187
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,750
We need to wait for electricity to come back.

188
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,480
And then I'm going to come back for you.

189
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,210
It's just going to be like the time that you just go ahead and press on the clock and you go to the

190
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,110
next video.

191
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,150
You just press on the next and you go to the next video.

192
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,160
For me, it might be like a few hours or a few days.

193
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,190
So that's it for this lecture.

194
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,800
See you guys in the next one.
