00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,900
Hi, everyone, in this chapter working to create a password, strengthen.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,790
All right, so this is the Uiver application, we will be using regular expressions once more.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,550
All right.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,850
And this UI is very, very simple, but there is actually a lot going behind this application.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,760
So in here in this area, this area is where you type your password and this bar is going to get filled

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,479
up with a blue color.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,060
And the more this blue color is going up, it it shows, the stronger your password is.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,570
And whenever you start typing, you're going to get a few suggestions.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,170
And if you well, evaluation's that or assessments, that is going to show you that.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,900
It is going to tell you that what your password is lacking.

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,010
So if I were to just go ahead and write, for example.

12
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,820
Awesome.

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,230
So awesome, you can see that this bar is coming up and what what what what does it say?

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,440
It says the password could be longer.

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,400
It has no uppercase characters, no numbers and no special characters.

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,760
And if I were to add numbers one to three, you can see that the bar is going up and now it says could

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,480
be longer, but says no uppercase characters.

18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,170
So that's right.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:34,030
Q w e and now it still says no special character is the right person to join kerosine and it still says

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,870
could use more special.

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,660
So you have to write at least three letters, three lowercase letters, three uppercase letters, three

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,610
numbers, three special characters.

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,310
Then you are going to have a very, very strong password.

24
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,430
And also you should not repeat letters.

25
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:51,690
Right?

26
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,110
So if you have two kids, you can see that the strength is coming down.

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,860
And the more repeated letters you have or characters, the more the strength is going to is going to

28
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,580
get reduced.

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:11,290
So if I have D and then it is going past and then again, again, again C see how this is coming down,

30
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,680
because repeating characters is not a good way of creating a password.

31
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,560
So if I just go ahead and add an ampersand, you can see that the strength is full and this is a very,

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
very strong password.

33
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,380
So this is the interface of our application.

34
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,540
This is the introduction to our application.

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,540
I'm just going to make this spec right.

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,060
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over the e-mail and says, well, this is the amount.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,720
This is an our Ashmont each one.

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,750
This is our section.

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,480
We have a div which is destroying thr.

40
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,840
This is this vertical bar that you can see that is that is going to get filled up.

41
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,820
We have our input type of.

42
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:04,060
Text, and we have it now out of focus attribute on it, the autofocus attribute allows you whenever

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,380
you refresh the page, the cursor automatically goes inside that input.

44
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,820
And we have a diff which says password check and the password check.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,100
Has those text that you saw that that gave you like assessment's OK.

46
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,500
So in the C assess, we have some very basic styling for the reset.

47
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,520
Nothing new.

48
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,440
Again, we have used this reflects on the body because we want this entire thing to be centered.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,540
See, this is entirely vertically and horizontally centered and this is styling for our H1, for the

50
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,020
section.

51
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,840
We have padding and we have a specific height and a specific with 600 and 400.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
We have displayed great sort of display, flex and section.

53
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,020
Now, this is a child selector.

54
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,720
It grabs the first child that is a diff.

55
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,100
So inside this section we have to divs, which means there are two children.

56
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,500
So that selector is going to select the first one.

57
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,560
And we have said display flex on that, right, and all right, so here we have strength.

58
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,910
This is going to be our strength here.

59
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:17,959
And some basic styling for the strength or the height is this entire height is 100 percent and with

60
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,610
this 20 pixels positions relative.

61
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,400
Now, here is the important part.

62
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,390
This is the thing that is going to fill this up is actually a pseudo aliment, pseudo aliments.

63
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,430
They do not have an equivalent initiative.

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,040
They're created in success.

65
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,690
So you can create pseudo elements like it's fake elements, but still you can create them.

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,600
The thing with them as you should provide content either either that's going to be empty or something

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:47,920
else.

68
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,850
So it's just going to be empty.

69
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,400
Then we are going to position absolute the position absolute is going to take it out of this e-mail

70
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,700
document and it's going to position relatively transparent, which is the strength itself.

71
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:01,850
All right.

72
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,410
Because for now it doesn't have a height.

73
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,110
You cannot see it.

74
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,270
So if I comment that one out and if I say height of 50 pixels, OK, let's open.

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
This was life server.

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:25,130
OK, now you considered the height is 50 pixels and you could go ahead and increase it to like, I don't

77
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,420
know, like 400, it is going to go up.

78
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,920
But the thing is that we do not want a hard code this height.

79
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,020
We want this hide to be very, very flexible.

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,710
And we want it to be a percentage based Y percentage because the height of the parent is in percent

81
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,560
and calculating person is easier.

82
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,370
If you were to calculate the hide, the height of this entire thing is going to be 600 minus the padding

83
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,240
for the top and padding for the bottom.

84
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,050
So if you were to calculate it that way, that would become like really difficult.

85
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:04,920
But what we are doing here is we are grabbing a function in CISSP, which is a C assess function, and

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,720
we are multiplying the value by one percent.

87
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,940
What is this?

88
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:16,440
This VAR is actually a C is this custom property a cyesis custom property is any property that is not

89
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,710
available in excess and you make it yourself.

90
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:27,750
So a custom property looks exactly like any normal Sears's property, but the difference is that it

91
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,000
has two dashes in front of it.

92
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,140
So we have a position here.

93
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,560
This is the property name.

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,580
We have colon and we have some value for that and we have SEMICON in the same way Custom Properties

95
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,530
created the reason that we have only called the custom property here is because we are going to create

96
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,540
this custom property in JavaScript dynamically.

97
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,570
So this part that you can see here is actually the property name.

98
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
To be able to show you how this actually works is I've just come in this one out and in here I've said

99
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,410
50.

100
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,020
So this 50 is going to be passed in here.

101
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,380
And this zero, in case you're wondering, is the initial value.

102
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,290
If we don't have any other value for the strength amount, we are going to get the zero value.

103
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,470
But since we have 50, this year is going to be overridden by this.

104
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:28,130
So now we can see that we have a regular property name, property like colon, property value and semicolon.

105
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,910
But the only difference is these two dashes here.

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,990
So whenever you create this custom property, you can use it through the VA function.

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,310
So you just write VA are open and close parentheses and just pass in the name of this custom property

108
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,300
and it is going to work.

109
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:52,200
So if I were to say 50 50 is going to come right here and then it's going to be 50 times one percent,

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,420
which is 50 percent.

111
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,210
So it is going to be filled up to almost right here.

112
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,180
So 50 percent.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,220
So let's say that it's right here.

114
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,400
It's exactly 50 percent of that high.

115
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,890
If you say 100, it is going to be completely 10 percent, only this much.

116
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,770
But this value, we are going to change it dynamically in JavaScript.

117
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,890
That's why we provide it with this custom property.

118
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:24,780
This custom properties are very customizable in JavaScript and their custom properties or Cyesis variables.

119
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,500
Right.

120
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,760
There are new additions to services.

121
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Three are right.

122
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:37,890
So if you are not feeling comfortable with this e-mail and success with the VA function, with the Kalik,

123
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,059
with the Sears's Custom Properties Act, you'll have to see.

124
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:50,220
It is of course, this one is regarding flexible scripts and animations, which is hands on course.

125
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,160
There are multiple projects and the other one is actually a boot camp which covers almost all of the

126
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,650
essential properties which you will ever need when it comes to success.

127
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:10,710
And so you could go ahead and check out those courses in case you're not that completely like comfortable.

128
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,020
You're not feeling comfortable with the stimulus.

129
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:21,320
Iesus So we do have this after Suda element in the in both of the courses I go over to aliments pseudo

130
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:21,900
classes.

131
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,860
What is the difference?

132
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:29,130
How can you use them to your advantage, how you can design, you can create and design beautiful websites

133
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:36,180
and then we have our input, some basic styling for that and we have a password check which is which,

134
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,320
which is a paragraph.

135
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,500
Now this paragraph is going to be created dynamically.

136
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,080
We are not going to create it, I think.

137
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,600
Do we have we created it?

138
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,210
No, we don't.

139
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,770
We have not.

140
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,720
So we are going to create this paragraph dynamically.

141
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,460
And after it is created, after this paragraph is created, then it is going to receive these styles.

142
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,670
So these styles will be added to that paragraph, no matter if the paragraph is created or if it is

143
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,270
inside this HTML or it is going to be dynamically created.

144
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,530
That set for this lecture.

145
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,180
See you guys in the next one.
