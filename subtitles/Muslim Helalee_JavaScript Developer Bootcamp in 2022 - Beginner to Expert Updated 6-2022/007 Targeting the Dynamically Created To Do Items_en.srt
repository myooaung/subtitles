00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,910
Hi, everyone, in this picture, we are going to target the dynamically created to do items.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,870
All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our to do list and we are going to add an event

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,329
listener.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:25,800
Now, why add an event listener on the to do list and the thing which is the parent of them or not the

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,700
parent parent of them all, but it is the parent of to do items.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,030
Right, because we don't have any other actual way of targeting this icon for which has a status of

7
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,120
complete and this icon which has a status of delay.

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,650
So what we are going to do is we are going to we are going to add this event on the parent and then

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,600
we are going to do some stuff to tweak it.

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,750
I don't want to give away the surprise or the cool thing, not surprise the cool thing that we are going

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,260
to do.

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,630
I don't want to spoil it, so I'm just going to dive right in.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,069
So we are going to create a function in the function.

14
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,450
We are going to grab our event or event or write.

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,200
I think we can call it evt as well.

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,070
Let's find out.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,720
So what do we want to do when the to do list is collect?

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:26,160
Now, this is whenever we for example, when we create like let's say I'm sleeping.

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,180
Right.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,780
So whenever we created to do, we can do three things with it within that year.

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,610
Well, all right.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, this Trijicon, this is now located inside the you.

23
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,610
The story of this trash icon is completely is completely different.

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,150
I'm not talking about this.

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,530
I'm talking about this.

26
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,220
You URL that houses these Ellyse so I can click on the circle to check it.

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,630
I can unclick to I can click to uncheck it or I can click on the trash to remove it.

28
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,770
But how can I if I were to write reading how can I click on this circle.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,789
And it seems like this is an event listener and this is a click event.

30
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:09,630
All right.

31
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,770
So there is no other way of doing it except grabbing the to do list container and targeting where the

32
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,740
click happens.

33
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,940
So now we are inside the to do list.

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,420
So if I go ahead and if I say concertante log one, two, three, let's save it.

35
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,650
Let's come here.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,080
We are inside the console.

37
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,500
So if I click here.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,470
All right, so this happens when.

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:43,600
To Doolan's that another listener kaleck function, we are going to target cancer log, so let's let's

40
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,770
see why it doesn't work.

41
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,380
So I decided to do, for example, walking.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,560
It's work it and now if I go ahead and if I click, we can see that it says one, two, three and it

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,650
is going to run it everywhere.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,110
So if I click on the text, if I click on, there's anything that I click on, you can see that the

45
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,180
number increases.

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,210
So it is now 21 to 24 and all that.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,300
But we want to specifically target this and transmit.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,330
Right.

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,160
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a constant call to do item right.

50
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,290
So constant variable to do item.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,880
And I'm going to set it to either target, not either target.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,710
Evt the target.

53
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:45,630
All right, and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to cancel, log this to do item to do item, let's

54
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,670
see, let's save it.

55
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,830
And for example, let's go ahead and.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,710
Right to do.

57
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,460
And when I click on it, we can see that it says it's a paragraph, if I click on this, it is going

58
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,950
to give me an icon that has a status of complete and another icon that has a status of delete.

59
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,070
So now and if I click here, we see a well, if I click here, we can't lie.

60
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,120
So basically, we get three things.

61
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,170
We get ANELLI, we get a well and we get everything inside that elai.

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,860
Right.

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,820
OK, so enough with this council log, let's go ahead and let's actually implement code now what what

64
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:36,200
I want to do here is if if what I have clicked on has a status of complete, I want to run a certain

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,830
function.

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,210
And if what that I've clicked on has a status of delete, I want to run a different function.

67
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,060
That's what we are going to do inside this event.

68
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,550
Listener.

69
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:59,320
So I'm going to say to do I'm going to call it status if the to do status is to do item dot attributes.

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:07,370
So we are going to tap in into the attributes, attributes, dot status, dot value.

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,180
Right.

72
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,350
So now if I go ahead and if I say council log.

73
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:22,350
And let's go ahead and let's say to do status so this council log will only log to the console whenever

74
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:30,300
we click on to do item on any to do item that has a status and the status has a value.

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,220
And we have to to sort this to sort of icons like that.

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,440
So we have a status of complete and we have a status of delete.

77
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,490
So let's see that in action.

78
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,230
So now if I go ahead and if I create a to do one, if I click on this, we are going to get complete.

79
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,840
And if I click on this, we are going to get delete whenever we get a complete I want to run a certain

80
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,100
function and whenever we get a delete, I want to not I want to run another function.

81
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:56,960
Right.

82
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,130
So so far so cool.

83
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,440
Right.

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,670
So for now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say f to do status.

85
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,580
If the status is complete.

86
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,800
Do what?

87
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,030
Run the complete to do function.

88
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,370
Just run the complete to do function.

89
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,240
And as an argument we are going to person to do item.

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,560
All right, else F.

91
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,910
Also, remember, this is not an ounce, not like in any other scenario, we have only two scenarios,

92
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,200
one or the other.

93
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,290
So if the status is complete, we are going to run the complete to do function, which we are going

94
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,370
to create, of course.

95
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:49,760
And if the status is equal to to do status equals to keep in mind the strict equality.

96
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:58,400
If it is equal to delete, we are going to run another function and that is remove to do and we are

97
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,160
going to pass and that to do item that we want to remove.

98
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:10,160
So whatever is the to do item, which is the target, which is the one that we have collect, either

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,590
it is going to have a status of complete or it is going to have a status of delete.

100
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,980
If if that item that we have clicked on that to do item has a status of complete, we are going to run

101
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,730
this function.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,110
If it has a status of delete, we are going to run this function.

103
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,580
So to do item.

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,840
Right.

105
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,010
And that's it.

106
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,540
That's it for now.

107
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,160
All right.

108
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:41,560
But this event listener is not going to work because we we we have to create the complete to do and

109
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
then remove to do.

110
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,350
Functions which you are going to complete, in which we are going to create in our next lecture.

111
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
See you guys then.
