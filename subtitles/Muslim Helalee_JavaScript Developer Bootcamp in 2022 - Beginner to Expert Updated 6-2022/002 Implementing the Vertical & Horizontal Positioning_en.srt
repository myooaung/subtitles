00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,010
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to implement the vertical and horizontal position manipulation.

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:19,350
All right, so before being able to apply all these logic, what we have to do is first we have to select

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,000
the block and then we are going to select our because what we want to do here is whenever we change

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,090
these whenever we change this range, we want this block to move.

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,610
So first things first.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,680
We are going to select this block.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:42,330
And secondly, we are going to select this position y range slider and this position X range slider.

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:42,890
All right.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,360
So coming in here, right.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,060
I'm going to do this.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,080
I'm going to say let and I'm going to call the block block.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,590
Right.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:57,440
I could also say block Elliman, just to differentiate between the actual ID name and the variable name

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,030
that we create in JavaScript.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,140
Now let's go ahead and get selected.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,470
Now, if I come into the e-mail, OK, let's expand these as well.

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,030
Now, this blog has an idea of blog.

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:17,780
So what I'm what I can do is I can just say get element by ID or I can just do our our very overused

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,800
query selector.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,400
Right.

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,310
So there is actually no difference.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,700
So I'm just going to go ahead and query selector and we are going to put in the numbers sine or hash

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,930
sign for the ID.

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,310
Now we have successfully selected that.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:41,510
Now after this I'm going to select our horizontal position range slider and the vertical position range

26
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,980
slider.

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,880
So I'm just going to call him those vertical position.

28
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,860
All right.

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,180
Very generic name.

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,680
We're going to say document a query selector.

31
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,160
By now, you're very familiar with this process of selecting and then implementing some sort of functionality

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,430
on elements.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,479
And there was actually no need for me to, like, make you go through all these selections.

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,520
But this is a good habit because we are in the early chapters.

35
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,090
This is Chapter 23 and because there is a lot more coming.

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:24,470
That's why I'm saying that we are in the early chapters of this course and we should get as many as

37
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,180
much practice as we can.

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,950
All right, and I'm going to selected by its I.D. and we are going to save position dash Y for the position

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,470
X, I'm just going to copy it down below and I'm going to put it to X and we are going to say this as

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
per position.

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,500
Horizontal Hari's on.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:51,140
So, all right, the next thing that I want to do is now there are a lot more select tourists that we

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,220
have to do here.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,660
But I'm going to I'm going to write those variables whenever we get to those specific sections.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,940
But in this lecture, what I want to do is I want to grab the vertical and horizontal positioning and

46
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,020
I want to apply dynamic, dynamic ness to it or functionality to it.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,840
So I'm just going to put in a comment here and I'm going to say vertical position changer.

48
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,590
Right.

49
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,580
Direct opposition, right?

50
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,990
Yes, I guess so.

51
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,780
So we are going to grab the vertical position now.

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,340
What is this vertical position?

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,450
The vertical position is the vertical range slider that we have right here.

54
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,950
So this input, which has a type of range, has an idea of position, Nashwa.

55
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,400
And we have selected it right here.

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,910
This is where it is selected.

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,780
So we have selected that and we are going to say that event listener.

58
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,550
OK, now the event that we are we are listening for is not a click event because we are talking about

59
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,850
rain.

60
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,970
Slider's, the event is going to be a change event.

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,630
Right.

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,970
And whenever that event is fired, we are going to run a function.

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,130
What does the function is going to do?

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,400
The function is going to do one very basic thing.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,540
The function is going to change the position of that specific block.

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,740
So in here, I'm going to grab our block element and I'm going to tap into the Cyesis world and we are

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,550
going to say that a right to top it always does that.

68
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,150
And we are going to grab the vertical position, OK?

69
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,150
They're going to grab the vertical position and from there we are going to access the value and we are

70
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,070
going to add pixel to it.

71
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,510
Let's give it Skowhegan and let's see if it works.

72
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,050
All right.

73
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,570
So if I click here now, the block moves down.

74
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,700
If I click here, the block moves down.

75
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,480
Right.

76
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:56,800
Now, let's go ahead and let's cancel the log, the vertical position, that value as well so we can

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,660
see what what is it that we are actually getting so that value, let's save it and let's go into inspect

78
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,730
console.

79
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,790
So whenever I click, I should be able to see something inside the console.

80
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:17,850
Now the value is 250 and this value is pixels because we have added a pixel value at the end of it.

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,500
So the vertical positioning that it is done, we have successfully implemented that.

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,790
And this is a very, very simple project, it does a lot.

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,950
OK, there is there is a lot of things going on, but the idea and the concepts there are very, very

84
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,400
simple.

85
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,160
So let's go ahead and let's test it forward and backward.

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Yes, it works.

87
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,540
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to.

88
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,260
Implement the horizontal position changer horizontal.

89
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,700
Very difficult to spell.

90
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,560
I want to implement this in this lecture as well.

91
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:04,250
So we are going to grab the horizontal position in a range and we are going to add eventless into the

92
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,140
event that we are listening for.

93
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,390
But which is which is done by the user is going to be a change event.

94
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:17,860
And after the users changes that input slider or input range, we are going to implement a function.

95
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,780
The function is going to grab the block element and it is going to tap into the sea assessed world and

96
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,600
it is going to say left.

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:35,990
And we are going to say horizontal position, dot value, and we are going to add a pixel unit to it

98
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,010
as well as well.

99
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,030
All right.

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,350
So now if I click here, Noguez can see that the block is moving horizontally as well as vertically.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,790
So we could reset the position.

102
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,420
Right.

103
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,260
So this is going to be it for this lecture.

104
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,610
See you guys in the next one.
