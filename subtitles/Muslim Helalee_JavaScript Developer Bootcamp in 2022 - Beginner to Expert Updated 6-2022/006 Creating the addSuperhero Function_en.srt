00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,550
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,160
In this lecture, we are going to create the add superhero method.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,380
All right, so we have called the method right here.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,110
So what do we need to do is we need to go up here and we need to really define this method.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:19,860
Right.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,310
So.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,980
What we are going to do is, first off, let's think what this method requires, because this is the

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,630
superhero method, this is the most important method that we have.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,680
So this adds superhero method is going to grab our entry from here and is going to add it here.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,750
So this is the stage where we create our dynamic elements.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,440
Right.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,200
So what I'm going to do here is, first off, we are going to grab the parent.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,480
So we are going to say CONSED, I'm going to call it less data.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,960
You might be wondering what parent that is.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,050
It's this parent.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,060
You can see it's empty.

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,060
It requires children.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,320
So we are going to grab it and append children to it.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,650
So we are going to say document, query selector and what is the class.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,420
The class is going to be super hero.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:20,150
A superhero lest data, we have successfully selected that and now what we are going to do is we are

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,470
going to create the list container so list.

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,650
OK, const consed.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,040
Well let's go up consed list container.

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:34,790
Right.

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,320
And we are going to say document to create element.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:45,560
So this element that we are creating here is actually going to be a well and all of our list items,

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,960
they are going to go inside the sewer.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,270
And before doing that I want to grab this list container and I want to add an attribute to it.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,960
What is the attribute?

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,910
The attribute is going to be ID, what is the value for that attribute?

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,170
It's going to be list.

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,280
Now, what I want to do is I want to grab this list container and I want to push children to it.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,870
What are those children?

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,090
Those children are actually the superhero entries that the user makes.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,090
So name universe and power and also along with that trash icon.

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:31,100
So we are going to list container dot enter e-mail berganza plus equal because if you just say cool

38
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:38,330
and you create a superhero and you create a second one, the second one is going to override the first

39
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,540
one.

40
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:45,360
So what you need to do is you need to make sure that the second one is added to the first one.

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,540
That's why we say add on like that.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,220
Let's use our very favorite template strengths.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,650
Now we are going to create an ally here.

44
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,050
All right.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,990
So I'm going to say Elai and for wriggly.

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
So this is our element.

47
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,260
Now, what is this element going to grab?

48
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,190
This element is going to grab the superhero name.

49
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,690
Where is it going to grab it from the entry that we have.

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,600
All right.

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,970
So if I were to create this, we would say that entry dart superhero name where?

52
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,870
A superhero name.

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,730
Superhero name.

54
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,470
All right.

55
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,450
So the entry is going to be passed from here.

56
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:33,710
But this superhero name entry, that superhero name is going to come from right here, the value that

57
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,030
we have here, because these values have been passed here.

58
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,680
Then from here, they have been passed here and from here we are actually using it.

59
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,320
Where where are we?

60
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,410
We are going to use it here.

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,790
All right.

62
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,470
So we know what we are doing.

63
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,770
Right.

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:58,310
So when we say entry, this is the entry that we say and because it has a property on it, property,

65
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,480
superhero name and superhero universe, superhero power.

66
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,490
When we say entry, that superhero name, it is going to give us this value entry.

67
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,890
That superhero universe is going to give us this value entry, that superhero power is going to give

68
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,570
us this value.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,519
So we are just going to do it like that.

70
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,720
And I'm going to copy it two more times and I'm going to say universe.

71
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,770
And we are going to say power.

72
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:33,480
And now, finally, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create our icon, so it is I with a class that

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,950
is equal to fair.

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,220
Yes, this is the class for trash icon.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,370
So it's FASFA trash.

76
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,310
And let's put in the closing tag.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,920
So this is it for this lecture.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,670
See you guys in the next one.
