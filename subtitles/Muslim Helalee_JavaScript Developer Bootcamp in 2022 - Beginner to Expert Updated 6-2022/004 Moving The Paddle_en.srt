1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,890
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,870
In this next year, we will be moving the panel from one side to the next site.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:09,760
Perfect.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,390
So first of all, what I'm going to do as I'm going to we have to set up some events, all right, for

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,170
the left Iraqi and for the right Iraqi.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,850
All right, so what are we going to do, as I'm going to say Araghchi?

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,380
Arrow key events right now, what it is that we want to do.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:40,040
Whenever I press down on the left key, I want the paddles to move and when I release the key or when

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,020
the key up event is fired, I want to I want the paddle to stop right there.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,440
So the same thing happens for the right one.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,430
So let's grab the document and let's say a wellness listener, and we are going to grab the key down

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,870
event and create a key down function.

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:08,330
And we are also going to grab the key up event and we are going to create a key up function.

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,310
Right.

15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,370
So we have created this.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,720
So now let's go ahead and let's actually set them up.

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,290
So.

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,890
Now we have to create the key down function and the key up functions.

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,070
So what should we put them right after the draw was?

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,430
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to grab this.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,300
Let's copy it.

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,970
Let's put it right here and.

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,160
All right.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,720
All right, so here we have our drawls, so instead of that one, I'm going to do as I'm going to right

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,780
arrow keys, let's add another is up there as well.

26
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,840
So Arrow Keys events here.

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,440
We have arrow keys functions.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,410
Because both of the functions are going to be right here.

29
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,310
So the first one is going to be key down, so key down.

30
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,440
We are going to pass in our event object.

31
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:22,520
And first off, what I want to do is let's think so whenever I press the key, the arrow key left one,

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,860
I want the paddle to move to left.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,470
And when I press it to right, we want the paddle to move to.

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,640
Right, right.

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,490
So we know that we will be needing conditionals, right, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

36
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,530
use which case this time.

37
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,130
So I'm going to say idot key code.

38
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:53,240
So for the arrow, for the left out of the key code is going to be 37 for the writer to the key code

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,060
is going to be thirty nine.

40
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,030
Right.

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,090
We know that because we move the ball remember.

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,580
So in here.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,460
So what is the first case.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,780
So the case in the case that the event is that key code is thirty seven.

45
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
What do we want to do.

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:21,340
It means that it is the left arrow and what do we want to do is move paddle to left.

47
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,510
Perfect.

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,680
So I'm going to hit.

49
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,920
Left.

50
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,200
And so we are inside the switch.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,750
We are going to create we are going to call a move padel function and in there we are going to call

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,460
our directions object.

53
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,390
And from there we are going to grab the left and then we are going to break out of this statement.

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:57,130
In the case it is 39, we will be doing basically the same thing, so we have our right arrow, so right

55
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,660
arrow.

56
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,580
And that said this to 39, let's remove the other one.

57
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,870
Move Padel to right, left.

58
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,290
Perfect.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,410
So in here, we are going to call the same function I know we have not created that.

60
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,170
We are being created right after this step.

61
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,720
Right, so.

62
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:30,130
OK, we are going to grab our directions object, and from there, let's grab the right one and right

63
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,020
after that we are going to break.

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,740
Perfect.

65
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,730
So this is the key down and for the key up, we are basically implementing sort of the same thing.

66
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,530
So we are going to say key up.

67
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:54,490
Right, and in here, I'm going to pass in the event of object as well, and we are going to say switch.

68
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,470
So a switch in the parentheses is going to be our condition.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,580
So key code.

70
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,210
Is the condition, if the key code is 37.

71
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,400
If the key code is 37, we want to stop moving.

72
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,750
If the key code is 39, we also would like to stop moving.

73
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,230
But for both of them, I'm going to apply only one condition, because until you break from this case,

74
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,320
we know that the other statements will also run.

75
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,970
So I'm not going to break from 37.

76
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm just going to go to 39.

77
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:41,510
And for both of them, I'm going to say direction that stop and now we are going to break them perfect.

78
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,510
So I think these are completed.

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,910
So right after there, I'm going to grab this comment.

80
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm going to put it right here.

81
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:58,050
And we are going to create the move parallel function and then move parallel function what it is that

82
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:58,730
we want to do.

83
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,140
So let's see.

84
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,660
So we have the move panel function and in here, because we have an argument, we need a parameter for

85
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:09,900
that.

86
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,880
And I'm just going to call it direction, because that is going to be the direction and we are going

87
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,770
to say switch direction.

88
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:27,540
So if the direction is going to be left, move, we are going to we are going to change the direction

89
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,610
of the velocity.

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,190
So case direction dot left.

91
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:43,470
Do what we are going to grab our paddle and from there we are going to grab the X velocity and we are

92
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,850
going to set it to paddle.

93
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:54,970
That negative padel X velocity, we just change the direction of the velocity.

94
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:07,210
And now let's break out of there and in case the direction moves, the direction is right, not right.

95
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,980
Oops, not eight.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,710
Right.

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,210
In case the direction is right.

98
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:20,610
What it is that we want to do, we want to grab our panel and the X velocity and we are going to say

99
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,790
we are going to set it to a positive velocity so it moves to the right.

100
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,670
So and then we are going to have to break from it.

101
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,520
And finally if the direction in case the direction is stop.

102
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:46,780
We are going to grab the paddles x velocity and set it to zero and let's break from that as well, so

103
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,060
we should be able to see something.

104
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,500
So if I go right, I'm not you should click there.

105
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,890
I'm not going anywhere.

106
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,340
We should see something, but we are not actually moving.

107
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:12,030
So we have grabbed every we have created these situations, they switch cases, but we have not actually

108
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,510
updated the current position of the panel.

109
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:21,540
So we are going to grab our paddle and we are going to update it with the update, the position with

110
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,020
the velocity that we have just done here.

111
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:24,800
Right.

112
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create an update paddle function,

113
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,500
so.

114
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm going to come beneath our set dimensions, so whereas I'm just going to collapse that one beneath

115
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,669
our set dimensions.

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,760
What I'm going to do is, you know what, I'm just going to expand this, so in case there is something

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,950
that you want to you can see and there is an error that you fix, for example, there is something that

118
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,440
you have mistyped and you see it and you just want to, like, type it again or something like that.

119
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,480
When we have a lot of code, I'm going to collapse the ones that we are not going to need.

120
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,420
So in here, let's grab these set dimensions comment.

121
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,820
But are there and now let's update the position of the power.

122
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
So update, paddle,

123
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,910
paddle function.

124
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,410
So let's say function and.

125
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:35,950
So within this function, we will be actually accomplishing two things one, we will be updating the

126
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,220
position of the panel, and two, we will be implementing collision detection for the panel as well.

127
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,510
So first, let's move the panel.

128
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:58,040
And we are going to create a variable called Last Paddle Last the Last Paddles Exposition, and we're

129
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,870
going to set it to current position.

130
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,280
All right.

131
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,290
And now let's grab the current position, the position and add on to it.

132
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:17,060
Now we are going to add onto it the velocity X V, but the velocity is going to give us pixels per second.

133
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,960
We don't want to we don't want pixels per second, we want pixels per frame.

134
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:31,180
So you remember in our previous game we had time last time difference time now.

135
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:42,040
And the the idea behind those was to convert any pixels per second to pixels per frame pops to P F.

136
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:49,450
But now in this game, I didn't want to do that and I wanted to go through a different approach.

137
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:56,130
And here is so we have pixels per well, actually, this is to be more accurate.

138
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,840
This is going to be pixels per milliseconds.

139
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,380
So first off, I'm going to divide it by 1000.

140
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:13,150
So this is going to give me pixels per second, and when I multiply it by the speed that I want, for

141
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,400
example, 20, then this is going to give me pixels per frame, right.

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,340
So this is actually in pixels per second when I divide it by that, not only it is going to give me

143
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,930
the seconds, but also the pixels per frame if I multiply it by two.

144
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,270
So in each frame, the X is going to be moved by 20 in each frame.

145
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,490
Keep that in mind so you can reduce this.

146
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,600
You can set it to zero.

147
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,540
But I want it to be like a bigger number.

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,550
So this is going to be our movement of this, the paddle that we have here.

149
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:55,210
So updatable, let's actually call this so our paddle actually goes ahead and moves.

150
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:05,350
So I'm going to come here to our game loop and in here I'm going to just say update functions and in

151
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,910
here.

152
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,380
So we are going to have two different categories.

153
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,640
We are going to have draw functions and we are going to have update functions.

154
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,830
So the first update function is going to be update paddle.

155
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,120
Let's say that that's come here.

156
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,140
And if I move to the left, it is not moving to the left and it is not moving to the right.

157
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,040
It should move.

158
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,640
I don't know why it is not moving, so let's come down here and.

159
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,170
Let's actually see what's happening here, so we have selected the paddles exposition, and what we

160
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,600
want to do is we want to add on to it the velocity.

161
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,910
So we have added on the velocity.

162
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,360
And we have also, you know what?

163
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm just going to go ahead and comment this one.

164
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,970
And and I'm just going to save this.

165
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,650
Let's see.

166
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,760
Still, it is not moving, it should move.

167
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,780
I mean, have we provided let's see if this function even runs.

168
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,810
So Consolo if it runs, we are going to see a lot of one, two, three.

169
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,450
There we go.

170
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,040
So this function is running perfectly fine.

171
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,280
Oh, such a rookie mistake.

172
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:34,260
So instead of actually changing the we are basically we are going to add on a positive and negative

173
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,610
speed to the velocity because velocity is initially zero right here.

174
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,760
So we need to add onto it and then change the direction.

175
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,440
So we are going to get the speed, which is a fraction of the screen size.

176
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,020
And in here we are going to get the speed.

177
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,650
And if I say that now, you can see our paddle is moving.

178
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,220
But the problem is it is going through the walls.

179
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:01,100
So what we are going to do as we have to specify the collision detection as well.

180
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,770
So I'm just going to go ahead and close that function for now.

181
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,660
So this is going to be moving the paddle, I'm going to initialised Darrah's declare that, but we are

182
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,350
going to talk about that later, right.

183
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,900
So I'm just going to put it there.

184
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,950
And you know what?

185
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm just going to remove it for now, so you don't have to really worry about it.

186
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,240
Perfect.

187
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,270
So what should we do now?

188
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,670
Now we have to go ahead and we have to.

189
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,730
Implement the wall collision.

190
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,130
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a wall collision, so the collision is going to happen in

191
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:46,390
the extraction we have in the in the left, which is going to be like on the left wall and right, which

192
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,640
is going to be on the right wall.

193
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,530
So wall collision detection.

194
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,580
For Parul.

195
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,730
So we are going to say f f the paddles, we have done a lot of collision detection, so I'm not going

196
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,970
to really overcomplicate this.

197
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,260
We are going to go very simple.

198
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:18,480
So f the left of the paddles exposition is less than the wall, plus the panels with panels with divided

199
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,260
by two.

200
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:27,540
It means that if half of the panel is trying to go through the wall, what it is that we are going to

201
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,280
do, we are going to reposition the panel to what it is right here.

202
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,430
So let me just put it there and let's just change it to an equal.

203
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,430
Very simple, right?

204
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,530
So this is the left side al-Assaf.

205
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,440
Very, very simple, right, collision detection is simple, and I think I mentioned this, that the

206
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,710
collision detection is going to be the simplest thing that we need to concern ourselves with.

207
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,050
There are many other advanced topics.

208
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:06,170
So if the paddles exposition is greater than the canvasses elements with, it means it's going off the

209
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:15,620
right side, minus the water is moving through the wall by and trying to move through the wall and half

210
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:23,210
of the width, minus half of the with what we're going to do, we're going to reposition the panel to

211
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,420
what it is right there.

212
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,430
So let's.

213
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,680
Put it there and let's save it should work this time.

214
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:39,040
Now you can see there we go so it can half of the paddle is trying to move through the wall and it can't.

215
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:46,100
And this this time this side, you can see half of the panel is trying to move, but it can't.

216
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,340
Perfect.

217
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,920
So we have completed collision detection as well for our panel and we have also updated the position.

218
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:05,800
Perfect, and the next thing that the next logical thing that we need to do is actually to go ahead

219
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,609
and create the ball and have the ball start from, say, if I reload the page, you can see it starts

220
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,230
from the metal.

221
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,910
That's because of the new game that is being called.

222
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,920
And we want the ball to start from top of the paddle.

223
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:26,980
First, we need to create it and give it an initial position paddle and then bounce off the walls and

224
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,510
then also bounce off the paddle.

225
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,340
And then we will move on to creating the bricks, these amazing bricks that you can see here.

226
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,080
So that's it for this lecture.

227
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,780
See you guys in the next one.
