00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.570
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to insert a word dynamically created element into our

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.490
Web page, our writing, right, so we know where do we want to insert and write?

3
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.270
So it is going to be before.

4
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:28.330
And so why don't we go ahead and and store this value inside a variable called position.

5
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.350
Right.

6
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.740
So const position is going to be equal to before.

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.850
And so for this method to work, we're going to call the parent, which is the to do list.

8
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.060
OK, so where does it where is it coming from.

9
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.350
This is the to do list, which has an idea of list which we have selected.

10
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.380
Right from here.

11
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.340
Right, so.

12
00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.880
To do list that, insert adjacent HTML, so in here we're going to add two things now it says that insert

13
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.230
adjacent e-mail.

14
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.700
The first argument that we are going to insert is where, like it says insert position, where is the

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.360
position?

16
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.220
And the second thing is the estimate strength.

17
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.240
So let's go ahead and let's add the position.

18
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.420
So the position is equal to position itself because we have created a constant with the name of position

19
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.300
or you know what?

20
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.130
I'm just going to go diversify.

21
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.480
I'm going to say to do.

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.500
I am position, right?

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.260
I'm just going to call it so it is not confusing, it is to do item position.

24
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.690
It says first off at the position for that item.

25
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.450
So I'm going to say to do item position and second thing, what is it that you want to add?

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.420
It is an item that we have created right here, so I'm just going to grab it now.

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.530
This dynamically created element is stored inside the variable called item, and we have access items

28
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.210
so we can use its value.

29
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.220
All right, let's save it.

30
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.460
So for now, we are not going to be able to see anything.

31
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.240
All right.

32
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.370
So we are not going to see anything.

33
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.980
The reason for that is we have not created any event listener so far.

34
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.140
So before even going ahead and creating event listeners, I want to show you something.

35
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.680
I want to I want to show you how how this is going to react.

36
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.060
All right.

37
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.650
So we are going to grab our function and we are going to call it with four arguments.

38
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.480
But before calling it with those arguments, this parameter of trash has not yet been specified.

39
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.570
So what we are going to do is we are going to add a condition to that.

40
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.840
So F item is inside the trash.

41
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.490
If item is inside the trash, what do we want to do?

42
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.190
We don't want to do anything.

43
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.080
We do not want to create a dynamic element whenever we call the to do item.

44
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.040
And when that trash is true, we want to remove this entire thing.

45
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.790
Right.

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.090
That's why we are going to say that the function should return.

47
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.530
The functions should not do anything because trash is true, because the user has clicked on the trash

48
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.630
and when the user clicks on the trash, none of this code should run, OK?

49
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.860
And we should we should remove everything.

50
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.700
Right.

51
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.260
So now let's go ahead and let's add, I don't know, like.

52
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.670
Hmm, walk the dogs.

53
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.110
Dogs walk, his dogs walk the dogs.

54
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.300
All right, so this is going to be our first argument for the to do so, that to do is walk the dogs.

55
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.530
This is to do what is the idea?

56
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.180
The idea I'm just going to pass in zero or I could just go ahead and pass on ID itself, whatever.

57
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:55.660
And we are going to say that the complete status is false and the trash status is not flays false as

58
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.940
well.

59
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.630
So let's say let's come here and now we are working inside this.

60
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.020
It says walk the dogs.

61
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.890
All right.

62
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.960
And you can see that that this thin circle and these trash, none of them.

63
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.590
They're true.

64
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.820
All right.

65
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.620
But if I come in this one out and if I copied down below and if I grabbed the complete this done status,

66
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.150
we have said we have talked about this, that whenever done is true, we want our check button.

67
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.290
And when it is false, we want our uncheck button because the done is false.

68
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.080
We see our unchecked button.

69
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.480
See, this is uncheck, but not about also when the done is true.

70
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.100
When done is true, we want our text line through and when it is false, we want to we're simply like

71
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.970
an empty string.

72
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.610
And now because done is false, we don't see our check and we don't see our line through.

73
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.360
But what we've done is true.

74
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.900
So let's set it to true.

75
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.470
Should be able to see our stars.

76
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:08.290
Now you can see that when the done is true, we see our checkbox and we see this line through because

77
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.240
done is true.

78
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.790
Now for the final piece piece of this puzzle we don't need to do is I'm going to set this trash to true.

79
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.420
And keep in mind, whenever I save it, it means that the user has clicked on this trash and everything

80
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.200
should go away.

81
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.760
Right.

82
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.750
So let's save it.

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.380
Let's come here.

84
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.520
And we don't see anything because the user has clicked on the trash.

85
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.120
So so far, I'm just going to leave them here.

86
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.520
We know that our logic works, right.

87
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.890
So I'm just going to add another comment here.

88
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.070
I'm just going to add some some space so we know where everything is located, just going to copy it

89
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.420
and add it here as well.

90
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.860
So these are different pieces of code that we have here.

91
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.700
Right.

92
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.180
Each of them is responsible for something different.

93
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.460
And I want to separate all of them.

94
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.850
Right.

95
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.700
So in here, we have successfully created our to do function and we have tested it out and we know that

96
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.350
it works.

97
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:16.000
Now, we need to make sure that when it is not us who is inserting the to do, but it is the user inside

98
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.430
this user interface who is inserting this Tiddas, which we are going to start doing in our next lecture.

99
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.870
See you guys then.
