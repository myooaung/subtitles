00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.320
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create the ORENDER question function.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.190
Arri, But before going there, we need some necessary we need to create some necessary variables,

3
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.850
think of them as state management and JavaScript because we are going to create those here and then

4
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.250
we will be changing their values throughout this entire application.

5
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.120
There are going to be a lot there are going to be like a few, not a lot.

6
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.100
Of course, the first variable that I want to create here is going to be our last question.

7
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040
I need to get the last question.

8
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.590
The reason for that is whenever the last question is loaded, we are going to whenever the last whenever

9
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.070
we are on the last question we want after that, right after that, we want to show our score container.

10
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.570
All right.

11
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.880
So the last question is going to be our questions.

12
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.380
Array Dotts length minus one.

13
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.700
Right.

14
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.390
So this is going to be our very, very last question, because the length that array questions, the

15
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.520
length is going to return 10, 10, minus one is going to be nine.

16
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.610
And keep in mind, nine is the index of the last item inside an array.

17
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.920
So we are we are accessing the index.

18
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.930
The next a variable that I want to create is going to be our active question.

19
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.880
Now, what is the active question?

20
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.540
Initially, I'm going to set it to zero.

21
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.320
The active question is the question that the user is currently answering or is the question that the

22
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.130
user is actively answering.

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.300
So if the user is answering question number five, question number five is going to be the active question.

24
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.200
Right.

25
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.240
And finally, I want our account to be zero.

26
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.590
OK, so I want the count to be initially zero.

27
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.890
OK, so I'm going to come down here and right in here, I'm going to create a comment and I'm going

28
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.449
to call it, I'm going to write, render question, question function now render question is going to

29
00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.810
show or display a question on the page.

30
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.570
Right.

31
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.530
So we have created our questions and answers, all of that, but we need to display them on the page

32
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.870
as well.

33
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.220
So let's save it and let's check out our changes.

34
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.690
So far, we don't see anything.

35
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.400
The start button is not functional, which we are going to make it functional, of course.

36
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.050
So I'm going to say function, render question.

37
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.930
There is not going to be any parameter in here.

38
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.470
I'm going to create another variable called Q Right.

39
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.790
And this Q is going to grab our questions array and from there it is going to grab the active question.

40
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.510
Right.

41
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.440
So the active question is actually zero at first.

42
00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.300
So if I passan zero here, it is going to grab the questions array and the item that has an index of

43
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.680
zero.

44
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.660
So which item does have an index of zero.

45
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110
It is the first item inside an array.

46
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.120
Thus it is going to load the first question.

47
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.930
Right.

48
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.690
Then we are going to grab our question, right?

49
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.460
We are going to grab the question and we are going to say inner HTML.

50
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.420
So what is going to be the question?

51
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.450
So the question has already been specified right here.

52
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.370
Why and why am I keep going?

53
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.720
Why do I keep going up?

54
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.080
So this is the question.

55
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.080
So the questions LRH demand, the reason that we use our e-mail over in Urtext is whenever we want to

56
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.460
create an HTML element, we are going to use NAHB, HTML.

57
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.170
All right, so this entire e-mail is going to create for us an element with a starting tag, one with

58
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.180
an ending tag.

59
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.620
So the starting tag is going to be a paragraph, then we are going to add it.

60
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.490
We are going to add our Q dot question.

61
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.740
All right.

62
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.360
Whichever question is the correct question.

63
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.730
And then we are going to.

64
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.180
Close this element.

65
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.970
All right, so we know this.

66
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:23.370
Q The Q has a value of whatever item that has an index, which is equal to our active question.

67
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.120
Right.

68
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.190
So what?

69
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.280
Why don't I go ahead and cancel the log, the Q for you.

70
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.480
So you really understand what it what exactly it is that we are driving.

71
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:44.950
So if I see not there like console and let's call this function down here, so I'm going to say render

72
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.900
function and render a render question.

73
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.260
That was a tongue twister.

74
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.230
And we can see we get our very, very first question and it says, how many different sounds can a cat

75
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.540
make?

76
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.390
Why do we get the first question?

77
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.330
Because the active question value is zero and therefore zero here.

78
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.240
The item, the array item that has an index of zero is the first question.

79
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.140
And the first question is going to be stored inside this queue.

80
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.480
And we are going to consult a long queue and it is going to give us that.

81
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.240
Now, let's go ahead and let's consider Law Coudert question.

82
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.100
And I'm going to go back to active question, let's say Khuda Welney and and and in this way, we should

83
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.760
be able to get the text for that question.

84
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.960
Yes, we do get it.

85
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.610
This is the first question.

86
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.890
And when we do get the text, we want it to be inside a paragraph so we can show it on the page.

87
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.650
That's why we sent an e-mail.

88
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.360
So inside here is going to be the text and then we are going to add a starting tag and an ending tag.

89
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.260
And this is going to become a valid HTML element, which is dynamically created through JavaScript.

90
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.550
All right, now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our answer, chose a from which we have

91
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:15.370
created right here and I'm going to say dot enter e-mail because we are creating these elements dynamically

92
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.780
and we are going to say the value should be que no que has the que variable has access to the questions

93
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.180
array.

94
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.100
We know that.

95
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.030
But what is the answer choice.

96
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.300
A what should that be.

97
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.240
It is the choice itself.

98
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.130
So we are going to say that choice and we are going to create three more.

99
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:47.660
So answer Choice B as choice B, answer choice C is going to be Cuidad, answer choice C.

100
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.530
And OK, this is not answer choice.

101
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.620
This is just a choice, so let's grab the answer to remove it.

102
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.800
This is you know what?

103
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.230
I'm just going to do it again.

104
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.040
So kudos, Dot.

105
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.820
OK, decis.

106
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.490
Here it is.

107
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.670
This is a choice, A, B, C, D.

108
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.550
So this is going to be let's grab both of them.

109
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.510
Turn them to be.

110
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.640
Let's grab both of them.

111
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:26.500
OK, so this is Chaussy, and this should be see, I hope you're not getting confused and this is basically

112
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.240
what we have done is we have selected our elements from our HTML here.

113
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:38.860
And the value for those, the original of those is going to come from this questions array, depending

114
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.260
on which answer choice they are.

115
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.890
So if if that is the answer to say the value for that is going to come the enriched HTML, the element

116
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.660
for that is going to come from choice A and B and so on and so forth.

117
00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:00.770
And finally, what I want to do here is I want to grab our body and this is where we change the image.

118
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.790
So I'm going to say body image.

119
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.300
It should be equal to the path of where that image is.

120
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.640
So because I'm going to use a template or a template literal, we are going to use tactics.

121
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.510
Now, let's add our usual see ACSU URL.

122
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:24.680
And inside here we are going to pass in our path.

123
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.230
But the path I'm not going to add it.

124
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:33.380
I'm not going to hardcoded because if I just go ahead and if I say like it is inside the images folder

125
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.659
and it is the image one that jpg.

126
00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:42.740
If I do this, all of the all of the questions, then they are going to have the same background image.

127
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.690
And this is not something that we want.

128
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.170
We want the background image to change based on the question that we have.

129
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:56.020
That's why we have added the question image for each of those specific questions.

130
00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.890
So each question has a specific background image and we want that specific background image to be shown.

131
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.700
So we are going to access it through this question image.

132
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.750
And it is very simple.

133
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:15.380
We are going to use our template literal right here and we are going to say cu dot because we are accessing

134
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.310
the value of a very variable.

135
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.880
The best way to do that is using a template, literal or template strength.

136
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.920
This is a classic syntax and this way we have access to that image.

137
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:34.070
We can and after we access that image, we are going to say document dot body.

138
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:40.940
This is how we can select the body element of an e-mail and we are going to say style dot background,

139
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.700
very waras background image right there.

140
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.700
And we are going to set it to body image.

141
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.910
All right, so at this point, I don't think that it does show.

142
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.350
So it shows the first image because we are inserting the the active question is the first question.

143
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.600
If I change the value of the active question to one, we are going to see the second image.

144
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.510
If I change the value of the active question to five, we are going to see the fifth image, which is

145
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.110
this bird.

146
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:18.460
So what we are going to do as this active question is going to be the value that we will be increasing

147
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.520
throughout this this entire series.

148
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.420
All right.

149
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.540
So but before going forward, what I want I want to do here is whenever we rendered this function,

150
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:34.830
I want to grab our start button because at this point we can see the star and I don't want to see it.

151
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.940
So I want to grab the start button and I'm going to say style dot display.

152
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:47.840
Should be equal to no, honey, I want to remove it, right, so now the start button is removed and

153
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.320
I want to I want to do what I want to do.

154
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.050
One more thing.

155
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.420
I want to grab a request that style dot visibility.

156
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:04.850
And I'm sure you guys remember that, that the quizes visible, the visibility has been set to Hedin.

157
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.350
Where is the question?

158
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.880
Yeah, it is hidden.

159
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.830
Now, what I want to do is I want to unhide it, unhidden it.

160
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.930
I want to make it visible.

161
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.310
So we are going to set it whenever we set visibility to head in.

162
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.410
What is the other value?

163
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.640
I'm sure you know this.

164
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.780
What is the other value?

165
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.220
The other value is visible.

166
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:33.480
And now we will be able to see everything here, so let's decrease the width of this, we can see our

167
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.700
question, we can see our answer choices, this progress.

168
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.450
This time we don't see anything else because they are dynamic elements.

169
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.990
So whenever we run our we run the render function, we do all that.

170
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.520
But we we don't have any way of doing it dynamically.

171
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.490
So whenever we click on the start button, we want all of these two to be shown that we are going to

172
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.960
be doing you know, we're following in.

173
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.670
Let's see you guys then.
