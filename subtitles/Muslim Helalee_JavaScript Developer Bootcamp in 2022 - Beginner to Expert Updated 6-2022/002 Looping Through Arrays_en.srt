00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,450
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to go over looping through arrays and looping through

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,300
objects nested within arrays.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:16,520
All right, so the first thing that we are going to cover in this lesson is going to be looping through

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,040
a race.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,040
OK, and you might ask, why do we need to loop through a race now?

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,050
Because arrays are a collection of data.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,810
If you want to grab that data each time, we have to, for example, call it by its index.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,590
Now, the easier way is just to loop through it, OK?

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:45,320
Because as we have covered in our previous lecture, we we we talked about how loops they allow us to

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,800
right to repeat code, right to repeat code and to decrease the number of lines of code.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,500
OK, so let's see that in action.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,510
So we have a concept.

13
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,470
Let's create a const, we are going to create a loop and sorry, an array of numbers and the numbers

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,160
inside of it.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,050
They are twenty five.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,820
Sixty five.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,800
Ninety five.

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,450
Forty five and one thirty five.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:22,520
All right, so we have five items inside this array and if I want to grab all of them at the same time,

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,890
there is no other way besides loop.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,290
If I want to grab all of them then I have to grab each of them like individually by its index.

22
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,020
But a better way is just to go ahead and loop through it.

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,680
OK, so for that we are going to create a for a loop.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,010
First off, the structure of the for loop.

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,030
So in here, what do we want to do.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,460
OK, so first we have to provide it with the loop variable.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,480
So we are going to say let's equal to zero.

28
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:57,650
We want the loop variable to start from zero and we want the loop variable to go all the way to one

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,880
less then to less than the length of the array.

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,490
And you might ask why less than the length of the array.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,840
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and comment that out and I'm going to cancel the

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,240
log this array, and I'm going to tell you why we go less than the array that length.

33
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,200
So now you guys can see here, what do we have here, it says that the length is five, but what is

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,520
the final index?

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,720
The final index is for so four is one less than five.

36
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,340
Right.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,480
So if we want to grab all the array items by their index, the final index is always one less than the

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,790
length of that array.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,530
Right.

40
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,450
So array length is five, the final index is four.

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:46,600
And the reason for that is the length starts from one to one, two, three, four and five.

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,190
But the index, it starts from zero indices in JavaScript, they start from zero.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,850
OK, so I'm going to comment that out and we are going to comment this code back in and we want to go

44
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,010
all the way to numbers that length.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,220
Less than that.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,590
All right.

47
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,230
And we want to each time we want to increment E by one.

48
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,650
And now, first of all, let's go ahead and let's look to the council, our evaluable, and we are going

49
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,470
to see that it grabs the index of zero one, two, three and four.

50
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,070
So it has successfully tapped into the world of indices of this.

51
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,500
Right.

52
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,470
So what do we want to do with this index that we that we can grab now?

53
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:35,000
Now, let's go ahead and let's print the index that we have and also the numbers associated with that

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,600
index.

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,530
Let's say that so the number 25 has an index of zero, the number 65 has an index of one and all the

56
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,150
way to number 135 has an index of four.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,730
So this is how we can grab numbers based on their index.

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,030
Now, I'm just going to go ahead and give you another example as well.

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,460
And that is just numbers and the the low variable.

60
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:08,530
And then now we can we have successfully accessed all the loop items with just with just one loop.

61
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,250
With just one loop, OK.

62
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,120
Now this is called looping through arrays.

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,690
The next topic that I want to discuss is looping through objects nested within arrays.

64
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:27,880
So I'm going to grab that and I'm going to put it here through objects nested within arrays.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,900
Right.

66
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,750
So first off, let's go ahead and let's create an object.

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,010
And I'm going to call it five books or five books.

68
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,730
OK, because this is an object nested within an array.

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,960
The first syntax is going to be an array and the array items are going to form like objects.

70
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,990
So the first item is going to be an object and we are going to say book name.

71
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,920
OK, this is our first key and I'm going to call it The Kite Runner.

72
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,850
Right.

73
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,070
And do not forget to separate them by comma.

74
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,030
And we are going to say author.

75
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,790
Or a huge or author is going to be let.

76
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,780
Hossaini.

77
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:29,900
All right, so this is our first loop item, and we we separate loop items by comma, so this is going

78
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,730
to be our second loop item.

79
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,110
We are going to have a book name and and an author.

80
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,520
So the book name.

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,120
This time it is going to be the theory of every thing.

82
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,520
And the author is, you guessed it right, Stephen Hawking.

83
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,220
Right.

84
00:05:51,340 --> 00:06:00,910
And finally, our final object or loop item is going to be the book name is going to be the it's not

85
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,670
going to be the is just going to be Moby Dick and author is.

86
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,840
Herman Melville.

87
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,570
Right, so let's save it.

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,190
So this is an object, this is objects nested within an array.

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,620
Right.

90
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,940
We can go ahead and consider log this this array of objects.

91
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,600
We can just say the name that is five books and we are going to get them.

92
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,680
So the length of this array is going to be three, but the index starts from one and is sorry from zero

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,900
and goes all the way to two.

94
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,160
So this is a representation of our array of objects.

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,540
We can go ahead and loop through this array with the same method.

96
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,810
OK, so what we are going to do is we are going to create a for loop structure first and then this time

97
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm going to call the loop variable I and we are going to say it starts from zero in the eye, goes

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,610
all the way to what, to five books that length.

99
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,600
Less than that.

100
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,040
Right.

101
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,780
And we are going to increment I by one.

102
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,740
So we wanted to start from zero and then go to one because it's incremented by one.

103
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,010
And then when increment one by one you get two.

104
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,460
And why the I should start from zero initially because the index is zero.

105
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,750
That's why it should start from zero.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,230
Right.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,050
And let's go ahead.

108
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,350
First off, log decipherable and we are going to get.

109
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,510
We are going to get all the indices right.

110
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,520
What we can do is we can log our array as well, along with the eye variable, and we are going to get

111
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,040
that the OK, there is a lot of information here.

112
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,570
So the index of zero is associated with this object.

113
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,360
Author of the book named Kite Runner, the index of One Theory of Everything and the index of two,

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,990
Moby Dick.

115
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,770
All right.

116
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,640
We can also access each individual object as well.

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,840
And I'm going to comment about these two.

118
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,480
So this is our our first object and our second and our third.

119
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,310
All right.

120
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,040
So that's it for this lecture.

121
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,040
See you guys in the next one.
