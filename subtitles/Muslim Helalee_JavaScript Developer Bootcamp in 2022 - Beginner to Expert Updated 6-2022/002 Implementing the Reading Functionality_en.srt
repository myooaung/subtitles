1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,990
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to implement the read text functionality.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,460
All right, all right, so first off, as with any other JavaScript project that we have created, we

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:22,470
are going to select the elements that we will be interacting with through JavaScript.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,970
So the first one that I want to select is going to be text display, and this is going to be our text

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,560
area.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,010
So we're going to say document that query selector and it has an idea of text.

7
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:46,300
The next thing that I want to select is Consed, come on buddy consed, it is going to be the speed

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,230
BTN or a button are going to say document dot query selector.

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,540
It has an idea of speed, not like the movie.

10
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,690
All right.

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,160
And what is this.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,080
I do not want it that way.

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,960
Then we have our red button read between.

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,920
You know what, I'm just going to remove this.

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,210
Right, let's remove it, let's copy it three times, one more time, so we are going to say this is

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,790
going to be read, right?

17
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,930
But this is a class I'm just going to provide it for all three of them.

18
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,970
The next one is going to be Paw's.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:43,260
OK, and finally, we have to stop, all right, so what I'm going to do is what what is it that we

20
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,990
want to do here?

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,320
So first off, let's open this one life server, and that's.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,900
Come on, buddy.

23
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,700
All right.

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,760
So we say that whenever we type something here and when we click on the read button, it should read

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:56,970
it.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,540
OK, it means that we want to click on the read button or we need an event listener.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,090
So I'm going to say reading functionality, right.

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm going to say a reading functionality.

29
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,960
And we are going to grab a read button and we are going to add a listener.

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,580
And the event that we are listening for is going to be a click, of course.

31
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,910
And when that happens, we are going to run a function.

32
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,940
OK, so what is the function going to do?

33
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,660
The function is going to call another read text function.

34
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,370
And as arguments inside this function call, they're going to pass in our text display because we want

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,820
an updated value value.

36
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,250
All right.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,460
So now let's come down here and let's create that read text function.

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:58,000
So we are going to say read text, text function.

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:08,010
OK, retakes function, so let's see how we can do it so we already know the name, which is read text

40
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,000
and we know the the we know that we have one argument inside the function call.

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,860
So for that argument, we need to provide a parameter, a parameter.

42
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,610
The parameter that I want to provide here is going to be text.

43
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,260
Right.

44
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,680
So this is going to be text.

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,070
Let's open up the function and in here, before even writing anything in the function function, we

46
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,200
need to take a look at something that is called speech synthetics utterance.

47
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,760
And I'm going to paste in the euro right here and it is not going to take long.

48
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,600
So speech, synthetic, synthetic utterance, interface of the Web speech API.

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,640
So now we are working with the Web speech.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,030
API represents a speech request.

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,550
It contains the content.

52
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,610
It contains the content, the speech service should read and information on how to read it.

53
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,310
Right, so first off, what we are going to do here is.

54
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,950
We are going to create a constant so I'm going to say const.

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,920
And I'm going to call it utterance.

56
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,399
All right, you can call it anything you want.

57
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,850
And in here, we need to create we need to request a speech Santarus, OK?

58
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,830
And through that, we can make the computer readout, our text.

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,980
And to be able to request that we are going to we are going to say speech Santarus.

60
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,900
Utterance, right, and just just like that, so we have requested that and we have stored it inside

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,130
this utterance and now through this utterance variable, we can grab methods of this speech synthesis

62
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,680
utterance.

63
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,480
Right.

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:04,460
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here and I'm going to say utterance, utterance, dot

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,400
text.

66
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,210
Right now, this is a property of the speech, synthetic utterance that is available to us.

67
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:17,210
And it says, Rantes, that utterance, that text equal to some sort of string.

68
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,350
What is that string that we want the computer to order out to us?

69
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,120
That is going to be equal to our parameter that we have passed right here.

70
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:27,810
Right.

71
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,720
So I could go ahead and change this a little bit up.

72
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,630
Change, change, change it up.

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,340
So this is not confused with this property.

74
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,390
We could change it.

75
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,960
Text, text, or should I call it a bit difficult to not lose the meaning.

76
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
So it's going to be test text

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,420
Ruden test.

78
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,940
I'm just going to call it test.

79
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,650
Test text.

80
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,330
I think it's not a problem.

81
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:11,360
All right, so after that, we have specified what we want our our insurance to do, what do we want

82
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,370
it to do now before going there?

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,970
What I want to do here is I want to consult.

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,990
I want to log to the console, our utterance and let's take a look at it.

85
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,030
What is it what is it exactly that we have here?

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,400
So let's go inspect and let's go into console.

87
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,320
So we are inside the console.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,790
All right.

89
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,890
And if I click on the read button, we are going to see here, it says speech, synthetics, utterance.

90
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,810
We have text.

91
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,550
We have text.

92
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,950
We have rate rate is negative one.

93
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,670
All right.

94
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:50,870
By default rate is the speed at which the computer is going to speak is going to be speaking.

95
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,260
So the text is as an empty string.

96
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,500
The text is something that we provided as developers or at the end user is going to provide it.

97
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,490
And we are going to be working with the range, with the right rate as well.

98
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,690
We don't want this pitch or the voice or anything else.

99
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,150
So we whenever we use speech, then that is utterance.

100
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
There are a set of properties and methods like any other object.

101
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,870
As you guys can see, this is an object.

102
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,010
Like any other object.

103
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,340
We have a set of properties and methods that are available to us that will be available to us as soon

104
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,720
as we specify speech.

105
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,140
And that is utterance that we can use inside our application.

106
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,470
That's where this text is coming from.

107
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,300
We use the dot notation to access the properties or methods of a specific object that we want to work

108
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,570
with.

109
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,700
Right.

110
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,600
So that's about that.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,660
And let's go ahead and let's say utterance that right now.

112
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,880
What do I want the rate of this utterance to be?

113
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,540
I want it to be the speed button that we have.

114
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,830
So if I increase the speed button, I want the speed at which the computer speaks to be faster or slower

115
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,990
if I like, decrease that speed.

116
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:11,090
OK, so I'm going to say that value because we need to grab the value and in case we do not touch the

117
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,670
speed, we want the default to be what you guys saw that the default rate is negative one, but we want

118
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,630
the default to be one.

119
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,070
So it's either of these either of these sites.

120
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,270
So this is a logic.

121
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,990
This is an or a logical operator.

122
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,000
It is going to evaluate to true one side of this expression.

123
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:37,039
And if it finds even one side that is evaluated, it's true this is going to return.

124
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,400
True.

125
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,350
So we either grab the speed button's value or we set it to one.

126
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,980
If we do not change that value we said it to on the reason that it is one is we have specified one here.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,510
So the minimum is zero.

128
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,180
Point one, the maximum extend, the step is zero.

129
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,520
Point one, the value is one.

130
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,970
That's why we specify one.

131
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,630
So it's either it should be one or the speed that we manually specify for it.

132
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,850
Right.

133
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:12,980
And I'm going to say text display dot disabled to true disabled.

134
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,230
I'm going to set it to trip.

135
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:21,140
And the reason that I said it's true is because this is another method that is available to us.

136
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:28,520
And whenever the computer is speaking, if I come here, for example, if I write this is a book, whenever

137
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,740
the computer is speaking, you can see that you cannot change the text while the computer is speaking.

138
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,700
That's why the text area is going to be disabled.

139
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:44,120
And finally, to make our computers speak, they are going to grab speech and that is.

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,430
And we are going to access a method called Speak Very, very simple, and inside there, we are going

141
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,710
to pass in our utterance.

142
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,640
Now that's come here.

143
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,450
Let's I'm going to grab our previous text.

144
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm going to paste it right here and I'm going to, you know, let's decrease this to here.

145
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,940
The quick brown box jumps over the lazy dog.

146
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,680
So now this text is read aloud.

147
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,680
OK, that is solved.

148
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,500
But there are quite a lot of issues.

149
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,570
The first thing is that our screen, our text area is disabled.

150
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,840
We have disabled it, but there is no way of enabling it again.

151
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,390
So we have to go ahead and we have to apply that functionality.

152
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,350
And also the pause button, the stop button, none of them work.

153
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,990
So let's see if the speed works or let's put it to four point seven.

154
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,410
There was nothing to write there.

155
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,470
I'm going to pasted there and put this to seven clicks.

156
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,650
So the speed definitely works.

157
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,260
But still, there are other issues that we need to fix, which we are going to do in our next lecture.

158
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,460
See you guys then.
