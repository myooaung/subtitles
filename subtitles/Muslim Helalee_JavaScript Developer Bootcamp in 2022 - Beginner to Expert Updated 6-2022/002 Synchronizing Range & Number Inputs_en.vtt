00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:08.080
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to synchronize the range input and the number input.

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.950
All right, so what do I exactly mean?

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.580
So this is the application where we are working, this is project number 18.

4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.840
Whenever it's project number 18, it's our current project.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.590
And whenever it doesn't say the number of project, then this is the final version that I've created

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.400
before recording.

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.810
All right.

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.480
So if I go ahead and if I decrease the number, the range, the number input is going to get decrease.

9
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.430
And if I increase it, the number input is going to get increased.

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.720
So this is the very first thing that real in JavaScript that we are going to attempt because we want

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.800
these two to be sync.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.460
So.

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.100
It doesn't matter if you grab the reins slider and go a go to like higher numbers, a higher number

14
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.069
of characters or lower, or you get the number and you just click the range, you can see that the range

15
00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.660
is actually moving like that.

16
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.260
All right.

17
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.870
So we want to synchronize them in this video.

18
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.700
So for that, let's head into our after JS file.

19
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.300
All right.

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.400
So first off, we are going to grab.

21
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.610
Our range Slider's so for the free range, for the input, which has a type of range, we have an idea

22
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.820
of range Dasch range of characters or range that are so I'm just going to call it characters range characters.

23
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.530
All right.

24
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.830
And we are going to say document dot, query selector.

25
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.170
I'm going to I'm going to you know what?

26
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.530
I'm not going to declare a selector.

27
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.160
I'm just going to do get Alamin by IED and I'm just going to pass and the ID we can do the same thing

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.900
for our number.

29
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.430
So let's just replace it to a number of characters.

30
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.580
All right.

31
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.110
So the next thing that I want to do is so for this video, this is the selection.

32
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.520
Of course, there is a lot more elements that we need to select.

33
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.080
Then we need to select and store inside variables inside our JavaScript file.

34
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.510
But we are going to do them whenever we get to those sections.

35
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.890
All right.

36
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.080
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to write, sing, run Zink, they spell it correctly.

37
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.030
I hope so.

38
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.210
Synchronising range and no inputs, right?

39
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.600
So so first stuff I want to do is I'm going to grab a range of characters and I'm going to add an event

40
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.060
listener to it and the event is going to listen for an input event.

41
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.560
All right.

42
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.620
So whenever we are changing our the number, the no input or the range input, the we are not looking

43
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.240
for a change event.

44
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.520
We are looking for an input often because their input form elements.

45
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.940
Right.

46
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.610
So whenever the event of input has been fired or has fired or has been received, we are going to run

47
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.860
a function that is called sync character amount.

48
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.790
Right.

49
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.960
And the reason that I call it this is synchronize the character amount because we are now working.

50
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.240
The first step is to work with the amount of characters that we want our application to have.

51
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.950
So that is going to be the first functionality of this application.

52
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.360
Now I'm going to do the same thing for our number of characters and in the process, no characters.

53
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.820
And in the process I'm going to call the same function.

54
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.980
So this is the good thing about functions.

55
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.020
Functions can be called multiple times.

56
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.430
All right.

57
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.990
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create the function.

58
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.290
So instead of and now this is what I've done differently.

59
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.550
We usually go ahead and create the function here and define the function inside the event.

60
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.500
Listener at the same time.

61
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.110
But now, because the function has been repeated twice, so there is no reason for me to define the

62
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.320
function once here and then a second time here, so I can just create the function down here and I can

63
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.880
call it multiple times.

64
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.990
That is like the basic ideology of functions.

65
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.080
So let's go ahead and let's create a function.

66
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.070
The function name, of course, is sync character amount.

67
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.210
And as an argument, as a parameter, we're going to pass in the event object and let's go ahead and

68
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.350
let's create a constant inside which we are going to store something.

69
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.750
So before doing that, let's go ahead and let's cancel log something.

70
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.510
Let's first of cancel Lagoa event object.

71
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.650
So what is our event object in this context and the context of this event, which is the input event?

72
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.820
What is our event object?

73
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.480
What does it contain?

74
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.450
So if I come here to Carnita, not sources console.

75
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.190
So now if I go ahead and if I click on any of them, this is our event.

76
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.630
And if I even click on this, we are going to get our event object.

77
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.540
So let's dive in there.

78
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.920
So this is our event.

79
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.310
All right.

80
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.330
What is the target?

81
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.700
This is what we are looking for usually.

82
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.060
All right.

83
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.870
So the target specifies where we have clicked.

84
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.760
Wherever you click, that is the target of our event object.

85
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.620
So you can see when I hover on it, it highlights this range slider.

86
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.450
So technically, if I hover on this target, it should highlight this no input and it does.

87
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.060
So we are going to grab our target and inside the target, what is it exactly that we want to grab?

88
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.840
It is the value of that specific input that we want to grab.

89
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.610
So let's go ahead.

90
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.520
Now, it says the value is, for example, three.

91
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.310
I'm going to trash it and I'm going to do it one more time, it says The Values for so let's go into

92
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.770
Target and let's look for value.

93
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.650
Evy, come on, the so did we pass it?

94
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.270
Where is the V?

95
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.760
Oh, feed value should be right here somewhere.

96
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.370
Is it alphabetical or not?

97
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.070
OK, let's look for it.

98
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.390
Where is the value?

99
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.180
I think the value does not come from here, I think it comes from here.

100
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.790
This is the value, right.

101
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.090
But I think we should be able to get it in here.

102
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.110
So this is event target.

103
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.960
These are all the methods.

104
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.220
I think it comes only from the from the e-mail.

105
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.440
I don't see it here.

106
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.290
And that's why we provided with Disvalue Attribute.

107
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.840
All right, no, no, it doesn't come from here.

108
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.650
So when we get the target, it means that we have successfully selected our input.

109
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.870
And now you see I just clicked on it.

110
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.300
So I'm just going to go go back to here.

111
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.290
So if I go ahead on the target and if I click, I'm redirected back to my e-mail.

112
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.770
This is the original markup.

113
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.660
And in here, dot value is going to give me this value.

114
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.750
This value is by default one, but we can change it.

115
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.480
Whenever I change this, the value is going to change.

116
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.980
So this is what the target value is going to give us.

117
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.250
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the EDAR target.

118
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.400
Dot value.

119
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:06.440
OK, and I'm going to store it inside a variable, the variable name, I'm going to call it value.

120
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.830
Amount.

121
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.600
All right.

122
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.920
All right, so this is the value amount.

123
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:22.740
Now, this is this is going to give us exactly the number of characters that we have because this value

124
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.270
is going to give us a number.

125
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:33.000
OK, and that number is the same for our input type of range and input type of number, because they

126
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.100
have the same minimum point and the same maximum point and the same value.

127
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.049
So now we can synchronize them.

128
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.790
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab my wrench characters variable and I'm going to say that

129
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:46.350
value.

130
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.800
And I'm telling it that your value should be the value amount.

131
00:08:51.560 --> 00:09:00.480
Also, the number of characters, and I'm telling this, that your value should also be the same thing.

132
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.540
So now the range characters value is value amount and the numbers character value is the value amount.

133
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.380
So let's save it.

134
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.200
Let's come here.

135
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.730
So technically now it should work.

136
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.020
There is a concern and, oh, here it is.

137
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:23.300
So if I click here now get you guys can see that the range is working because now both of them have

138
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.240
the same value.

139
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.420
So if I increase or decrease either of them, they are in sync.

140
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.290
All right.

141
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.510
So this is what I wanted to do in this lecture.

142
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.280
See you guys in the next one.
