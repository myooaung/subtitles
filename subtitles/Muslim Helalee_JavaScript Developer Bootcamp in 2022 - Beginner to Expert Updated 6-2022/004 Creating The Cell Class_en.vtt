00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:02.450
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.250
In this election, we are going to create the cell constructor.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.500
All right, before actually jumping there, what I'm going to do is I'm going to populate, I'm going

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.140
to say palm plating the grid.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.850
Let's go ahead and let's populate that.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.900
So what is the grid?

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.830
The grid is that entire thing that we that we see there.

8
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.180
Right.

9
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.450
So let's go ahead and let's populate that as well.

10
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.840
All right.

11
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:37.280
So in here, let's loop over all of the grid rows and great columns and then populate that empty grid

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.410
array with all the rows and columns that we loop over.

13
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.210
All right.

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.610
So what do we have here is we are going to sell it equal to zero.

15
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.340
We want to start from zero.

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.900
The I should go all the way to list and grid rows.

17
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.870
So the first thing that we are going to populate that empty array is with the grid rows.

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.650
So I'm going to grab that grid array and the first item that I want to pass and going to be the eye.

19
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.860
So the eye is going to be equal to an empty array.

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.310
So now the eye has has gone into that.

21
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.670
Right.

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.180
And now let's go ahead and let's grab all of the columns as well.

23
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.720
So I'm just going to call that.

24
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.800
You could call it anything you want, of course.

25
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.330
And we are going to say it should go all the way to less than the grid columns.

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.950
And we are going to increment by one each time.

27
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.970
And let's go ahead and let's create a left variable.

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.470
And we are going to say the left is going to be the margin X because we are talking about the landscape

29
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.920
mode in this case, plus the GAO, which is going to be the column that we have times, the cell that

30
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.960
we have there as well.

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.420
So the GAO is going to be each column that we have and in each column we are going to have, for example,

32
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.210
it is if it is column one, we are going to have sex cells in that.

33
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.220
So it is going to be cell one that's going to be one multiplied by two, multiplied by cell.

34
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.800
And we are going to give give it that margin as well.

35
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.370
So this is going to generate for a six cells there.

36
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.850
Let's go ahead and generate cells for the top.

37
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.400
For the top as well and for the top, you're going to grab the margin, why?

38
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.550
And I'm going to say plus I write.

39
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.690
So because this Jay is going to create for us columns.

40
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.740
But this but this is going to create for us rows and I'm going to multiply it by the cell size as well.

41
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.030
Now, let's grab our empty grid and they're going to pass and I as the grid rose and I'm going to pass

42
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.400
and just as the grid columns and now here is where I'm going to call in our new cell class, which we

43
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.980
have not yet created, but we are going to create it.

44
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.780
So I'm going to pass in the left.

45
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.760
That's capitalized that I'm going to pass and left and I'm going to pass it right as arguments.

46
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.970
Now, Write-up.

47
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.510
And I'm going to pass on the cell, so the Highton with the Highton with are going to be the and width

48
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.480
of the cell and the arrow is going to be the eye and the column is going to be teacher.

49
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.690
So let's save it.

50
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.180
And I'm going to come on top of this on top of the game loop.

51
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.620
And in here I'm going to create the cell class.

52
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.560
All right, so let's go ahead and let's create that as well, so let's say class cell, keep in mind

53
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.670
it should be capital, the first letter and you're going to create a constructor here.

54
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.340
So now we have passed in six arguments for each of the arguments.

55
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.430
We are going to need six parameters.

56
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.210
So the first one was what was it?

57
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.790
So the first one was the left, then top.

58
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.600
So we need to call those as well.

59
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.670
So for the left, you are going to pass and left.

60
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.030
For the top, you are going to pass and top this is going to be with this is going to be the height.

61
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240
This is going to be the row and this is going to be the call.

62
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.589
So we are going to say this dot left.

63
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.300
What is this so this the left is going to be called to left, right?

64
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.890
What is going to be the right?

65
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.500
What do you think is going to be the right?

66
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.520
So let's create that.

67
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.440
As well, so we always know that whenever we are moving to any side that from left to right or right

68
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.920
to left, it's there with that we are actually dealing with.

69
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:50.940
So I'm just going to pass and let's create this top is going to be going to top this start bottom is

70
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.240
going to be equal to top in this case.

71
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.250
It's not going to be with but height.

72
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.720
Let's create the with the start with is going to be equal to with this height is going to be equal to

73
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.570
height, right.

74
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.340
And now let's create the rows of this row.

75
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:22.870
This row is going to be equal to Roe and the START column is going to be equal to column for that there.

76
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.010
And now I want to create a centers for our circles as well.

77
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.000
For example, the center in the direction, the center for the Y Direction.

78
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.920
So I'm just going to say let center X be equal to because it's that center point around which that circle

79
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.700
is being drawn.

80
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.830
So the center for the along the direction is going to be left, plus the width divided by two because

81
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.800
we need to get the radius if we just left plus with it is going to give us the diameter, but we need

82
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.220
to divide it by two so we get the width.

83
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.250
So sorry, we get the radius.

84
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.750
So this is going to be Htar Plus.

85
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:13.010
And this is going to be center why let's grab the let's create that the radius as well.

86
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.630
This is going to be the center point.

87
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.860
That's why we have divided it by two, because the radius is going to go inside the center point.

88
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.930
So this study is going to be a radius and we are going to grab our width, multiply it by grid circle.

89
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.340
What is the grid circle?

90
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.130
The grid circle is actually a fraction of the cell size, right.

91
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.970
And let's divide it by two again, because we need to get the radius and let's create the highlight

92
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.450
as well.

93
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.450
I'm just going to create it.

94
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.150
Well, we should create it later, but I'm just going to create it now so I don't have to come back

95
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.480
to it.

96
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.730
So high light.

97
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.330
This should be highlight, I always misspell this one.

98
00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:05.380
And equal to highlight, perfect, and let's create the cell owner as well, who who's who's ever or

99
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.590
whomsoever has to play the game is the owner of the cell.

100
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.140
So, for example, if I come here, you can see now I am the owner of the if I click now, computer

101
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.090
is the owner and now I am the owner.

102
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.000
So it depends.

103
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.510
Is this going to switch?

104
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.820
And I'm just going to put it to for now because but OK, this is not as well because by default we do

105
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:32.230
not want to highlight anything until we find out whose turn it is or who is the owner of that.

106
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.900
OK, let's move on.

107
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:45.770
What I'm going to do here is I'm going to draw the circle as well, so I'm going to say the draw circle

108
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.880
function.

109
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.940
Where is the sea?

110
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.470
There we go, there is the sea.

111
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.790
Say, draw and.

112
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.520
I'm going to pass in the canvass context canvass.

113
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:11.670
Canvas, canvas, context as a parameter and in here, first off, let's create the owner color, so

114
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.100
let color be equal to now in here.

115
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.830
But I'm going to do is something that we have never done in discourse before.

116
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.440
I'm going to change ternary operators.

117
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:32.270
So if it is null, if null is true, then it means that we just want to show the color of the background.

118
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.950
So I'm just going to tell you so you can see that if it is null, we show the color of the background

119
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.409
and then we need to find out the owner.

120
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:47.650
If the owner is true, we either show the color for the R.I in this case or we show the color for the

121
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:47.950
air.

122
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.020
That's how we change.

123
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.820
So if null is true, we show the background color.

124
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.190
And if this dot owner is true, what do we show.

125
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.800
We show the color for the r.i.

126
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:09.000
Or the color for the air, color for the ivory.

127
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.860
There we go, there is the air.

128
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.560
Now, let's go ahead and let's draw the circle.

129
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:21.620
So we are going to say drawing the circle right now before drawing actually the circle.

130
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:28.410
What I need to do, we if I remember correctly, we drew the background, but we didn't call that function.

131
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.370
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go to my game loop.

132
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.190
I just want to draw that so you can really see that background.

133
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.640
And in here, I'm just going to write draw functions.

134
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.200
You're are going to get to that in just a sec and just going to call the drawback, right?

135
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.280
And there is another function that is going to be drug grade, which we are going to create as well.

136
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.350
And I'm just going to put these here.

137
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:54.270
Right.

138
00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:04.420
So if I come here and with is not the detach 107, let's go to one hundred and seven.

139
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.580
The this is the width is not defined.

140
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.750
We have not provided it the width.

141
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:18.390
OK, so so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create some game variables as well.

142
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.460
So below this cell class.

143
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.350
I'm going to write game variables, right, and OK, so what is the first variable I'm going to call

144
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.440
it game over.

145
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.680
We have not created we have not declared it yet, but we are going to do that.

146
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.590
And then the next one is going to be game tied.

147
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:45.020
Whenever the game is tied, then we are going to have our grid, which are which we are going to initialize

148
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.100
to an empty array.

149
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.210
And then right after that, we are going to have our players turn whichever players turn Daris.

150
00:10:53.390 --> 00:11:00.200
And then we are going to specify a time for the ehi, the time that the A.I. is going to take in order

151
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.310
to make its move.

152
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.260
I'm going to call the canvas dimensions as well in here.

153
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.630
So I'm going to say canvas dimensions.

154
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.770
Dimension's.

155
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:26.040
So let's grab the now here is where I'm going to define the width and then the height and then the margin,

156
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.810
I know we did not define the margin.

157
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.000
So this is where I'm going to define them.

158
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.710
And this should be a common.

159
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:40.730
All right, so there we go with that and also let's call Andy said dimension's, it's called Let's save

160
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.480
it now.

161
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.660
Drug trade is not defined.

162
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.810
We are going to define that and are right.

163
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.470
There we go.

164
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.200
So we see a black screen, which we should not see.

165
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.680
Let's go ahead and let's try to complete this.

166
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.430
Hopefully, we should get rid of that.

167
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.160
This is not yet defined.

168
00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.590
That's why the error happened.

169
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.830
So whenever I draw that function, then we are going to call it so let's do that.

170
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.950
And we see a black you should not see that.

171
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.910
It's the background S9 nine color B.G..

172
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.280
Let's come down here.

173
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.640
We have our set dimensions function there.

174
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.680
All right, so for now, I'm just going to ignore that black background and we are going to because

175
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.170
there is a lot of things that we have not completed yet.

176
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:33.680
We need to draw the we need to we need our draw function to draw the circle and we need to grab the

177
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.740
canvas context, context.

178
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.320
And I'm going to say that Phil style.

179
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.600
We are going to set it to the caller, which where is it?

180
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.080
Which, yeah, there it is, it is going to specify one of the colors for us.

181
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.970
I'm going to come down and let's go ahead and let's begin the path, so begin path.

182
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.830
And.

183
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.780
Right after that, let's grab Warraq method arc.

184
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.760
So what is going to be the with we I told you guys that the width is going to be the center that we

185
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.660
have provided.

186
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.830
We want it to start at that specific center.

187
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:21.230
So we are going to say center X first and then center Y.

188
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:29.720
The radius is going to be that this hour that we have specified up there, the starting angle is going

189
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.350
to be zero.

190
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.670
The ending angle is going to be math that PI times two.

191
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:39.590
And let's grab the the film method, not the stroke.

192
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:40.850
All right.

193
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:41.620
Let's save it.

194
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.580
And right after that, what I want to do is I want to draw the highlighting as well.

195
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.090
So in here, I'm just going to say draw highlighting.

196
00:13:52.340 --> 00:14:00.110
And for this, we need a condition because whenever it is the users turn or the eyes turn, we want

197
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.180
a different color for the highlighting.

198
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.730
Whenever it is the computer's turn, we want a different color for the highlighting for the user.

199
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.380
We want that orange that you saw for the computer.

200
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.870
We want that green which you saw as well.

201
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:20.030
So we are going to say if this first off, we need to check if there is any place for us to provide

202
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.680
our highlight.

203
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:27.650
So we are going to say if this does highlight is not equal to no, it means that there is actually some

204
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.570
place for us to provide our highlight.

205
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:35.900
If if that column is full of the column is full, we are not going to provide any highlight, for example,

206
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.560
like this.

207
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:44.380
The computer is going to win there and you can see that in this column, we can no longer have any highlights.

208
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.310
So first off, we need to check if it is if it isn't and know.

209
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:49.670
Right.

210
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.770
And then let's go ahead and let's grab the color.

211
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.840
So we are going to say color should be equal to now.

212
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.210
Here is where we're going to define the highlight color.

213
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.590
So this start highlight.

214
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.810
If this not highlight, it's true.

215
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.800
We are going to grab the color for the r.i so color for the r.i.

216
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:22.330
Otherwise if this that highlight is not true we are going to grab the color for the eye color and score.

217
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.980
So let's grab that as well.

218
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.510
Now let's actually draw that highlight that we have.

219
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:39.380
So I'm going to say draw a circle around the perimeter perimeter that's around the perimeter.

220
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.800
Right.

221
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.670
Perimeter, perimeter.

222
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:51.830
All right, so let's grab our canvasses context line with because this is going to have a width, it's

223
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.510
not a complete circle.

224
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.520
It's just like a stroke of a circle.

225
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.450
Right.

226
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.780
So the line with what is the width of that stroke?

227
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.600
The width of that stroke is going to be one fourth of the radius of the circle.

228
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:11.120
What do I mean by this so you can see that the this circle that is being highlighted here, this is

229
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:17.420
what what we are actually creating right now and let's grab the canvas is context.

230
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.630
Let's say stroke, because we are creating stroke.

231
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:27.200
We are going to say stroke style equal to the color, whichever color it might be, it might be the

232
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.980
color are already color A.I. Let's begin our path and are right.

233
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.670
So it is going to be exactly like this.

234
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.290
I'm just going to copy that and I'm going to put it right here.

235
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.750
So we have begun our path.

236
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:48.860
It's going to have a center X, it is going to have a center wide radius and also that and finally,

237
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.960
instead of saying canvas context fell, we are going to say stroke.

238
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.160
Perfect.

239
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:04.319
Let's do that and finally, the in here after the game variables, what I want to do is I want to create

240
00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.310
an event.

241
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:11.900
And that is going to be window resized, so window.

242
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:22.170
Resize event listener, this is the event that we are going to listen for whenever the user resize is

243
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.990
the window, a.k.a. for responsiveness.

244
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:31.220
So first off, I'm going to grab the window and I'm going to add a listener.

245
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.040
We have not talked about this event, but it is going to be the resize event.

246
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:41.970
And whenever the user realizes we are going to call the set dimensions function.

247
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.910
Right.

248
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:48.320
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to cut that and I'm going to put it underneath the dimensions.

249
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.810
These are going to be our game variables, all of this.

250
00:17:53.010 --> 00:18:00.090
All right, on top of that, I'm going to grab our canvas element and I'm going to add an event listener

251
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:08.850
to that as well whenever any whenever the user mouse is over, any of the any part of the canvas, we

252
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.120
need to highlight that grid that we have.

253
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:18.780
So I'm just going to person mouse move and then we are going to create a function for highlighting the

254
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.200
grid.

255
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:20.910
Perfect.

256
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.860
All right, I hope you're not getting confused, I'm sure you're not.

257
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.240
This is very, very simple.

258
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:34.570
So before actually creating this highlight grid function, you remember that I passed in here a draw

259
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.930
a grid function there.

260
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:41.870
And what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to draw that grid that we

261
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.150
have.

262
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.210
I'm going to go underneath this.

263
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.850
Where is our drawback, Grant?

264
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.250
We call the drawback ground there and in here.

265
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:54.870
I'm just going to I'm going to call the one to create the draw grid function.

266
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.080
Let's let's draw the grid as well.

267
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.810
So first off, what we need to draw is going to be the frame and the bottom of the frame, and then

268
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.450
we are going to draw ourselves.

269
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.640
So we are going to say function.

270
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.810
Function, draw.

271
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:22.180
Drug gret, let me come and this, yeah, it is coming, and so we are going to draw that perfect.

272
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.010
So first off, the frame, which is going to contain all of this, all the circles and the bottom of

273
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.570
the frame, perfect.

274
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.030
Let's say, what is the cell?

275
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.040
The cell is going to be each of the cells that we want to draw.

276
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:42.730
They're going to have a a row of zero and they're going to have a column of zero.

277
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:49.330
Then we are going to we need to grab the frame height h e t.

278
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.630
So we need to specify that as well.

279
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:59.270
So these cells, these cells hide these cells hide times.

280
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.690
The red rose is going to be the frame height.

281
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.070
So as many rows as we have that is going to specify the grid height.

282
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.090
So the frame height then we have our frame with.

283
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.390
The frame with is going to be the width of the cells divided by the number of columns that we have.

284
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:25.160
So the number of columns right after that, I'm going to call our canvas context and I'm going to say

285
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.120
Phil style.

286
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:34.610
And we are going to we are going to grab the color of the frame, so the color of the frame and I'm

287
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.600
going to say canvas context, but let's fill that as well.

288
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.440
Fill in RACT.

289
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.840
And what is the exposition, the exposition is going to be the left side of the cell.

290
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.780
What is the Y position?

291
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.810
Cells top is going to be the Y position.

292
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.370
What is the with the width is going to be the frame with what is the height?

293
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.010
The fight is going to be the frame height.

294
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:07.200
And let's grab the canvas context one more time and let's say, OK, fair style.

295
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.510
Now we have specified our we have created the frame.

296
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.670
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create that bottom part, that bottom rectangle that you see

297
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.140
as well.

298
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.980
So I'm going to say frame, color, frame, bottom, pretty descriptive name.

299
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.760
And let's grab the canvas, fill rect.

300
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.480
All right, so what is the with the with is going to be the left side of the cells minus both sides

301
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.160
of the margin, that is going to be the width of that that that we have.

302
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.560
Right.

303
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.570
So the cells left side.

304
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.940
Or the left sells minus the margins on both of the sides.

305
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:55.240
I'm going to say margin times two, that is going to be the exposition sorry, this is going to be the

306
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.660
exposition, not the with what is going to be the Y position.

307
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.780
The Y position is always going to be at the bottom of the frame.

308
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.050
Right.

309
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.970
So this very far point, this is the Y position.

310
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.210
So let's draw that as well.

311
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:13.270
So Saldate top plus the frames hide the frames.

312
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.870
Height is going to give us the final point for that frame.

313
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.120
And we need to always subtract the margin on the both sides.

314
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.430
So we are going to say margin margin times two.

315
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:32.620
But because we are actually going down, I'm just going to go ahead and multi-device, divided by two.

316
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.650
We need to subtract it by the margin.

317
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.560
Times to.

318
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.110
Perfect.

319
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:44.700
So this is going to be the X and the Y values for that, the X and Y locations.

320
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.350
Now let's grab the with the with is going to be the frame with plus the margin.

321
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.700
All right, and the height is just going to be the margin size itself.

322
00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:01.210
Now, whenever we draw that, you're going to see that the margin height as well.

323
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.450
And finally, we are going to say canvas context.

324
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.550
Dot fell.

325
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.960
All right, and now that is created, let's create ourselves as well.

326
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:17.570
I'm just going to create that and we are going to grab the rest of the game in the next lecture.

327
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.040
So here I'm going to I'm going to call and we're going to use a four of loop.

328
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.760
I'm not sure if we have covered that.

329
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.980
We have covered a ton inside this course.

330
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.410
But what it is, what it is going to do is it is going to have a loop variable, which in this case

331
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:37.810
is row, and it is going to loop over a loop array, which is great.

332
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:45.850
So we want our road to loop over the grid itself and then we want our cell to.

333
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:55.620
To look over all the rows, so we are going to say for let's row off grid, this is the loop variable,

334
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.390
which is going to loop over this array.

335
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.870
This is the loop variable.

336
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.360
We know that all of our rows and columns, they are going to be inside an array.

337
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.450
So this is going to be one array.

338
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.140
We have specified it right there and the other one is going to be another.

339
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.090
That's why we are looping over that.

340
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.850
And then we are going to call in called a draw function or a drum method.

341
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:18.660
Right.

342
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.650
And this is just going to grab any canvas, the canvas context.

343
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.580
So let's save it.

344
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.710
All right.

345
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.960
So I think we are done here.

346
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.140
We have drawn the grid.

347
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.510
We have drawn the French top and bottom location.

348
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.850
We have drawn ourselves.

349
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.090
Now we should see something on the screen.

350
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.740
There we go.

351
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:40.860
So if I refresh the page, there is something wrong, because I know that the frame is is fine.

352
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.840
We have all our cells are our grid.

353
00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.670
So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

354
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.320
We don't see any highlighting because we have not drawn the highlighting.

355
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.910
But this color of the background, that is sort of messed up.

356
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.320
So let's set dimensions.

357
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.910
Where did we define the background?

358
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.310
So this is where we said draw the background.

359
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.290
The color should be the color.

360
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.480
Viji It's not taking this color for some reason.

361
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.310
So let me just specified as red.

362
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.840
Let's see if it grabs that.

363
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.000
No, it is not driving.

364
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.920
This color should grab this color.

365
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.730
Color Biji, so let me take a look at it.

366
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.100
We have our grid there.

367
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.540
We have created all the grid, the rows and we have put everything inside that grid array.

368
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.060
We have created the grid right there, create grid and.

369
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:40.200
Called it there we have our drug background, we have called it right here, so it is constantly drawing

370
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.550
the background that we have.

371
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.130
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

372
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.460
We should see that color, not this color.

373
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:57.570
All right, so the only thing left here that I want to do is I just want to fix this issue so you can

374
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:05.190
see that the color of the carpet for our frame and bottom, this color and the bottom color, I hope

375
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.940
they are the same.

376
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.140
I think they're the same.

377
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.010
They are what we what we want them to be, they are the color of the frame and the color of the bottom

378
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.390
and this color, this is the drug background.

379
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.370
So that's this function.

380
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:25.860
We have canvas, that style color, big canvas, fellin ract.

381
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.500
And this is somehow not so.

382
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.570
Oh, there we go.

383
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.330
There is a team missing there.

384
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.720
So if I save it, we can see that the color is back to what it should be.

385
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.800
But now there is a problem that the color of these circles is not.

386
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.450
And you can see the bottom is perfect.

387
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.360
The color of these circles is not.

388
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:51.420
It should be white if the if the circles they do not have any owner there.

389
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.910
Color should be the color of the background.

390
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.600
Where have we specified the color of the circles.

391
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.510
We have specified it drawing the circle right here.

392
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.530
So we have said the first.

393
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:04.650
There we go.

394
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.950
We see a team missing there as well.

395
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.450
So if I say it and now we can see it gives us the green, it shouldn't give us the long green because

396
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.620
now it means that the owner is actually the A.I. It's not the r.i.

397
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.880
It shouldn't be anyone unless someone has selected it.

398
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.360
So we say that color if color.

399
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.190
This is not correct if this dog owner.

400
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:40.800
Let me clear that so if this dog owner equals normal, then we want the color to be color, color of

401
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.600
the background.

402
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:49.530
Otherwise, if this stud owner is true, I mean, if it is not, then we we want that color.

403
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.990
If it is true, this dog owner, it means that there is an owner.

404
00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:00.150
We either want the color of the RIAA or the color of the EHI that this entire thing is going to be equal

405
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.000
to the color.

406
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.170
So if I say it.

407
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.730
There we go.

408
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.860
So this is our frame.

409
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:11.640
This is the bottom of the frame that we have, because these frames, they don't have any specific owner

410
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.970
or their color is the color of the background.

411
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:15.580
Right.

412
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:22.470
And the next thing that we would do, the next logical thing that we would do is we are going to grab

413
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.130
the highlight.

414
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:23.490
Great.

415
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.020
And we are going to create that.

416
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:31.830
And from the highlight, great, we are going to create the highlight sell so we can actually highlight

417
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.940
the cells that we have on him, which we are going to complete in our next lecture.

418
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.170
See you guys then.
