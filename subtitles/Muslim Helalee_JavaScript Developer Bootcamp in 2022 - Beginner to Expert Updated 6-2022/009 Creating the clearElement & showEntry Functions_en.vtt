00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.670
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.080
In this lecture, we are going to create a clear element and a show entry function.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.480
All right, so first off, we have called the clear element here.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.780
Now let's go ahead and let's create the function.

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.030
I know this is not the major focus here in this lesson, I just want to get it over with.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.400
I just want to get it done so it is clear and put such a clear element.

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.010
And we are going to have multiple elements and we are going to run a full bridge on these elements.

8
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:48.350
So we are going to say for each and whenever this for each loop runs with the element loop variable,

9
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.270
we are going to run this function and this function is going to grab our element.

10
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:04.310
Element, and we are going to grab the enriched HTML and we are going to set it to an empty string,

11
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.310
that's.

12
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.150
So this is the clear element that means we are clearing things out.

13
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.780
All right.

14
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.150
Now, for the major function, it is show entry function.

15
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.790
I mean, what I wanted to do here is this is a confession.

16
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.960
I why wanted to call this function inside this updated function and then go ahead and define the function.

17
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.470
But I thought like that that's not how like that is not a good way of teaching.

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890
So we have done that a lot here.

19
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.160
OK, but you should be able to do that as well to do what we did to call the function and then create

20
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.690
the function.

21
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100
That's what professionals do.

22
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.910
But for teaching purposes, we should first define the function and then call the function.

23
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.940
So like all of you have, like a clear understanding of why do we need to define that function?

24
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.750
What does that function do?

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.820
It's like the update UI function and you're saying, OK, you're driving me mad.

26
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.780
Why do why do we need the update UI when we just like called it inside this budget in.

27
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.970
So what I'm going to do.

28
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.410
Now the reason that I called this update UI was because this is like a really, really large function

29
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.120
and it encapsulates like most of this application.

30
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.310
So that's why I called it.

31
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.190
And then as you can see, that there are several lectures that include like creating this function.

32
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.690
So this is the creation of the UI function spans over many lectures.

33
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.560
So let's create the show entry function.

34
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.270
And now I'm going to pass in five parameters and I'm going to tell you why for each of them.

35
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.120
So the first one is the list.

36
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.350
This list.

37
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.600
Excuse me, this list relates to the show entry.

38
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:06.120
And this list is basically related to where where do we want to insert this show entry?

39
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.030
So this is not actually related to that show entry.

40
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.020
This is related to our lists.

41
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.570
What are our lists?

42
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.950
We have three different kind of lists.

43
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.330
So we have our income list, expense list and all list.

44
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.000
We have selected all all of them.

45
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.120
And if you and if I remember correctly, we have cleared all three of them here as well.

46
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.980
Now, whenever we clear them, we need to repopulate them again.

47
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.690
So we need our last because we want our show entry.

48
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.290
We want our entry to belong to a specific list.

49
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.620
So it is going to be either income tracker or the expense structure.

50
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.390
So that's why we need to specify to which list it belongs.

51
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.600
Second, we need to grab the type of that list because based on the type, we want to give it like a

52
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.380
different background color, a different color.

53
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.780
We want to based on this type, we want to either apply, we want to add it to the income or added to

54
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.530
the outcome.

55
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.860
And based on that, we are going to decide on the side of this balance.

56
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.800
So that's why the type then the title, you know why the title is the title of the budget, then the

57
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.410
amount which doesn't require any explanation.

58
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.260
And then the idea now this IED, we are going to use a lot.

59
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.930
We are going to use not a lot.

60
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.450
Very, very crucial.

61
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.970
Each item is going to have one IED.

62
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.950
I can show you that here.

63
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.900
I can say not there.

64
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.130
I can say a rent.

65
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.980
I don't know why it didn't save salary.

66
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.530
That would have been much easier.

67
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.300
So if I come in to inspect and let's go, where am I, where I'm into application and if I come here

68
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.420
and now you can see that this has an idea of zero.

69
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.430
And if I add another object that is going to have an idea of one.

70
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.880
So SFD 50 once like five or five click now it has an idea of one.

71
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.090
So each item which we add is going to be added to the to the top of the list.

72
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.880
That's why we need the idee.

73
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.460
Ah, right here, right now, let's clear this.

74
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.360
OK, so I'm going to create a constant and I'm going to call it entry, and now here is the power of

75
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.200
the back ticks.

76
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.930
All right, I'm just going to put the back to you right here, and what I'm going to do is I'm going

77
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:41.580
to create an ally because our list is actually a useful so the proper child for a well is and a lot

78
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.130
we are going to give it an ID.

79
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.400
Keep in mind, I just showed you the I.D. is a number.

80
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:55.710
So for the I.D., I'm going to pass an I.D., which is not there inside this.

81
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.170
And you can see that this is activated.

82
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.380
And I hope that you can see this is like visible because this is a screen recording.

83
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:13.080
This list is like a bit like grayed out, but this is like a bit more like shiny like cholerae, because

84
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.740
this is this has been defined right here, has been called there.

85
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.040
Then we are going to say we are going to give it a class.

86
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.200
Now, the class is really cool because the class is going to grab the tie.

87
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.630
So if it is an expense, it is going to have a type of expense.

88
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.390
If it is income, it is going to have sorry.

89
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.630
If it is expense, it is going to have a class of expense.

90
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.890
If it is an income, it is going to have a class of income.

91
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.510
And now this is our element.

92
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.450
What are the children for the element.

93
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.780
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to create the ending tag with one slash.

94
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.650
Not not like that.

95
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.000
Very, very humiliating.

96
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.370
Let's grab this back, take put it right here, so the children, we're going to use the nesting of

97
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.910
HTML elements.

98
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.170
That's why I'm just going to, like, hit like a tub inside this element right here when I save it.

99
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.570
Of course, this is going to pretty it on itself.

100
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.110
So inside this Allai, what do I want?

101
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.750
I want to think originally the first thing is going to be one diff.

102
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.930
Nundah diff is going to include is going to include our title and our amount.

103
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.080
I'm going to come here until our income tracker and I'm going to say salary.

104
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.670
Why do I keep doing that salary and I'm going to say 1500?

105
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.690
So we have the title, see the salaries, the title, and then we have Colen and then we have the dollar

106
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.170
sign and then we have the amount.

107
00:07:53.610 --> 00:08:02.360
So we are going to create this illi in this order or to make it even shorter and cooler for you.

108
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:09.750
You can see that this allai has a different side of it with this information and another div which houses

109
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.880
both of the icons.

110
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.010
So we are going to create it this way.

111
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.140
So let's come here.

112
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.600
Let's say def.

113
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:26.760
This debate is going to have a class, the class is going to be make sure you spell everything correctly.

114
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:32.010
If you don't, this is not going to work and there is no Intellisense helping.

115
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.159
You know, Emet here, you just have to do it by heart.

116
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:44.610
So we have our title, then the colon, then the dollar sign, and then we have our amount.

117
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.670
Now, keep in mind that this dollar sign belongs to stimulus strength.

118
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.770
The other dollar sign, which is yellow, it is the regular dollar sign.

119
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.120
So there are two of them.

120
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.500
One is for templated strength.

121
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.500
We have another d'Hiv here as well.

122
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:09.150
And that if we are going to give it a class of action, which I'm sure you have, you remember the action

123
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.830
class from our C assess.

124
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.430
And inside here, I'm just going to hit one space and we are going to create an icon.

125
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.500
Now, I have inserted the font awesome icon link.

126
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.280
Now I'm going to create an icon element and give it the class.

127
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.350
So it's like any regular icon, but like specific classes.

128
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.810
If they are so the first icon is going to be a dead F a dash edit.

129
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.730
And now let's let's close this as well.

130
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.760
They are, they are o tags like complete tags.

131
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.650
So for the trash is going to be faez we can pass in a trash.

132
00:09:54.730 --> 00:10:01.420
If a trash so this is OK, we have created a weird, dynamic element, where do we want to insert it?

133
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.730
So we are going to create a position.

134
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:16.620
Const consed position, position and the position, I think it was a over to do that we did before and

135
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:22.290
but here we are going to do after Biggin we ha we talked about how there are four positions.

136
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.990
I gave you the resource, you can go ahead and check it there and then we are going to where do we want

137
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.490
inserted.

138
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.100
So we declared the position.

139
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.230
We know where the position is but where is it actually on the web page.

140
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.970
So we are going to grab our list.

141
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:44.550
Now keep in mind the list has not been in and has not been specified yet because this list is a parameter

142
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.440
for this function.

143
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.300
This list could be the income tracker, the expense structure or the all list.

144
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.480
We are going to specify that in our next structure.

145
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.880
But for now, we are just going to add it to that list, whichever list that is.

146
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.140
So we are going to say insert adjacent HTML.

147
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:11.370
Some methods don't work and OK, we are going to insert the position and the element, the element is

148
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.140
going to be entry.

149
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.890
So our element has been successfully created.

150
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.980
Now what do we need to do as we need to insert it to as to a specific list?

151
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.720
And what what is that list, we are going to find that out in our next lecture.

152
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.040
See you guys then.
