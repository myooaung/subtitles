00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.970
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to create drugs, start and drug and event listeners.

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.600
All right, so first things first.

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.950
Let's grab the elements that we want to work with.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.770
The first one is going to be our lists.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.520
All right.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.370
Now, these lists, they are actually the.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:31.180
This is a very this list is this very variable name inside which we are going to store these four lists,

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.530
containers, right.

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.250
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say query selector all because there are four of them.

10
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.580
Right, and each one of them has a class of list, the next thing is we are going to grab our list items

11
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.120
as well.

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.570
These are the ones that we are going to grab and lists are the ones that we are going to place them

13
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.840
in.

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.880
Right.

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.280
So we are also going to say document that query selector all because there are eight lists.

16
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.710
So I'm just going to say it all and you're going to select them by their class, which is a list item.

17
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.840
All right.

18
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.640
So what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to initiate I'm going to create a variable that is

19
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.900
called dragged the item and I'm going to set it initially to know.

20
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.430
All right.

21
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.370
Because we are going to change its value later on, so let's go ahead and let's create a for loop because

22
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.960
there are multiple lists.

23
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.790
We want to apply a function whenever the user or an event listener on each of these lists, whenever

24
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.100
the user grabs them.

25
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.560
Right.

26
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.520
So let's go ahead and let's say we could do that for each.

27
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.520
We could do for each.

28
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.010
But I don't want to do it in this lecture because I want to use for loops, for arrays as well, because

29
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.990
actually for each is like the hot new thing that is used for a race.

30
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.270
But we can use for loops as well, like regular old for for loops.

31
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.539
So I'm just going to use that.

32
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.850
And so the loop variable is going to be a and we are going to say it is going to start from zero.

33
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.420
The air is going to go all the way to list.

34
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.430
List items that length less than that, and whenever we do this, it means that we are actually targeting

35
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.270
the index.

36
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:38.280
So if we have eight list items, the index, the index of the last item is going to be seven, but the

37
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.990
length is eight.

38
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.360
Right.

39
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.210
So seven is one less than eight.

40
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.110
That's why we say list items that length less than this.

41
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.010
And let's increment it by one each time that this happens.

42
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.410
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a constant and I'm going to call it item and we are

43
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.610
going to set it to list items and our Aluf variable.

44
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.910
Let's go ahead and let's consider log there so we can see what is it that we are getting right now at

45
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.550
this point.

46
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.060
So let's come in here.

47
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.250
So this is our project.

48
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.820
Let's open up or inspect.

49
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.730
And let's going to console so if I remove this and now let's go ahead and let's refresh the page, we

50
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.620
are going to get all of our eight alist items right.

51
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.450
So we have just gotten all of them.

52
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.570
And it means that we are selecting them correctly.

53
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.980
Right.

54
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.670
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say items that add event listener.

55
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.820
So each time one of those event, one of those items is selected, I want to run an event.

56
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.110
The event is not going to be a click event.

57
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.920
It is going to be a drag sturdevant drag sturdevant.

58
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.790
Right.

59
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.140
And when this event happens, I want to run a function.

60
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.670
Or whenever I receive this input by this by the user dysfunctionality, when the user does this Dreux

61
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.540
start, when the drug is started for the item, I want to implement something.

62
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.130
I want to grab our drug at item variable and I want to set it to our item.

63
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.130
So whichever item that the user has clicked on is going to be our drug item.

64
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.670
And now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to grab our I'm going to grab our item.

65
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.050
And I'm going to say style dot, OK, style the display.

66
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.490
That display should be equal to.

67
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.440
Not all right.

68
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.980
So I'm going to say that the reason that I've done this is we are going to go into our final into our

69
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.960
finished application.

70
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.740
So if I were to grab this item number eight and just move it like even by one millimeter, then this

71
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.040
item number eight is actually removed from this container.

72
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.430
It is not actually removed.

73
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.550
It is just received a display of nine none.

74
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.770
The reason that this happens is whenever we selected and grab it until we release it somewhere, this

75
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.930
item is like in the hover.

76
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.220
It's like hovering.

77
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.300
It's on the cloud.

78
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.090
These are not proper terminologies that I use here.

79
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.460
It means that the item doesn't have a specific place.

80
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.280
You could call this item a homeless item.

81
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.480
All right.

82
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.620
Because it has been removed from its home and it is looking for a home.

83
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.200
We could drop it in its original home or in in three different other homes.

84
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.970
But whenever you grab it and even you move it by like a millimeter or like an inch or a like a tenth

85
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.980
of an inch, what, a smaller than an inch, then it is going to this drug start is going to kick in.

86
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.830
So let's go ahead and let's see that for ourselves.

87
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.420
And now we can see that item number one is removed.

88
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.060
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at one more time.

89
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.740
I'm going to grab item number six.

90
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.470
And when I move it, then item number six is removed C and we cannot see it again.

91
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.400
This is the drug start event listener.

92
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.210
But there is something missing here.

93
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.720
The thing is that whenever this event happens, whenever this drugs start happens, we can see that

94
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.910
our item immediately goes away.

95
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.260
There is no time for this item to stay on top.

96
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:40.380
And we we have no way of like dragging the time that this function requires to be implemented.

97
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.890
So in order to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a sit time out.

98
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:54.400
Now, the cool thing about this time out is that even if I provide even if I provide like zero seconds,

99
00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:02.770
like zero milliseconds, this is still going to stretch the time that this function is going to run.

100
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.860
So I'm just going to put this here and in here.

101
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.610
I'm just going to provide it with zero milliseconds.

102
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.540
Now, this is the cool thing about the Satima function.

103
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.760
So now if I grab it, you can see that I can actually move it, even though the set time out is zero.

104
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.670
But this still provides us with a simple with a little bit of delay, and that is what we want.

105
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.190
But still, I just want to put it to 50 so it doesn't confuse you that much.

106
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.200
So the delay is going to be fifty millisecond.

107
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.310
Right.

108
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.250
And now it is gone.

109
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.540
So if I grab this, it has gone, gone, gone.

110
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.060
Everything is gone because we have specified the drugs start, but where is the drug?

111
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.570
And let's go ahead and specify that as well.

112
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.390
So I'm going to come down here, I'm going to grab the item and I'm going to say an event listener,

113
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:59.040
the event is going to be drag and right and we're going to run a function.

114
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.810
What does the function?

115
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.750
OK, what is that function?

116
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.210
What is the function going to do?

117
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.670
We will take a look at that.

118
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.200
So I should provide a parentheses there.

119
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.900
All right.

120
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.050
So the function is going to be again, we are going to say sit time out.

121
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:25.440
The reason for that is the same reason that we we have here and we are going to sit at 250 milliseconds.

122
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.880
We have grabbed our item and we have set display to none.

123
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.620
And now when the drag is ended, we want to see it again.

124
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.350
OK.

125
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:41.150
And right after that, we are going to call our drugged item once more, OK?

126
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:47.280
And we are going to say that it is not all right, because whenever you select an item and you want

127
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.190
to drag it, then this drug item is going to be equal to the item that the user has selected.

128
00:08:53.490 --> 00:09:02.130
But when the user drops it or when the drag event is ended, we want again reset that drug item because

129
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.580
the user might select that item or the user might select another item to drug.

130
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.050
So we have to reset the counter.

131
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.980
We have to set it to null once more.

132
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.960
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at it so we can see that we cannot move it to this container

133
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.470
is, of course, because these containers, none of the containers they have any events of for for for

134
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.970
the drug.

135
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:32.160
But the thing is now, whenever I grab it enough, if I move it and release it, it is going to come

136
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.820
back to its original state as opposed to our previous example where we grabbed it.

137
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.420
And it was like removed from this container because the display none kicked in.

138
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.780
Now the display lock has kicked in and we can still see our element or item.

139
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.080
This is going to be it for this lecture in the next election.

140
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.830
We are going to go ahead and grab the the containers inside, which we want to place in these list items.

141
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:04.670
And there are like a bunch of event listeners there, which I promise are going to be simple.

142
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.390
So see you guys then.
