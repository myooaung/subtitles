00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.240
In this election, we will be drawing lines in circles using canvas.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.240
All right, so first off, let's go ahead and let's select the elements that we will be working with.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.180
Of course, the first element that we will be selecting is going to be the canvas and I'm going to select

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.800
it using its I.D. So I'm just going to say get aliment by I.D..

6
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.360
Yeah, we haven't done this in a while now, the idea of the canvas element is drawing Dasch canvas,

7
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.260
right?

8
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.780
The next thing that I want to grab is going to be the increase button increase Beaton and I'm going

9
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.060
to do.

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.590
We're reselected this time and let's see how we can selected in the demo.

11
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.010
So the increase has an idea of increase.

12
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.540
So let's grab the idea and spot a no sign and let's put an IED here.

13
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.280
We can basically do the same thing for the decrease between.

14
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.160
And we are going to say decrease, right, decrease, the next thing that I want to grab is, well,

15
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.400
I couldn't think of any better way of like.

16
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.150
And any better idea for the name of this this size, because the idea is size, and if I go ahead and

17
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.840
if I like put the name of the variable to size, then that might be confusing for you.

18
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.500
So I came up with another name and I'm and I'm going to call it stroke, stroke, thickness a right.

19
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.260
And it is this number right here.

20
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.620
This is going to indicate the stroke thickness and it has an idea of size.

21
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.060
So document that query selector.

22
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.150
We are going to grab size.

23
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.880
Right.

24
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.890
The next thing is I want to grab the collar button and finally we are going to select the clear button.

25
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.940
So const color B10.

26
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.590
We are going to say document that.

27
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.210
I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to put it right here so the ID is going to be color.

28
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.450
And finally.

29
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.570
I'm going to grab this collar and I'm going to change it with clear.

30
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.050
I think we are good to go.

31
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.960
So now we have selected all of our e-mail elements that we want to work with in the in the damn right.

32
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.890
So we have selected this this decrease increase this number or size the color.

33
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.520
Right.

34
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.080
Of course, because this is in a format that you can use it or write.

35
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.010
This functionality is done through e-mail.

36
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.210
It has nothing to do with JavaScript.

37
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.600
But whenever we want to print this color to the brush, we are going to use JavaScript and we have our

38
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.650
clear button here.

39
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.210
All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to provide you with two resources here, right?

40
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.750
So these resources, they are first stuff.

41
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.100
We are going to go over to them.

42
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.720
And now what we are going to do is we are going to use get context method and we are going to specify

43
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.070
a 2D plane.

44
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.460
So the e-mail canvas element Dugit context method returns a drawing context on the canvas or know if

45
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.310
the context identifier is in our support or the canvas has already been set to a different context.

46
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.350
It means that whenever we want to draw something on canvas.

47
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.640
All right.

48
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.830
We need to initialize that drawing capability in JavaScript and we do that through get context.

49
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.860
So the way we do that is before giving you this, I'm just going to come down here and I'm going to

50
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.930
say const seatbacks.

51
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.710
Right.

52
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.400
And we are going to we are going to grab our canvas element or canvas variable and we are going to call

53
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.500
a get context.

54
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.459
Get context.

55
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.890
Matheran it.

56
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:27.920
All right, and we are going to set it to tudy because we want to initialize it to context for drawing

57
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.410
on the on the canvas.

58
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.200
All right.

59
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.650
And if we come here, I think it's way down below.

60
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.800
This is the canvas rendering context 2D for 2D, OK?

61
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:49.340
And what it says is the interface it part of Canvas API provides the 2D rendering context for the drawing

62
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.860
surface.

63
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:57.200
This is what we are looking for on the it provides that capability that we can draw in two dimensions.

64
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.070
It means in the Y axis and in the X axis.

65
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.420
All right.

66
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.060
That is 2D, right?

67
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.380
When it has with and height or it has with length or height and length.

68
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.180
It doesn't matter when it has two dimensions, it is 2D and whenever we specify to 2D, then we can

69
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.400
apply, we can draw on the canvas.

70
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.760
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab these two and I'm going to put her put them right here.

71
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.540
All right.

72
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.190
And I'm going to you know what?

73
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.300
I'm just going to copy the comment from here and I'm going to put it right here.

74
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.610
Now, this is the canvas get context, method and canvas rendering context 2D in case you want to study

75
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.280
more.

76
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.120
This is where you can find the the authentic documentation for this.

77
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.020
All right.

78
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.750
So this is what allows us to ensure this line is what allows us to draw on canvas.

79
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.290
Right.

80
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.400
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first off, let's go ahead and consider log what actually this

81
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.110
is what it entails.

82
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.720
This is a variable name, of course, but what does it hold?

83
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.010
Let's go ahead and let's consider to the let's look into the console and let's inspect.

84
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.450
Come to the console.

85
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.010
This is can we surrender?

86
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.170
Surrendering context, 2D.

87
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.760
And when we click on it, we have all these methods and all these properties that we can use.

88
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.350
All right, so this is this is what what allows us to write, for example, this is the stroke's style.

89
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.170
We can change the color.

90
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.120
This is the shadow color, for example.

91
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.330
This is the line with is one.

92
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.100
This is the font Felter.

93
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.350
Now, some of these we are going to use.

94
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.180
All right.

95
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.690
So we don't need to do is I'm just going to go ahead and get rid of this cancer, the log.

96
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.710
And I'm going to apply I'm going to declare some variables.

97
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.370
All right.

98
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:03.440
And these these variables, they're going to hold the initial values for our drawing, for our canvas,

99
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.270
for drawing.

100
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.650
Right.

101
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.350
So initially, what I want is the size, the size of the stroke.

102
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.730
I want it to be 10 y ten because we have specified that in the in the medium.

103
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.020
So whenever you say ten there, let's get rid of this.

104
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.330
Now, this is 10.

105
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.520
We wanted to start from ten, if you specified initially to let's say 30.

106
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:32.390
And whenever you click on the plus, it is not going to be eleven, it's going to be thirty one, which

107
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.250
is not accurate.

108
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.590
Right.

109
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.320
So this is our size at first.

110
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.970
The size the size is going to hold in the number ten, then we are going to add another.

111
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.100
We are going to create another variable and that is is pressed initially.

112
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.360
It should be false.

113
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:58.700
The reason that it is false is whenever you're not pressing the left key and when you're hovering over

114
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.390
this canvas, we do not want to draw anything.

115
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.630
So let me just go ahead and open up the final project right here.

116
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.370
So this is I'm just going to put it here and let's go ahead and close these two.

117
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.080
So this is the final project.

118
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:19.100
Whenever I'm when I hover on the canvas, can you you guys can see that we do not draw anything.

119
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.610
But when I click and hold and drag.

120
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.690
Then we're driving.

121
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:30.620
All right, so this is why that is pressed initially is going to be false.

122
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:39.429
All right, so the next thing that I want to create here is the color, so, oops, what is that?

123
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:48.480
So initially I want the color to be black, so I'm going to put it inside and this is going to be strengthened.

124
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.690
Said quotes and the X coordinates is going to be undefined.

125
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:55.830
All right.

126
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.190
And the Y cornice is also going to be undefined because the user has not clicked.

127
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.040
So we actually we do not know where the user is going to click.

128
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:12.990
And when we know that we are going to start drawing from the exact spot that the user has started,

129
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.320
started clicking and holding.

130
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:22.530
So whenever the user clicks here, we do not want to start drawing on the upper left corner.

131
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.390
All right.

132
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.490
So we want to start drawing wherever the user has clicked.

133
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.880
But initially, the user has not clicked anywhere.

134
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.060
That's why we do not know the value for this.

135
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:33.960
Right.

136
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.900
So this is going to be it for this lecture.

137
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:43.650
In the next lecture, we will be going over some steps and then we will be actually creating or drawing

138
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.370
circles and drawing lines on the canvas.

139
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.410
See you guys in the next lecture.
