1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,910
Hi, everyone, in this that we are going to pick up where we left off in regard of implementing the

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,050
edit and the delete functionalities for the entries.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:20,690
OK, so we know what the idea is going to be for that target that we click on it.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,150
I don't need to really console it because at this point you are very familiar with that.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:36,260
OK, so we need all this, we have all that now let's create our investment so we set if target but

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,030
we know Target.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,980
Putin has a class, OK, because we selected the class right here and there are two classes because

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,930
there isn't any third class.

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:53,830
If there is a third class, this function is going to return and it is not going to run anything.

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,900
The function is going to return.

11
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,880
We just we are just interested for the classes of the icons, the icons.

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,239
There are two icons, hence two classes.

13
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:14,180
So if the target button, the icon that we have clicked on has you know what I'm just going to say one

14
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,650
equal to if the target button is equal to it icon.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:27,030
IT icon for which the value is this, we have just stored it like a better practice.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,290
If it is the Tikhon, what do we want to do?

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,630
We want to call the Idit entry function.

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,730
And whenever we call the edit entry function, we want to target that.

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,820
We want to grab the target ID because if I have like let's say, a salary of 1000 inside the income

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,140
and let's say I have a project 500, whenever I want to edit the salary, I should be able to that the

21
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,740
salary.

22
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,300
When I click on the edit icon for the salary, I should not be able to edit the project, I should add,

23
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,900
at that specific target idea that I have clicked on, OK?

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,750
That's why we have pastored there.

25
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,470
So this is our first scenario.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
What is the other one so elusive?

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,160
What if the target button target Beaton is equal to delete icon?

28
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:33,390
So if it is the delete icon, we want to run the delete entry function and again, we will pass in the

29
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:40,830
target idea because again, I have a salary and I have a project in the income tracker.

30
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,230
So when I click on the salary, I should not delete the project.

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,540
Right.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,770
I should delete the salary.

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,600
That's how we can track the ID and we are done with this event listener.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,160
So now let's dive in and let's create the edit entry and delete entry functions.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,460
So first off, I'm going to create the delete entry function, which is because this is easier than

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,150
the other one.

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,250
So let's create the function, delete delete entry.

38
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,680
OK, so we are going to pass in as the parameter target ID.

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,870
So what is the target?

40
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,700
We need to feed this function with a target ID, whereas the target ID going to come from we know where

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,640
is it going to come from from here, but where is it going to come from inside this function?

42
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,690
It is going to come from our entry list because when I when I completed, I'm going to tell you why

43
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,050
we are going to call our splice method, which we have talked about.

44
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:55,020
So the splice method either removes or replaces or adds to an item, item to array.

45
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,560
So that's what the splice method does.

46
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,720
So in this case, we wanted to remove.

47
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,360
So we are going to pass in the target ID.

48
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,900
What is the idea that we have clicked on and we want to remove one item of that array?

49
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,200
Because when I click on the salary salaries, what item and when I click it, I want to remove that

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,880
specific one item.

51
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,180
I do not want to remove the project as well with the salary.

52
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,580
In that case, I should provide two.

53
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,800
If I if you want to remove two items with one, click on the trash.

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,940
You just passed two.

55
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,930
But that is not how things work in the budget and in the budget.

56
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:41,160
And when you click on that one icon, that one ally should be deleted and the target ID from for that

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,070
ally is going to be passed from here.

58
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,350
We know what the target ID is.

59
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,850
It is the one that we have clicked on and we pass it right here.

60
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,930
So let's say the item has a target idea of zero.

61
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,830
When we pass the zero here, it means it is the first item inside that array.

62
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,680
And we want to this is the delete count.

63
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,240
The lead count is one.

64
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,520
So we want to delete the first item.

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,210
By one count, it means we only want to delete one item and then we want to update our UI.

66
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,340
Don't forget the parentheses this time.

67
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:29,680
All right, that was very, very energizing, so they delete entry is completed, completed its go ahead

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,480
and it's tested out in here.

69
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,930
So I'm just going to click on it and it says the editor is not defined.

70
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,580
So let's go ahead and define that.

71
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,200
So we are going to define the edit entry.

72
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,210
So we are going to say function.

73
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,570
No, no, no, no, no, we're going to edit entry function.

74
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,260
So

75
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,990
function edit entry.

76
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:07,540
What do we want to pass in as the parameter is the target idea based on the idea we delete it, we get

77
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,100
rid of it.

78
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,350
So let's go ahead and let's do a bunch of console logs.

79
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,440
So I'm going to grab your entry list at this point.

80
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,760
What is the entry list?

81
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,690
Let's go ahead and let's take a look at it.

82
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,030
So if I click on this edit, we can see our interest inside the entry list.

83
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,640
We have two specific objects.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
The first one has an idea of zero.

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
The second one has an idea of one.

86
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,120
So what it is that I've clicked on, let's go ahead and let's find out.

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
And in here I am going to pass in the Target ID.

88
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,830
So the target ID should tell me what is what it is that I've clicked on.

89
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,980
So we are inside the expense and I click on this, we can see that we have clicked on the expense.

90
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,880
You can see this is the rent rent two and three from here.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,910
So now we know what we have clicked on.

92
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,810
All right.

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,790
What do we want to do with that?

94
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,500
We know what we have clicked on.

95
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,190
What do we want to do with that whenever we click on the edit icon?

96
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:19,330
So when we click on the edit icon, we want to edit the title and the amount not set so that and you

97
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:19,840
know what?

98
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm just going to keep it there and replicated here.

99
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,450
Dot image

100
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,680
and come on, buddy.

101
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,570
So if I click on this we should get the amount two, one, three.

102
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,770
And this is blue.

103
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,010
It means it's a number we don't need to do.

104
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,760
Jason, sorry, pass integer anymore.

105
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,570
So we need to grab the amount and we need to grab the title.

106
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,670
So that title.

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,110
So if I click on this salary and the amount is thirteen 64.

108
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,220
All right, so we need we have successfully selected these.

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,460
Why is that the reason that we have selected these as we are going to store these values?

110
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,880
So we are going to say let's target Type B equal to what is the type?

111
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,710
So the type you know what?

112
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,410
I'm going to create another console as well.

113
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,270
I might as well do.

114
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,600
Where is our cursor?

115
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh, it's right here.

116
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,570
So let's see what is the type when I click on it.

117
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,450
So for this we should get income.

118
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,250
For this, we should get expense.

119
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,080
Perfect.

120
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,330
So now we are going to store all these console logs inside variables.

121
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,460
So the target type is going to be this one.

122
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:52,740
And then we have a target amount amount, the target amount is going is going to be this whatever is

123
00:08:52,740 --> 00:09:00,670
be that the the expense or the income, I am running out of fuel.

124
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,570
So target title should be the title that we have here.

125
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,880
So entry dot v.

126
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,810
So this is going to give us our target.

127
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:20,520
So to the most important part, if if the target type.

128
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,620
Equals income.

129
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,700
What do we want to do?

130
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:33,620
We want to grab the income amount we're raised the income amount, so income amount, come on.

131
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:40,740
But we want to grab the income amount, income amounts, value, and we want to sell it to our target

132
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,210
amount.

133
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,890
So target amount is the amount that we just passed.

134
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,720
And there you just saw it.

135
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:54,480
And because whenever we want to edit an entry, basically we want to edit the amount and we want to

136
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,110
edit the title because that's the only two information that we have inside these inputs.

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,430
We don't we cannot edit anything else.

138
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,750
We cannot edit the type.

139
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,490
We have specified the type.

140
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:13,470
We just edit the amount and the title title that value.

141
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,070
So the value should be equal to target title.

142
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,750
Very, very simple.

143
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,510
So if the target type is income, do this else.

144
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:36,310
The target type is equal to expense, then do what they can, then do exactly the same thing, grab

145
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,720
the expense amount, amount's value and set it to target amount.

146
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:49,060
Now we set it to target Taman because target amount, as you just saw, could be the income amount or

147
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,010
could be the expense amount.

148
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,360
So this is targeted.

149
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,890
Doesn't matter what the says, as long as this is correct here.

150
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,150
And the title expense title value should be target title.

151
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,730
Do we have anything else here?

152
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,660
No, but yes, one more thing, we want to delete our entry.

153
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,710
Why delete our entry?

154
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,150
Everything is correct.

155
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,320
The application is done.

156
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:26,120
So whenever I click on the edit, when I click on it, you can see that the entry has been deleted.

157
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,620
Oh, gosh, where is the entry?

158
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,330
The entry is right here.

159
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:39,800
And if I add it to 2004 and now you can see it is 2004 if I come here and if I said rent is very, very

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:49,160
expensive, 1000 dollars, if I click on the edit at the end, we want to remove that I that item,

161
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:58,810
that entry, because we want to update it with another one like one oh one enter and this is it.

162
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,610
So let's go ahead.

163
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,850
We don't see any errors.

164
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,150
I'm just going to leave it right here in case there are any errors.

165
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,360
Let's delete yeb delete.

166
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,690
Yep.

167
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,230
Delete.

168
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,310
Everything is updated.

169
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,590
So oops.

170
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,520
What is this.

171
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's reload the page.

172
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,240
Oops.

173
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,400
So let's say salary is very good.

174
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Fifteen hundred let's add.

175
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,110
So no no no no no.

176
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,920
Salary is three thousand.

177
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Just added it.

178
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,430
Very good expenses.

179
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,660
A lot of expenses.

180
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,760
Rent is like crazy.

181
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,780
150.

182
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,180
No no no no no.

183
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,620
Rent is actually 550.

184
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,520
Perfect.

185
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,090
It works.

186
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,620
Woops, what was that when I clicked on it, it said five fifty.

187
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,720
Yeah, so let's delete it.

188
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,130
Excuse me.

189
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,530
Let's try one more time.

190
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,250
It is that let's say 1500.

191
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,210
Yipes.

192
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,260
It is ipse.

193
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,610
It is deleted.

194
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,110
Everything is there.

195
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,480
And where is the income.

196
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,960
Did we delete the income.

197
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,820
12.

198
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,090
Reload the page.

199
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,330
OK, everything is right here, 12 is very insignificant to.

200
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,050
What is happening here, what is happening?

201
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,990
OK, so let's go ahead, do it one more time project.

202
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:43,730
Project 1000, that's it, and let's add the expense, rent 500, that's added.

203
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:52,650
So if I click on this, everything is right here, this ad 5000, it is 5000.

204
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,830
Everything is in the all I can delete it from the all everything is here.

205
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,250
So now nothing is here.

206
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,670
Right.

207
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,140
And our local.

208
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,990
Why doesn't it call the clear?

209
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,010
Inputs, what is happening with the clear inputs?

210
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:19,490
Hmm, OK, this is delete entry oh, whoops, we should say targeted as well.

211
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,780
That's why it was like a bit buggy there.

212
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,320
So let's go ahead and let's say one more time.

213
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,650
I should be I should make sure that this is working properly.

214
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,990
So twelve hundred, let's admit it to like twenty thousand.

215
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm very rich getting rent.

216
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,840
Well I couldn't be rent rich because French because they pay nineteen thousand of that for rent.

217
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,060
So if I delete both of them from here.

218
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,670
It is still here.

219
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,260
Did I click on the edit, it is still here.

220
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,790
Oh, right, so what is going on here?

221
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:13,760
So we say update UI, we update the UI by one, we grab the target ID pass and the target ID, Target

222
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:21,980
ID, Edad ID if type is income, we want the amount value target amount, income title, target title

223
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:33,380
income target type is expense expense amount value target amount title target title home if target button

224
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,580
is added to icon.

225
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,150
Run the data entry, otherwise run the delete entry if target beats.

226
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,810
If Target Beacon is that.

227
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,550
It attack on the daily Tikhon target button.

228
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,980
Where is the entry?

229
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,680
The entry.

230
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:14,140
And that parent out, so if I come here into this target IED to that target, specifically that IED,

231
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,430
I mean, shouldn't be seeing that here.

232
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,410
So let's let's see if we can see them here.

233
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,900
So if I delete them from there, I can't see them here.

234
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:34,960
So, you know, in the final application, let's say project twelve hundred, let's edit it to 1500,

235
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:43,860
add an expensive front like one 20, that's Editta to 150.

236
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:51,670
And now if I remove it from here and from here, it is not here, it is not here and it is not here.

237
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,230
So it should be the same for this one as well.

238
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,750
So project that say 1500 Editta to 2500.

239
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:12,030
And let's add expensive rent, 750, oh, no, that's added to do that.

240
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,569
Let's click on this and click on this.

241
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,740
Oh see, everything is cool because we added the triple equality.

242
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,680
This is why I always tell you guys use the triple equality.

243
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,069
Always.

244
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,280
Always.

245
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,250
All right.

246
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,800
So I think I think our application is done.

247
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,320
We can't afford to look.

248
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,630
So now nothing should be inside the local.

249
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,330
Of course, we can delete the entries from here as well.

250
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,450
Delete them from there.

251
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,760
It is going to be deleted from the all.

252
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,450
So if I added, if I deleted from here, the URL is going to be updated accordingly.

253
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:02,680
So now if I go into my local storage, into application, local service, we see and only we can see

254
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,750
there is like this empty array.

255
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:13,900
And we can see that in here as well, that if I go ahead and if I cancel our entry list, entry list

256
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,600
is this should be an interior as well.

257
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,140
And let's wait for it.

258
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,090
Come on.

259
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:28,560
OK, so this is an empty array as well, length zero, this is it for this project.

260
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,740
I'm super, super excited that you have come this far and I'm really happy for you.

261
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:41,910
Good luck on your journey to the end of this course, because there is a lot like like literally a ton.

262
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,780
Not literally.

263
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,540
They don't teach us grammar here.

264
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:52,140
So my back there is a lot there is a lot still remaining.

265
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,490
But I really commend you on your perseverance and hard work.

266
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:02,790
You are a wonderful person for doing all this for you because you want a better life.

267
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:10,890
You want like more more money or whatever it is, you're going to get it, I'm sure, and keep working

268
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,310
hard.

269
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,590
You're going to achieve all the milestones.

270
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,790
You're going to, you know, like the cliche, sky's the limit.

271
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,170
See you guys in the next chapter.
