00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.100
In this lecture, we will draw the score and handle game over.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.890
All right, so the score is going to be drawn within the can using the canvas, right?

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:27.250
So what I would like to do is so the score has to be drawn like seven times as sick as well.

5
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.670
Right.

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.540
So what we would want to do here as we would want to call that function within the play game and let's

7
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.350
go ahead and let's actually create it.

8
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.240
So on top of the clear screen, I'm going to say function, draw, score and let's copy the comment,

9
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.010
put it on top of the function and change it to draw score.

10
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.840
All right, OK, so draw score.

11
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.530
So for the for the score, we just have simple text for text, we need we need to define the texts color,

12
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.620
the font size and the font family along with whatever, along with whatever it is, the whatever is

13
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.090
the text position.

14
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.520
Right, so the texts, text and the texts position, so we are going to say Conex darte Phil's title

15
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:40.010
for text color, let's just put it to white context, dot font within here we are going to specify 15

16
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.610
pixels sans serif.

17
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.600
I mean, who doesn't like sans serif?

18
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.960
And we are going to say filled text.

19
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.130
What is going to be the text now within here we have it.

20
00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.230
I'm going to provide in template literal and we're going to say score and then the score is whatever

21
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.580
we incremented by.

22
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.450
Right.

23
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.680
So that is going to be the score.

24
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.920
The position is going to be 20 in the X, 20 in the Y.

25
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.660
Let's save that.

26
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.090
That's unexpected.

27
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.100
What is unexpected.

28
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.530
Oh, so this is oh, we should pass on the score here as well, so let's save that.

29
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.410
Let's come here so we can see that it is working there.

30
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:35.130
But we need to increase the score, right, whenever the snake eats the the snack.

31
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.020
So where is the collision detection for the snack snack solidity within.

32
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.460
Here we are.

33
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.880
Whenever the snake eats one of the snacks, we are going to grab the snake's tail length and increment

34
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.510
it by one.

35
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.420
We are going to grab the score incremented by one.

36
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.920
And while we are here, we are going to grab our speed.

37
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.040
And I'm sorry that I've said that, but we are going to increment the speed by one each time, not zero

38
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.550
point one.

39
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.430
We are going to incremented by one.

40
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.670
We are here.

41
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.970
Right.

42
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.110
So let's save this.

43
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.260
Let's actually test it so you can see that the score is to the length is bigger.

44
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.170
There we go, and the speed is being increased.

45
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.460
Definitely really fast.

46
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.590
All righty.

47
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.750
Perfect.

48
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.910
We don't have any collision detection for the war, which we are going to set up.

49
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.380
Next up, let's go ahead and let's go.

50
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.680
Excuse me, let's handle Gameover as well.

51
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.800
So actually, whenever the game is over, what it is that we want to do, we want the screen to be frozen

52
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.450
at that specific time.

53
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.320
The game is over.

54
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.400
So you can see right here, you know, where you've gone wrong.

55
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.560
You know where the snake hits the border.

56
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.610
You know where the SWAT, the score is the current score.

57
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.980
You know, where the current position of the snake is.

58
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.000
So right at that position, we want to pause everything.

59
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.760
And until the user refresh the page, the user is not going to be able to do anything.

60
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.300
So except for keeping the position, changing the snake position, except for that specific position

61
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.290
that the snake is going to have currently we are not going to do anything.

62
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.760
So I'm just going to say handling game over.

63
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.560
Except for that, we will not be running anything out, so we are just going to return from this.

64
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.150
First off, let's say a result equals game over function.

65
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.920
If it is true, if the result is true, just go ahead and return from this function.

66
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.900
Perfect.

67
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.730
Now, we need to create this game over function as well.

68
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.140
Right.

69
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.760
So why don't we go ahead and actually create it?

70
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:12.060
OK, so this is going to be game over function within this, we are going to check for collision detection

71
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.360
as well.

72
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.470
So initially, the game is not going to be over.

73
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.250
So first off, let's create the function game over.

74
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.870
Initially, it is not going to be zero, so game over is going to be false.

75
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:35.550
Right, and then I'm going to check for velocities are zero, it means that the game has not started

76
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.210
yet, right?

77
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.270
And if it is not started, how could it be like how could it be game to game over?

78
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:56.490
So we are going to say if the X velocity equals zero and the Y velocity equals zero, then return.

79
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.700
False.

80
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.860
Perfect.

81
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.170
That is our first condition.

82
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.930
Now, then after that, we are going to check for.

83
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.390
Check for Wall Collision.

84
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.840
So why do I keep forgetting the spaces?

85
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:20.390
And keep putting him in the wrong places, so checking for wall collision, I'm just going to four wall

86
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.950
colation.

87
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.140
Perfect.

88
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.760
So we are going to say f the snake's head position is less than zero.

89
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.960
It means that it has hit the left wall.

90
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.360
Right.

91
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.100
We are going to say that game over, game over is true.

92
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.830
Now we are going to do a bunch of lifts.

93
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.870
So let's copy this.

94
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:57.500
Let's say ALS, ALS, the ALS, if the game sorry, the snake's heads exposition because our title count

95
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.960
equals our tile count, it means that it has had the other position.

96
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.590
Then we are going to say game over is true as well.

97
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.640
Now let's copy this down below.

98
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:17.410
If the snake's heads y position equals zero, it means that the game is over.

99
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.150
And also if the snake's.

100
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:30.940
Y y position is equal to the tile count, it has also hit a wall, right?

101
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:38.690
We are going to say Gameover is true now doing this, all of that.

102
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.590
This is not really good practice.

103
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.000
I'm going to show you a better way.

104
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.590
But first off, we need to check for the.

105
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:54.260
Snake body collision as well, right after we are done with the game, I'm going to show you another

106
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.130
way that you can basically do this on like two lines of code instead of all this.

107
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.530
All right.

108
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.570
So we are going to first off, let's go ahead and iterate over the snake's body.

109
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.020
So we're going to for let equals zero.

110
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:19.910
I goes all the way to snake bodies that length and I is incremented by one each time.

111
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:31.260
Let's grab the part so we're going to sell that part is equal to the snake's bodies, eye each iteration,

112
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:46.500
and then if the part that X is equal to the snake's heads exposition and part that Y is equal to the

113
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.220
snake's.

114
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:54.150
Hard to y is equal to the snake's head y position.

115
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.590
What do we want to do?

116
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:04.320
We want to say game over is true and we want to break from the iteration.

117
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:05.890
Perfect.

118
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.150
Now, what happens when game over is true, if game over is true, what do we want to do?

119
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.520
We have we have said a lot of game over.

120
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.940
True.

121
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.940
But what if it is true?

122
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.530
We need to handle that situation as well.

123
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:20.890
Right.

124
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:29.510
So if Gameover is true, we want to print a text to the screen and the text is going to have a false

125
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:36.300
title, which is going to be what the text is going to have some text properties.

126
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.720
So we are going to say that font, it is going to be 50 pixels.

127
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:54.730
Fifty pixels and also the family is sans serif and the text is going to have a position, so it's going

128
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.950
to be that filled text.

129
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.500
What is the text itself?

130
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:04.270
It is going to be game over like in block letters.

131
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.190
So game over.

132
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:15.720
And the canvas elements with half of the width is going to be the exposition and the half of the height

133
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.560
is going to be the wife position directly in the center.

134
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.030
Right.

135
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.050
Now, let's go ahead and let's actually do something with this.

136
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.460
So let's save that and let's check what we have done a lot of stuff, let's go ahead and let's check

137
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.570
it.

138
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.290
So it is moving right through the wall.

139
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:48.220
And why is that shouldn't move right through the wall if snakes if the snakes head position game over

140
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.730
is true, if game over is true.

141
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.240
Have we done Gameover?

142
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.660
True.

143
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.800
Perfectly fine.

144
00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:02.820
We have called the function called the function is there, oh, we need to actually return something,

145
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.480
we need to return something.

146
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.930
So this boolean actually works, this right here, this result.

147
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.810
And we need to return the state of the game over whatever state that is.

148
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.280
Be that true or false?

149
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.690
So now let's try this one more time.

150
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.120
Boom.

151
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:27.220
It says, game over, but you can see that the height of this game over is almost fine, but the width

152
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.420
is a bit a bit off.

153
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.260
So let's go ahead and fix that.

154
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.840
I'm going to say divided by eight.

155
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.620
Just bring it to the left a little.

156
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:45.220
There we go, that's fine, so left game over top is not game over.

157
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.420
Why is it coming short?

158
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.010
It shouldn't come short.

159
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.180
So it's elusive snakes.

160
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.380
It is less than I think it is less than one.

161
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.830
It is less than the why the zero.

162
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.190
Then we are going to say like game over.

163
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.610
Perfect.

164
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.800
Let's do right.

165
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:08.610
Perfect.

166
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.720
Let's do left.

167
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.680
Perfect.

168
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.790
That's the bottom.

169
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.650
So now let's grab the snack increased.

170
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:25.540
Hit it, game over and perfect, I think we have completed that two things are remaining.

171
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.000
One, that cleaning up the code that I told you that I'm going to show you.

172
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.290
But first, let's elongate the snake so we can head the body.

173
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.840
There we go.

174
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.240
When you had the body, I was going to say game over.

175
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.540
Now, first off, what I would like to do is I would like to clean this code up.

176
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.950
So instead of doing that, we can just say all of that with just one line of code.

177
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:06.240
So we are going to say if this condition is true or.

178
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.360
This condition is.

179
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:18.400
So the reason that this works is because we have four walls, only one of them can be true at a time.

180
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.280
No two of them can be two at the same time.

181
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:26.830
That's why this is going to work and we are going to say if this condition is true.

182
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.450
So let's parsad there and finally, if this condition is.

183
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:43.540
If any of this is true, any one of these is true, we just want to say that the GAMEOVER is equal to

184
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:43.930
true.

185
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.070
So you can see that it did rearrange it.

186
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.920
So headache's that this and that, let's go ahead.

187
00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.120
It was technically one line of code, but the prettier does its magic anyway.

188
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.130
So in here, let's go ahead and check that.

189
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.100
I think that is better readable than what we had before and that code looks more professional.

190
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:11.870
There we go.

191
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.920
So the only thing remaining here is for us to actually go ahead and apply the sound effect.

192
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.180
So for applying the sound effects, let's go on top of this.

193
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:29.740
And in here, I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to say it sneck.

194
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:39.380
That's instantiate a new audio object, and in here we are just going to grab grab the audio with the

195
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.360
source, which is WHV.

196
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.050
And if you look in here, there is the sound track there.

197
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:54.530
When do we want this to be played, whenever they the snack collegiately happens, so in here we are

198
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.840
going to call our eat snack and we are going to say that play.

199
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.490
It is increased the volume.

200
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.530
Let's now play for real.

201
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.500
There we go.

202
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.880
Cheetos, like the snake is eating Cheetos.

203
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.750
Very nice, right?

204
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.040
So that's it for this game.

205
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.370
I had my tail, I didn't hit my toe, the snake hit its body.

206
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.250
So that's going to be it for this project.

207
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.630
I'm sure you learned some some new things.

208
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:43.060
And the most important thing was you learned another way of actually doing that game loop.

209
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:52.040
That's what the entire ideology behind this game is that how you can leverage the game loop to create

210
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.630
these kind of games like it?

211
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.400
And I hope you have learned something valuable.

212
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.190
And that's it for this lecture and for this chapter.

213
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.750
See you guys in the next one.
