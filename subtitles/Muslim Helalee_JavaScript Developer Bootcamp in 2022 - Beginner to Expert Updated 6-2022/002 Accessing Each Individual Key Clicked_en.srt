00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,910
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to make this keyboard dynamic.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,120
All right, so first things first, we need to grab what we need from our e-mail, so I'm going to say

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,960
CONSED.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,280
I can never spell this right and we are going to say containers container's so first off, we are going

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,830
to grab our key containers.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,930
Let's capitalize the C to follow the camel case naming convention.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,250
And now we are going to select document that query selector.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,690
But because we have more than one key container, we are going to say document that key query selector

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,310
all and we are going to grab our keys from here.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,640
So basically we are selecting these diffs inside of which we have our inputs.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,200
All right.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,640
And the next thing that I want to select is going to be text area, and we are going to say document

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:12,110
that query selector and now the text area is inside the div of display and it is the text.

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,680
Text area, save it.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,650
All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to do some console logs for for the key containers.

16
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,460
I just want to show you guys some things.

17
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,250
Right.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,050
Which are really important to understanding how to be able to create this keyboard and how to make it

19
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,660
dynamic.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:33,940
All right.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,770
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead.

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,670
I'm going to console the lock, the key container's let's save it.

23
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,530
And in here we see you.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,840
You guys can see that we get a necklace.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,780
And this Notley's looks like an array.

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,370
And the good thing about this is we can use arrays, properties and methods on this Nobelist, even

27
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,150
though it is a no.

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,970
This it looks like an array and we have indices.

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,920
So we have difficulty zero index index number one.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,490
Number two.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,310
And this spacebar is going to be the index number three.

32
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,140
And whenever we click on these arrows, it is going to show us everything there is.

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,130
All right.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,380
And now let's let's go ahead and let's find out, I don't know, we can see the inner HTML and text,

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,700
we can see the.

36
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,320
All right.

37
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,310
Let's go over it.

38
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,250
See, we can see the data set.

39
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,810
We can see the first child.

40
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,760
We can see the first element.

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,780
Right, and we can see the children, so if I click on these children, we are going to see every individual

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,330
input.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,450
So this is how we can access every individual input.

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,900
That's why we have selected the parent, because when we do kids, when we do key containers that children,

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,960
we are going to be able we are going to be able to access all these keys, all these individual keys

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,010
that you guys can see here.

47
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,880
All right.

48
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,340
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to comment that one out and coming this one.

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,330
All right.

50
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,030
And I'm going to say, let's see, let's grab the child, which has the index of zero.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Let's save it.

52
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,510
And now we get this first row of keys.

53
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,820
And inside there we have all our kids.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,210
I'm going to comment that one outcome in this one.

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,550
And now let's grab all the children.

56
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,070
Let's save it.

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:33,030
And in here, we can see that if we have grabbed all the inputs and this is an HDMI collection.

58
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,670
All right, and this system of collection is again surrounded by brackets, meaning it behaves like

59
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,000
an object and we can use object, it behaves like an array, and we can use an array of properties and

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,010
methods on this.

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,700
Right.

62
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,640
I just wanted to show you how this works because this idea is crucial to creating this.

63
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,820
So now we are going to create our first and last event listener and we are going to add event listener

64
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,380
containers that basically we are not going to do out of and listeners here because we have four sets

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,620
of.

66
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,670
Keys, so this is the first set, second set, third set forth.

67
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,130
So if we do keep containers out of the listener, it is going to add to the first set, but we want

68
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,060
to loop over them.

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,190
So we are going to use our foreach loop and we are going to add a function.

70
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,100
And the function is going to contain the key, which is the event, which is the loop variable.

71
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,790
Right.

72
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:42,410
And each time this loop runs, we are going to grab our key containers and we are going to add add an

73
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:50,000
event center so that kikkan we are going to grab our key, of course, not key containers because key

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,960
is the loop variable and key is actually something that is being looped over and over and over again.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,780
All right.

76
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,150
So what is it that we are listening for?

77
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,650
Of course it's a click.

78
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:12,810
And in here, I want to log I want to pass in as a parameter the e the event object itself, because

79
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,720
I just want to log it and I want to show you guys, basically the process is a bit like this, but I

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,570
want to show you guys something, OK?

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,890
And we are going to go step by step because I want you guys to really understand.

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,030
So I'm going to say cancel that log.

83
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,410
First off, let's log cancel that log.

84
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,930
First off, let's go ahead and log the event object.

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,010
So whenever we press a key, we are going to say log is not defined.

86
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,120
OK, what is this?

87
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,730
Just say this is a key and we are going to see that it says it's a mouse event.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,890
All right.

89
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,390
So if I come down here, what I want to do here is in this for each loop.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:01,460
What I want to do is whenever I click the Z key, I want to be able to print to the screen the Z letter.

91
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,330
So I want to find the path to this letter.

92
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,220
So let's go ahead and let's dive inside this path.

93
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,240
OK.

94
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,530
And from inside this path, we are going to go to this input.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,210
And from the input, we are going to go to the let's go and let's find the value.

96
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,240
Let's go to V.

97
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,100
What is the value of that key?

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,330
So is it down here?

99
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,390
So the value is, as you guys can see, it is.

100
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,160
So this is this is actually what we want to grab.

101
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,960
So if I click on the X now, let's see left, let's click on the V.

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,500
And if we come here inside the path from the path, if we go inside the input because the rest of them

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,210
are not the input, this is the input.

104
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,710
Let's go inside the input and let's take a look at the value.

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,420
So we just pressed was it the C?

106
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,560
Where is the value?

107
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,030
It was the V sorry, so we just pressed the V and we get the V right here, right.

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,470
So this is how it works.

109
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:08,080
First off, I just cancel the E, then I'm going to cancel the path and I'm going to say that path because

110
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,040
this is a prop..

111
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,350
And when I click on it, we are going to get the path to this input.

112
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,230
All right.

113
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,790
I'm going to come that one out.

114
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,670
And from this input, I want to grab the index of zero because this is an array.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
I can just write zero and I can save it.

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,150
When I click on it, we get that input.

117
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:35,350
So you guys can see this is how we can move on and how we can grab these individual keys that are being

118
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,800
clicked.

119
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,340
And from there, what do I want to grab?

120
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,700
I want to grab this value.

121
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,270
Right.

122
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,900
So I'm going to come that one out, coming in and in here.

123
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,500
I'm going to save.

124
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:55,810
So whenever I cook, I cook the Z key, we get Z, so X, C, F, D, so now we have successfully selected

125
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,040
or accessed each individual key.

126
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,710
The only thing remaining is just just printed on the screen that that's the only thing remaining.

127
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,190
But first things first.

128
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,650
Whenever we click anywhere else you guys can see, we get undefined.

129
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,700
So if you click on the queue, you're going to get.

130
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,940
Q But if it click like besides the Q like on the right of the queue, you're going to get undefined.

131
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,610
We do not want to get that right.

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:30,970
So before going there and before applying an F statement to control the flow of the flow of the logic

133
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,679
of this program, what I want to do is I want to cut this video right here.

134
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,830
And in the next lecture, we are going to continue creating this keyboard.

135
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,679
See you guys in the next one.
