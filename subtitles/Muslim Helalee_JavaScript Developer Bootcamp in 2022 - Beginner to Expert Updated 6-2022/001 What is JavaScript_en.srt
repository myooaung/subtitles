1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,830
What is JavaScript now before answering this question?

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,270
I would like to say that.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:13,990
This is going to be our very first lecture of this course, and I do not want to bore you with, like

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:20,650
a lot of theories, so I want you to get started as fast as possible.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,810
So I'm going to keep this lecture short.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,280
And by the end of this course, you will have like a perfect idea of what JavaScript is and you're going

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:38,580
to have a perfect set of skills that are going to allow you to write JavaScript cleanly and efficiently.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,150
Right.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,760
So JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages of all time.

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:56,230
JavaScript can be used to write and create web applications there they are the kind of websites that

11
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,590
you are interacting on on a daily basis, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube.

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,470
Right.

13
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,980
JavaScript is also used to create server side applications.

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,480
Right.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,100
Another fun application of JavaScript is to develop games, which I've also included in this course,

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,050
and they're going to be a lot of projects and you're going to master game development with JavaScript

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,550
as well.

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,340
JavaScript nowadays has unlimited potential and unlimited applications.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,170
JavaScript can be used to create native mobile applications for Android and iOS.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:46,890
Another cool application of JavaScript is to code robots to think and to do something.

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,040
That's why in some of our games I have included A.I. algorithms.

22
00:01:53,370 --> 00:02:00,480
By the end of this course, you will also be able to write AI algorithms to train and to create an AI

23
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,750
for some of the games that we create in this course.

24
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,850
That is also a cool part of what JavaScript is.

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:15,240
And finally, I just want to say that JavaScript has a lot of applications and it is way beyond the

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,290
scope of any one single course to cover all of them.

27
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,290
So what we would like to do, what I would like to do throughout this course, is to give you the necessary

28
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,990
skills to not only create Web applications, but also server side applications, but also create A.I.

29
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:42,790
algorithms and create APIs from scratch and also the skills to master mobile development as well.

30
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,040
So without further ado, let's start this amazing journey and let's get coding.
