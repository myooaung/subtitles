00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.200
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.660
In this lecture, we are going to convert our currency.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.660
All right, so we are done with this part and I'm going to leave it like this, you know what?

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.790
I'm just going to comment it out.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.050
I'm not going to leave it like that.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
And what I want to do is I want to create a comment here.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.870
And that's basically just going to be like dashers or hyphenates or.

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.010
Like lines, right, and I want to do the same thing here, because we are going to have some code on

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.240
top of this function, so it shouldn't get confusing for you.

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.460
So now what I want to do is we are going to grab our function and we want to perform that actual currency

11
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.770
conversion like 1000 aph and to 1000 to USD.

12
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.820
How much we are going to earn.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.540
Right.

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.130
Because money is good, right?

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.090
Is it.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.500
No, of course not.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.640
So we are going to say what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a function and this function.

18
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.860
What is this going to do?

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.400
The function inside this function, we are going to convert our currency.

20
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.910
So I'm just going to call it convert currency.

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.590
Now, what are the parameters, what do you think the parameters are, because inside this function

22
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.290
is when where we call the circuit exchange.

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.300
So these two parameters are going to come right in, that's for sure.

24
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.250
And the next one is going to be our amount or our I could say X.

25
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.860
Change exchange amount is better right now.

26
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.870
Let's call this function first and let's store it inside a variable so we have our CONSED, let's call

27
00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.220
it exchange rate, OK, so it's the same as this one.

28
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.170
I'm just going to call it.

29
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.680
Right.

30
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.190
Or I'm going to call it a mount exchange rate and mount exchange rate and let's call that function so

31
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.460
it is get exchange rates.

32
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.610
What are the two parameters that are the two arguments for that?

33
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.150
It's going to be these two, right.

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.760
And now you can see there is something wrong with this line of code.

35
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.560
And what is that?

36
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.460
This is going to be a promise.

37
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
And when this is a promise, we need to wait until the data is calculated.

38
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.600
Right.

39
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.130
So I'm just going to add and await key word here, right.

40
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.600
Until we get the data.

41
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.310
And when you add the eight key word, the async should be added to that function as well.

42
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.550
So this is another asynchronous function in here.

43
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.700
Now I'm going to say const converted amount.

44
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.810
And what is the converted amount?

45
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.230
The converted amount is going to be our exchange amount times.

46
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.790
Keep in mind the amount exchange rate.

47
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.560
How cool is that amount exchange rate and this is what we have.

48
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.100
Yeah, it remove the parentheses, but I'm going to add a later.

49
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.740
So now what do we do.

50
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.980
Let's go ahead and let's say cancel the log.

51
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.370
What do we want.

52
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.650
You know what, I'm just going to return this.

53
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.080
I'm going to return it and then we are going to do something with it.

54
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.550
So return are.

55
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.260
Return convert to the amount converted amount.

56
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.890
So now let's call this function here, convert to convert currency.

57
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.820
We know that there are going to be three arguments for this.

58
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.590
So what is the first argument?

59
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.840
Let's pass fan.

60
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.430
What is the second argument?

61
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.160
Let's pass USD.

62
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.000
What is the third argument?

63
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.990
That is the amount one thousand dollars 1000 Afghanis.

64
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.400
All right, so and we are going to say then, because this entire thing is going to return a promise.

65
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.340
So we need to do then and after that.

66
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:20.860
Let's just say exchange results exchange, where are the parentheses, but then exchange results and

67
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.960
I just want to basically console log that exchange.

68
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.790
No, not that exchange result.

69
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.570
OK, so there shouldn't be any space there, perfect.

70
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.870
Let's come here, we get thirteen point zero to and if I come here, so we have 1000 Afghani and that

71
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.140
is 13, almost the same thing.

72
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.810
Of course, this is Google.

73
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.920
This is data that fixed audio.

74
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.680
The rates are going to be a lot of a different like a tad different, a tiny, minuscule difference.

75
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.180
And we can see that we can calculate from any currency to any other currency.

76
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.170
So let's say you want to change Canadian dollars to United States starters and what it would do you

77
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.000
get you're going to get seven fifty seven.

78
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.650
You remember that?

79
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.030
And I think it was the lecture in the first lecture that we started talking about the concepts.

80
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.530
It was seven fifty six.

81
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.880
Yeah, it was seven fifty six and we got seven fifty seven.

82
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.600
It's almost a little bit different.

83
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.020
That's because of the conversion rates.

84
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.830
You can change Canadian dollars to Australian dollars.

85
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.430
Then you're going to get a thousand dollars, right, because I think Canadian dollars are worth more

86
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.850
than Australian dollars.

87
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.160
We can check that out.

88
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.080
So we have CTD right here, one point five four.

89
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.760
So the U.D. should be bigger than one point five four nine.

90
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.010
So, Kudelka, you can see it's one point sixty five.

91
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.660
It's bigger.

92
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.860
I'm an analyst, a financial analyst.

93
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.480
No, I'm not.

94
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.230
I'm just kidding.

95
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.900
So we we have been able to successfully implement this logic.

96
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.190
Now, the other parts, they're not that difficult.

97
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.100
They're simple.

98
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.450
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this message as well.

99
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.650
So if you convert something, you are going to get a message, this message.

100
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.310
So let's create this message and then we are done with this with this lecture.

101
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.210
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say return.

102
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.760
Return what returned them, the exchange amount.

103
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.620
So we have exchange amount and then the exchange amount is going to be a number and then return the

104
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:51.090
from currency, from currency, from this amount, this amount from this currency is worth.

105
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.870
This converted amount converted amount of

106
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.760
converted amount of this currency to currency.

107
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:13.170
Right, so we we are going to return that so you can see that a thousand Canadian dollars is equal to

108
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.620
a thousand point six eight, all these numbers.

109
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.930
So I'm just going to go ahead and say I'm going to fix it to two decimal points.

110
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:27.660
That's why that's what I told you, that we are going to come back and I'm just going to say to fixed

111
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:34.020
and it returns is Trank representing a number in fixed point notation.

112
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.930
So I'm just going to provide it to a number of digits after the decimal point must be in range zero

113
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.030
to two inclusive.

114
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.270
So I'm just going to put it to zero to twenty, sir.

115
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.890
So now you can see that a thousand Canadian dollars is ten sixty eight point oh six.

116
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.360
All right.

117
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.360
So now we are done with this function and with this, of course, we are not going to call it right

118
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.800
away inside the JavaScript.

119
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.360
We are going to call it when we click this get rate or when we submit this for.

120
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.960
So that's it for this lecture.

121
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.490
See you guys in the next one.
