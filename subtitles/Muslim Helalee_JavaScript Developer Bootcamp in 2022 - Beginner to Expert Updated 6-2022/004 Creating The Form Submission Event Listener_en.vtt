00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.990
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.270
In this next year, we are going to create the forum submission event listener.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.760
All right, now, why is that important?

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.470
Why do we need to create the form submission of.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.790
This is important because whenever you click this button or or in or technically when you submit this

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.670
form is when the the superheroes are at it.

7
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.360
Right.

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.230
So you like this.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.820
Perfect.

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.410
So that's when the superheroes are at it.

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.950
Right.

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.410
So this form submission could also work with with clicking this button or just hitting enter.

13
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.610
Doesn't matter.

14
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.610
Even like done specifically key codes for them.

15
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.390
So I'm going to I'm going to come down here and in here.

16
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.030
I'm going to create this comment, this very long comment, and I'm going to say events, because we

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.580
are going to have, I think, two different events.

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.660
So I'm going to say below this line is everything related to events, which has actually nothing to

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.710
do with the classes.

20
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.590
The classes are right here, are not creating classes.

21
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.650
We will be instantiating them here.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.190
So first things first.

23
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.600
Let's grab the our form.

24
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880
OK, so I'm not going to create a comment.

25
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.040
So I'm going to say const form.

26
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.400
We are going to say document, document dot query selector and we're going to select the form by its

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.390
class name, which is Super Hero Dash four.

28
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.260
Right.

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.240
So we have successfully selected that.

30
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.200
We are going to say form that ad event listener and we are listening for when the form is submitted

31
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.180
and when the form is submitted.

32
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.050
We want to run a certain function and we are going to grab the event object associated with this form,

33
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.400
with this event, which is submit first stuff before doing this, before saving all this.

34
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.580
When I click on this, you can see that the page is reloading.

35
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.960
So click page, reload.

36
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.710
That's because it is the default behavior.

37
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.510
So first off, we are going to prevent the default behavior because when we click, we don't want to

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.180
submit anything to the Internet.

39
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.270
We just want to store it inside the superhero list.

40
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.570
Right.

41
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.400
So click stored there.

42
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.100
So first things first.

43
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.060
We need to grab the values for these inputs.

44
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.030
So the values for the superhero input name, then we have the superhero universe, then we have the

45
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.010
submit button.

46
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.700
Now, I know that it's not that visible here.

47
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.500
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to see assess where is the hmm.

48
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.090
Ally.

49
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.830
We have font size.

50
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.210
We have color.

51
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.770
Oh, that's label.

52
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.280
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.480
That's not a lie.

54
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.660
So let's say that let's come to the label.

55
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.180
I'm just going to change the color and we are going to revert to back if I if I remember.

56
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
At the end of this chapter, oops, now this part is not readable.

57
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.310
Well, I didn't think that through.

58
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.170
All right.

59
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.660
Anyway, I'm going I'm going to leave it here.

60
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.180
So let's grab the values from these inputs.

61
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.930
So the way that I wasted two minutes there, I know we are going to use the structuring assignment,

62
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.390
the structuring.

63
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.740
Right.

64
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.490
So first off, we have our superhero superhero name.

65
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.150
Right.

66
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.390
The next and the next one that we want to grab is going to be superhero universe.

67
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.640
And then we have super hero power.

68
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:50.140
Now, the value for the superhero name, basically, we are creating three variables in here and just

69
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.670
one line of code and we are assigning values in this era.

70
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.200
So the first item of this array is going to be assigned to this variable.

71
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.560
The second item of this area is going to assign to this, and the third one is going to be assigned

72
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.930
to this.

73
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.870
This is meant to provide us with easier with less assignment of declarations of light and constant lit

74
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.530
and const.

75
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.960
So we are going to document that query selector.

76
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.200
We have never done this.

77
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.829
Now we are doing it.

78
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.450
So we are going to say no.

79
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.360
So this is going to give us that name input, but we want to grab the value.

80
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.780
So I'm just going to say value and not not value were just we just want to value.

81
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:37.840
Now, this is going to be assigned to superhero name and let's do this two more times.

82
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.820
I'm going to copy it and I'm going to paste it, had a comma, paste it and let's change it to this

83
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.210
time.

84
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.100
It is going to be universe, so universe.

85
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.830
And finally, this one is going to be power.

86
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.410
So let's save it.

87
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.970
That's it for this picture.

88
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.690
See you guys in the next one.
