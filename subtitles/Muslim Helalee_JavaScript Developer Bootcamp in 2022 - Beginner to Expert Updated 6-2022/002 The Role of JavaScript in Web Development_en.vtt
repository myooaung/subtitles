Hi, everyone, in this lecture, I want to talk about the role of JavaScript in what development?

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.660
All right, so as far as Web development is concerned, we have three main underlying technologies.

3
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.190
The first one is HTML or hypertext markup language.

4
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.440
The second one is Cyesis or cascading style sheets.

5
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.800
And the third one, the third main one is JavaScript.

6
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.190
All right.

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.700
So HDMI, as the name sounds, is a hyper text markup language.

8
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.140
It is a markup language.

9
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.990
It is responsible for the content.

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.950
It is responsible for the structure of the Web page.

11
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.280
All right.

12
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.910
So any content, any text, any link, any sort of table, anything, any image that you see on the

13
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.740
Web, that's HDMI, that's what e-mail is responsible for.

14
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.480
The flow of the e-mail document actually defines the structure of any website.

15
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.170
All right, then we have access, which is the like the sort of like the makeup of the language.

16
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.180
OK, it's not markup, it's makeup.

17
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.810
Like, it's it's like making Web pages more beautiful.

18
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.560
All right.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.030
So it is a stylesheet language.

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:31.350
OK, then we have JavaScript, JavaScript is a programming language who's one of whose applications

21
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.870
is creating front end Web applications, right.

22
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.680
So when we talk about front end web application, it means that we are activating our Web pages.

23
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.000
We are making them more dynamic and we are making them interactive.

24
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.540
So what does interactive mean?

25
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.590
Interactive means that the website actually talks to a user.

26
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.580
OK, the website grabs the user's password and username and allows it to enter.

27
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.250
It's his or her account.

28
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.610
Right.

29
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.700
And also not only that, what pages also or web applications not only interact with the user, but they

30
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.750
also interact with other applications or or servers as well.

31
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.590
That is the job of JavaScript as well.

32
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.790
Now, this all might seem like vague and ambiguous, but we are going to get to this to the fun stuff

33
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.980
very, very soon.

34
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.450
So see you guys in the next lecture.
