00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.430
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we going to create the budget in function.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.600
All right, so so far, we know whenever we insert stuff or bites inside our expense structure, we

3
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.680
can track those expenses, but what about the income?

4
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.740
So we need to create the budget in function as well.

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.990
And this part, I'm sure, is really, really clear for you guys.

6
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.270
But inside this budget out.

7
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.400
What do we what we are lacking is whenever I enter something and when I click on the ad, we cannot

8
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.530
really see our budget without income or expense to be loaded here inside the list.

9
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.530
Basically, we are not updating the UI, so I'm going to create an update UI function and I'm going

10
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.440
to call it here.

11
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.790
Well, we are going to create it in our next lecture, but we are going to call it here and we are going

12
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.540
to create a clear input function as well.

13
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.210
Now, why clear input?

14
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.100
We know the update UI.

15
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.280
So if I come here and if I say salary.

16
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.540
So are three, and if I type 1000, so whenever I click on it, you can see that this these then put

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.000
is reset.

18
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
The input is reset has been reset.

19
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.200
Yeah, the input has been reset.

20
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.470
It means that nothing is written inside the input anymore and the UI has been updated.

21
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.840
So the update UI function is responsible for this, responsible for this income, for this chart, for

22
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.300
the balance, for the outcome, for the for the expense and for the all.

23
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.670
So the update UI function is going to be the largest function that we would have.

24
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.920
Now, whenever we want to clear the inputs we are, we want to clear two kinds of inputs.

25
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.220
The first one is going to be the title and the second one is going to be the amount.

26
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.840
So whenever the user hits enter or clicks on the add key, we want to clear that the input is going

27
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.480
to be saved inside the update UI function and we want to clear out of that.

28
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.600
So instead of calling this function twice, I'm just going to pass in an array as an argument.

29
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.330
The first input that I want to be clear, it is going to be expensed title.

30
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.270
We are going to create this function, don't worry about it.

31
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.890
And the second one is going to be expense amount.

32
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.310
So now that this budget out is created, we are going to go ahead and we are going to create the budget.

33
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.820
And now the budget in is going to be a replica of that function because we are going to have basically

34
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.410
everything is going to be the same here, except we will create an income and we are going to grab the

35
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.630
income title and income amount.

36
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.440
All right.

37
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.640
I'm not going to copy it.

38
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.630
I'm just going to go ahead and create it so you know where everything comes.

39
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.820
All right, so let's go ahead and let's create the function it is budget in and we are going to pass

40
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.120
and the e the event object because we need it to prevent the default behavior.

41
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.380
So let's grab the E and say prevent default.

42
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.080
Save it.

43
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.450
Prevent default.

44
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.990
Right.

45
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.550
Correct.

46
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.270
And now let's check if the income title and the income amount are not empty, if they're empty, we

47
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.010
do not want to run anything.

48
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.160
So if they're empty, we do not want to create an object and push it to the interest.

49
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.530
Basically, we don't want to do anything.

50
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.470
So we are going to say the same kind of statement, income title.

51
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.610
Dot value returns, false or it means that it is zero.

52
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.920
It is like empty or the income amount data value.

53
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.060
Then what do we want to do?

54
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.140
We want to return from the function.

55
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.690
That's it.

56
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.370
We don't want the function to run.

57
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.090
So.

58
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.770
So this statement, this expression is going to return to true.

59
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.340
All right.

60
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.110
But whenever you add in, you tag another, not Anani quality.

61
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.360
It's like a negative sign.

62
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.430
So negative times positive you are going to end with and we are going to end up with a negative.

63
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.040
So if this is false, we want to return from the function and this is a logical or operator, this this

64
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.500
entire condition becomes true with us when at least one side of this expression is true.

65
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.280
All right.

66
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.860
So when this is false.

67
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.710
Well, actually, when there is nothing inside this income title, it means that the income title,

68
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.420
that value is false, false times in negative or false times false.

69
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.680
You are going to end up with a positive and this condition is true.

70
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.010
So we are going to return from the function.

71
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.940
The same thing is going to go for the income amount.

72
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.160
I'm going to explain it, of course.

73
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.430
So if incomer amount is false, it means there is nothing inside of it and then we are going to multiply

74
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.850
that false by another false.

75
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.970
We are going to end up with the true here.

76
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.010
So whenever one side of this logical operator or operator is true, this entire condition becomes true

77
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.770
and this func, this return key is going to run and it is going to prevent this entire function from

78
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.180
running.

79
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.200
So we are either going to have one of the inputs being empty or both of them being empty.

80
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.680
And in all three conditions, the function is going to return.

81
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.340
Let's create the object it is we are going to name it income, of course, the type.

82
00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.080
Is going to be income and the title now, this is the object that are in the first lecture, I think

83
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.130
it was the first lecture.

84
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.500
This is exactly that object that I showed you inside the local storage, inside the allies.

85
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.190
This is the same object.

86
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.320
So we are going to push this object to our enteral entry list and then the entry list is going to be

87
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.430
pushed to the ellis'.

88
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.260
So we are going to grab our income title and we are going to grab the value from their.

89
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.740
We are going to do the same thing for amount as we did for expense, we are going to grab our parts,

90
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.020
we could go parts, float or pass integer.

91
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.040
I'm going to do pass.

92
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.600
Float doesn't really matter.

93
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.400
And we are going to say income amount, dot value.

94
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:53.080
All right, so now we have this let's push it to the centralists array, because we have only one or

95
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.340
right.

96
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.930
And inside that array, we might have an expense.

97
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.100
We might have an income.

98
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.440
Well, you might have a combination.

99
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.860
We might have a combination of both of them.

100
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:08.380
So entry list, dot, push, push this item in.

101
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.690
We are going to say income just passed the name.

102
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.530
And finally, we are going to grab our update UI function and we are going to call it here, and after

103
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.180
the user inserts done inserting in the field, we are going to clear that.

104
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.770
So in this case, we are going to clear the income title first and then the income amount.

105
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:38.980
All right, so now that these functions they're created, I can just go ahead and test this out, console

106
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.450
that log.

107
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:50.600
We could say income and then I could say type of now, because in our previous lecture, the reason

108
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.230
that this doesn't work, didn't work is because this is used for selecting the index, selecting an

109
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:04.370
item inside an array, using their index, which is not like a proper method, a proper property of

110
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.400
object, because incoming is an object.

111
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.980
We should use the DOT notation.

112
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.400
So we are going to set amount type of amount.

113
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.310
Let's come here now, in case you're wondering about this, if I come in here and if I click here,

114
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:25.970
this is like same site, same, say, LAX, it is basically a problem with the font.

115
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.330
Awesome that we have inserted, apparently Google Chrome.

116
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.950
Dev, change something up.

117
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.860
You know, it's really complicated.

118
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.549
I tend not to worry about it.

119
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.500
And this exactly says where were the problem?

120
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.289
What is the cookie.

121
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:39.950
It's from font.

122
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.370
Awesome.

123
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.919
So just do not pay attention to it.

124
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.350
Salary.

125
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:52.400
Let's enter 1100 and whenever I click on the add it does not run.

126
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.530
So let's go ahead and let's see.

127
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.030
So we have income.

128
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.310
Income is pushed to the entry list.

129
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.620
OK, this is the event is the event was oops.

130
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:18.130
The event was commented out of Putin salary, salary, so I don't know, I can add and we can say that.

131
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:27.780
We can see here the type this is income title, salary and type of operator returns, no, don't worry

132
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.380
about this one.

133
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.230
We are going to fix that.

134
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.600
So this is it for oops, what am I doing?

135
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.410
Penta taskbar closed the window.

136
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:42.470
OK, so we are done with our budget out and budget and functions in our next lecture.

137
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.910
We are we will be starting creating the update UI and the clear inputs function.

138
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.420
See you guys then.
