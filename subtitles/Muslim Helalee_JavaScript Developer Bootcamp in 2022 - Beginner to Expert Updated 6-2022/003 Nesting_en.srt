00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,790
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,880
In this next year, we are going to talk about nesting.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,840
All right, so first off, we're going to take a look at nesting objects within objects, right?

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:24,940
So what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to create an object called user and we are going

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,020
to open our curly braces, which is the syntax for object, OK?

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,610
And I'm going to create my first key, OK?

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,360
And it is going to be Thunderbolt.

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,940
Thunder Bolt.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,610
Thirty seven, right, and the value is going to be another object, OK, so the key is Thunderbird

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,050
three seven and the value is going to be another object because I want to pair some information as the

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,090
value for the thunderbolt.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,200
Thirty seven key.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:55,710
All right.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:04,890
So I'm going to say my name is Ross and job is classified.

15
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:05,910
Right.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,810
And then we are going to put in a comma.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,210
Now, this is the end of this key value pair, and we should put in a comma, OK?

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,510
And I'm going to say paygrade.

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,290
Paygrade is a right, let's save it now.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,870
OK, so now we have successfully nested one object inside the other object, right?

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,210
So let's go ahead and let's consider log user.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,260
And we have Thunderbird 37.

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,510
You guys can see that on the outer part we have our curly braces, which means that it is an object.

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,380
And inside there we have another object.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,630
OK, so it's an object nested within another object.

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,870
This is how we can nyst objects and we can access the information of the nested object as well.

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,380
All right.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,110
So the way we do that is usually the best practice is through the bracket notation.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,240
So I'm just going to say Thunderbolt Thunderbolt three seven.

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,940
If I save it now, we get another object.

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,580
And this object has two key value pairs.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,270
One is job classified and the other one is named Ross.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,240
We can get those information as well.

34
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:27,970
We just say Dutney and we've just got Russ, all right, and we are, as far as the key value pairs

35
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,200
themselves are concerned, we can use dot notation.

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,630
All right.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,380
We have talked about how and where we should not use dot notation or the DOT syntax and the brackets

38
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,990
syntax.

39
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,330
All right.

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,670
And we can grab the job as well.

41
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,360
And the job is classified.

42
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,130
All right.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,280
So this is nesting objects within objects.

44
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,330
The next thing that I want to talk about is nesting arrays within objects.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,710
We can nest arrays within objects as well.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,170
All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create an object, and

47
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,670
inside that, we are going to nest an array.

48
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,350
All right.

49
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:14,750
So it's again, it is going to be user and we are going to open our curly braces for the.

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,080
Object syntax, right?

51
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:26,390
And again, we are going to say Thunder Bolt 37, right, and the value is going to be another object.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,580
So it's actually nesting an object in an array within another object.

53
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,510
Right.

54
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,380
But the main part is the array that we are going to nest inside.

55
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,470
You name is.

56
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,100
You know what?

57
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm just going to go ahead and copy it, copy all this from there.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,510
And I'm going to post it here and I'm going to uncommented all of them.

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,660
So so far, we know how we can do that and the way we can this scenario is we just open brackets and

60
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,230
that's it.

61
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,510
But this is not an array.

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,980
This is the value.

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,310
Right.

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,510
Where was the name?

65
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,760
Where is the key?

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,780
We should provide it with keys as well.

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,660
So we are going to say hobbies and this, that hobbies is going to be the key and the value is going

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,920
to be another array.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,450
And we are going to say golf.

70
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:21,930
Walk and because this is a strength provided in quotations and we are going to say give out.

71
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,560
Orders.

72
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,190
Let's save it, so now we have successfully nested an array within another object, right?

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,230
We can say console the log user, let's save it.

74
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,500
It's come here.

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,770
So we have this Hobie's.

76
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,800
It is an array.

77
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,370
Right.

78
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,020
And we have the rest is an object and we do have another object nested inside as well.

79
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,030
And this is usually the way that JavaScript is done when we get to our real work projects, because

80
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:00,840
when we work with real world projects, we are working with very, very complex data and we usually

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,040
pair up arrays and objects together to meet our demands to meet the demands of the application.

82
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Right.

83
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:15,360
And the way we can grab or access the values is we can just go ahead and say hobbies.

84
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:24,420
We are going to get an array QAQA and we can say, for example, we can access the items within an array

85
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,560
through their index.

86
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,700
For example, the index of zero is going to give me gothe.

87
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,590
OK, so we can do this as well.

88
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,420
Well, actually I should provide them in two different console logs, so it is not confusing.

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,320
All right.

90
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,170
So this is nesting arrays within objects.

91
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,530
We can nest objects within arrays as well, right?

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,950
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead.

93
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,600
Nesting objects within a race, we can do that as well.

94
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,000
Now we are going to create a constant which is user again, and now we open brackets, which is the

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,220
syntax for arrays, right.

96
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:13,040
So the first key sorry, the first value or the first item within this user is array is going to be

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,560
an object and that object is going to have a name and the value for name is going to be Tony.

98
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:26,390
And the job is another key and the value for that key is going to be complicated.

99
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,130
All right and OK, so this is the first item inside this, even though this item is an object, but

100
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,710
this is the first item inside this array.

101
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,610
All right.

102
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,570
So the next item, we can just go ahead and write compassionate.

103
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,390
All right, and another one we can also add, as you guys know, we can nest arrays within arrays as

104
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,830
well, so I can create an array here as well.

105
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,310
So making a right.

106
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,490
So where is the BRAC?

107
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,200
The quotations, making suits.

108
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,030
All right, and.

109
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,870
Destroying, destroying suits.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,500
All right, so now we have successfully nested an object and another array within the user's array.

111
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,850
Let's go ahead and log it to the console so we can see our data.

112
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,320
And now you guys can see the outer brackets, they are represented by the outer parts, they're represented

113
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,310
by brackets, meaning that it is an array and the array length is three.

114
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,000
But this one, if I click on this one, this is an object.

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,630
Right.

116
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:43,590
And we can of course, of course, all always we can access very easily the information that we want

117
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,110
so we can access them because they're arrays.

118
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,750
We can access them by their index.

119
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,430
That is the easiest way that we can do.

120
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,810
And we get an object and from there we can access the information within that object as well.

121
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,120
For example, let's grab the job and we are going to get complicated.

122
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,200
All right.

123
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,570
And we can use a template, literal as well here.

124
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,500
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to cut this part and I'm going to use back ticks and I'm going

125
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,120
to open our template literal.

126
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,620
I'm going to put it there is toonies Char.

127
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,060
OK, complicated is Tony's job getting Yoda away?

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,310
OK, so that is going to be it for this lecture.

129
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,159
See you guys in the next one.
