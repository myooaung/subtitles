00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:13.160
Hi, everyone, in this we're going to move the gallery based on the mouse move event, Auri, so let's

2
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.780
go ahead and let's see what it is that we are going to do here.

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.650
Now, there is a problem with this gallery.

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.060
Still, there are a lot.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.730
But I want to point out this one.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.520
So when I click on Unclick, we can see that the mouse down and mouse up, they were perfectly fine.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.090
And we saw how mouse live works fine as well.

8
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.010
But what about the mouse move whenever the mouse is move moving.

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.870
So if I click and if I move, we can see that there was a not allowed cursor.

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.240
Right.

11
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.520
This is the not allowed.

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.600
And if I release it, we are still inside what state?

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.140
This is the act if this is the active clause that we added.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.280
So we are still here.

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.200
We are still at our original.

16
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.560
But what about here?

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.740
So if I come into the final project, so if I click we can move it and unclick so we never get that

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.569
null allowed.

19
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.790
So let's go ahead and let's implement this this functionality.

20
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.380
So from here, I'm going to remove this.

21
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.070
Right.

22
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.130
I just removed it and I'm going to create another event listener, which is going to be, of course,

23
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.030
our final event listener.

24
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.180
OK, so inside here, this is going to be the mouse move and this event is going to be responsible for

25
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.670
moving the gallery.

26
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.100
Right.

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.560
So whenever you want to move it from one side to the next side, this is the event and the event name

28
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.490
is Mouse Move.

29
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.240
And we are going to say function, which is a callback function, and we are going to trace the event

30
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.840
itself.

31
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.460
But first things first.

32
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.020
I'm going to say if is down is not true.

33
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.540
We want to return from the function.

34
00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.130
If we are not in the down state, we do not want to we do not want this function to go forward.

35
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.360
But this is still like this condition says that when the F is down is true return.

36
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.080
This is the opposite of what we want.

37
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.260
So I'm just going to like, put there a inarticulately operator.

38
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.440
And this this is not equality quality, not operator.

39
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.270
Sorry, this is a not operator.

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.360
And this says when that is down is false return.

41
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.610
OK, so after that, what I want to do is I want to say prevent I want to prevent the default behavior

42
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.490
of this mouse move.

43
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.840
Right.

44
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.210
So whenever we are here now we can see, we do not see that.

45
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.920
And now we are we are back to our like mouse up and mouse down.

46
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.170
We do not see that not allowed, OK, because by default, you are not allowed to move elements from

47
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.080
one side to the next.

48
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.570
So this is ironic because the event's name is Mouse Move and still you're not allowed.

49
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.750
This is, if you remember, exactly like the drag and drop API that we were working with that originally

50
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.350
or by default, you are not allowed to drag or drop anything.

51
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.820
So it's even says drag start, but it's, you know, or drag and or drag over or whatever it is, the

52
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.960
drag API.

53
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.840
But it's you have to say either prevent default, you have to prevent the default behavior that doesn't

54
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.790
allow you to do that specific thing for which the event has been created.

55
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.440
I mean, this is ironic.

56
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.630
All right.

57
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.640
So at this point, we have created this and we have removed I think that not allowed that we had there.

58
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.480
Now, what I want to do in here is I want to specify the amount that the user has scrolled to the left.

59
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.390
So I'm going to come into the mouse down and we have created this scroll left.

60
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.520
And you know what?

61
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.770
What I'm going to do is, first off, let's go ahead.

62
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.060
And what is that?

63
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:11.240
I'm going to console log something here, and that is slider dot, scroll left, scroll, scroll left.

64
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.510
Let's go ahead and let's see what this gives us.

65
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.700
So I'm going to zoom out because that's better.

66
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.360
We can see this better.

67
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.220
So where is inspect?

68
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.940
We are here.

69
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.120
So if I come here and if I click, we can see the scroll left to zero.

70
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.220
It doesn't matter where we click because we have not scrolled it any.

71
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.380
That's why the scroll left is zero.

72
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.550
So I want to grab the scroll left, this scroll left and I want to set it to the slider that scroll

73
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.850
left.

74
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.770
And in case you're wondering, you know what?

75
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.500
I kind of forgot to give you these resources.

76
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.950
So this is the resource for the offset left.

77
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.260
So I'm just going to put it right here.

78
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.670
If you want to read about Offset Left, this is the resource for that.

79
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.560
If you want to read about the scroll left, you can read about it here.

80
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.820
Now, don't miss.

81
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.420
Taking this scroll left with this one, I should have probably changed, I should probably say, to

82
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.590
left, because this is a variable that we have created.

83
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.180
This is something that is available by JavaScript.

84
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.460
There should be a difference.

85
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.650
So I'm going to say scroll to left should be equal to slider dot.

86
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.910
Scroll left.

87
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.740
Scroll left.

88
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.530
Yeah, so that's what I wanted to do here and now we we know exactly where we are scrolling, how much

89
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.020
we are scrolling, whenever we scroll the image, we can get that specific number.

90
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.430
And that number is going to tell us how much the image has been scrawled, how sorry, how much the

91
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.470
mouse has been scrawled so we can scroll the image by that amount.

92
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.620
OK, I'm going to tell you how this actually works.

93
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.670
So I'm going to create a constant here and I'm going to call it X.

94
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:14.670
I could just call it this turns X, X Files, files X, and we are going to say either page X and we

95
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.010
are going to do the same thing.

96
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.780
OK, Slider, that offset offset left.

97
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:31.110
OK, so now we have initialized the start X right here and we have given it a value right here and now

98
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.670
we want to grab this value and we want to store it inside our distance X as well.

99
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.360
Right.

100
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.240
And now I want to create before this.

101
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.220
Let's go ahead and let's say council log.

102
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.870
All right.

103
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.470
And if you want to grab the values there is this is the a handy trick.

104
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:54.570
If you want to grab values from the from the variables that you have created, just put them inside

105
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.360
a like an object.

106
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.770
So I'm just going to say start X as well.

107
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:09.000
So now if I click and if I move, it says, oops, it is X, this is distance X, distance X and excuse

108
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.620
me, start.

109
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.170
So now when I move we can see that this says distance X is 200 start X..

110
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.800
So what does this actually going to give us the start.

111
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.120
X is going to give us exactly where the user has clicked.

112
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.830
The distance is going to give us is going to tell us how much the user has moved or how much the user

113
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.840
has deviated from that point where the user has clicked.

114
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.060
So when I click here, the start X should be like something very small.

115
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.840
But when I move the distance X should be like something bigger.

116
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:54.060
So now we can see that the start X says right here, it says that the distance, the starting point

117
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.630
was to.

118
00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.680
And how much have we deviated from that starting point by 116 pixels.

119
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.120
So I'm going to do it one more time.

120
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.910
So I'm going to click here and I'm going to drag it all the way to here.

121
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.300
And this should give us like almost fourteen hundred because that is the width of this container.

122
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.250
So click here and come all the way to here.

123
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.300
So this is going to give us.

124
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.650
And what is the final one.

125
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.410
The final one is thirteen ninety seven.

126
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.180
We started a two.

127
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:32.130
And we ended at this, so this is, again, one more time, this is going to give us where the distance

128
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.500
has started and this is going to give us that exact distance that we have traveled.

129
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:44.610
OK, so if I click here and come this way, we can see that the distance is decreasing.

130
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.260
Click here, come this way.

131
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.180
The distance is increasing, but we can track that distance.

132
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.440
That's why we have said distance X.

133
00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:00.880
And is because it's in the X direction and now what I want to do is I want to create another variable

134
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.750
and that variable is going to tell us how far we move either to their right or to the left from the

135
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.850
initial point, even though this distance it is going to give us that.

136
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.100
But there is a problem with that.

137
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.040
And what is the problem with this now?

138
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.500
I'm just going to click here and I'm going to move to this point.

139
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.090
Right.

140
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:29.110
And now the distances to all 42 pixels, even though we have clicked right in the middle of this like

141
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.520
this break point for these images and we move to to here.

142
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.500
So we should get like almost six, 700.

143
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.160
But why?

144
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.960
It is twelve for the two.

145
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.190
The reason for that is it is grabbing districts.

146
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.790
And also from there, we are going to say that we have traveled by this much.

147
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:55.330
So if the start X is zero, then this traveling distance is going to be accurate because the Starbucks

148
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:55.840
is zero.

149
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.250
But if the start X is, for example, 319.

150
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.220
So I'm going to I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.

151
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.770
So let's zoom in for this.

152
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.050
So like like really zoom in.

153
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.880
So where should I go?

154
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.340
What should I do here?

155
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:18.490
How should I a so so the distance we know that this there's this big container is fourteen hundred pixels.

156
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.790
Right.

157
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.480
So what is the distance from this year to this year.

158
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.750
It should roughly be like two hundred and fifty something pixels, some 300 pixels.

159
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.980
It shouldn't be more than that.

160
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:36.430
So when I grab it and if I come here to this distance and I release it, it's this thirteen, thirty

161
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:44.260
four, you know, like, like does it mean that from, from this year to this year we have thirteen

162
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.870
hundred and thirty four pixels.

163
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.920
Now we are basically moving almost three hundred and twenty five.

164
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.290
Yeah.

165
00:10:53.650 --> 00:11:01.930
Three hundred and twenty five pixels because if you subtract the statistics from the distance X we are

166
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.370
going to get that amount and then we will know exactly how much we have walked.

167
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.570
So consed I hope you, you know what I mean.

168
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.150
So I'm going to grab the distance X.

169
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:23.280
It's at a distance X and I'm going to subtract from there the Starbucks and and now we will know exactly

170
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.290
how much we have moved.

171
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:32.550
OK, so let's say Consol does log the walk.

172
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.300
OK, now if I click and if I go, we can see that we have moved one hundred and eighty and we can go,

173
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.550
we can go all the way to 800.

174
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:49.710
So now if I click from this year to this year, this is three hundred and twenty, almost three hundred

175
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.370
and twenty five, which we had before.

176
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.110
This is not thirteen hundred.

177
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.620
This is almost 300.

178
00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:02.040
But if I go from here all the way to here, we should get fourteen hundred, thirteen hundred and ninety

179
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.340
seven.

180
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.090
So almost fourteen hundred.

181
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.330
So now we have, we know exactly how much we have moved.

182
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:16.750
From that starting point, keep that in mind from the starting point, not from the container start,

183
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:24.700
but from the start X. We want to know that, but what Starbucks gave us was distance X gave us.

184
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.320
It was from the starting point, sorry, from this starting.

185
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.480
It was from the container start, not the starting point.

186
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:40.090
Now, this walk is going to give us how much we have deviated from the point that we have clicked,

187
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.450
how much we have moved from the point that we have clicked.

188
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:49.030
And now that we know it, what do we want this value to be assigned to?

189
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.520
This value should be assigned to the slider that scroll left.

190
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:04.240
OK, and we are going to say, Slider, that scroll left, let's assign it to walk.

191
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.560
Just assign it to walk and let's.

192
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.580
OK, it doesn't do anything, OK?

193
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.740
Oh, so now if I come here.

194
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.570
And if I do it, you know, it's kind of shaky, it doesn't.

195
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.250
So come on, buddy, it's not working correctly.

196
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:38.440
It's come here, check it out, so I thought, OK, scroll, hmmm, I should not set it to walk.

197
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.930
Let's set it to scroll to left.

198
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.330
Let's set it to this one.

199
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:53.080
And this is still not working, and slider, that scroll left and set it to walk.

200
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.430
Let's set it to scroll left minus walk.

201
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.740
Let's see if this works.

202
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:05.200
And now we can see that it works perfectly fine, OK, because the scroll left.

203
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.040
This is the scroll to left.

204
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.960
This is basically zero.

205
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:16.480
This is going to give us how much the container, the distance of the container from this side of the

206
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.920
page.

207
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.060
This is going to give us the scroll left.

208
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.140
How much we have scroll.

209
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.760
We know that the initial value is going to be zero, right?

210
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.210
Wherever we click.

211
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:25.950
That was zero.

212
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.680
And now we can see that it works because we just have to, like, subtract that from the walk.

213
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:40.820
So if we just put and walk here, it is shaky, it doesn't work like how we want it, see, so if I

214
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.640
do this, it works like this.

215
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.670
So it works in the negative direction.

216
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.840
See, it works like that.

217
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.140
See negative, negative, negative.

218
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.140
And it always starts from this from the first.

219
00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:01.040
So even if I click on the zebra and if I drag it, we can see we can we have our tiger buddy here.

220
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:08.720
If I click on this deer and if I click come all the way to these parrots and if I click on the parrots

221
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.400
and move, we are still we go back to our like slider once more.

222
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.080
That's why I'm just going to go ahead and add a negative sign there.

223
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.090
And now let's see.

224
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.760
And now it moves in this direction.

225
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.300
But it is.

226
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.810
It is still have it.

227
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:26.930
It still has.

228
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.360
I hope I'm not confusing you.

229
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.300
It still has that jump.

230
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:38.210
So so we are coming, for example, to these parrots when I come and click on the parrots and I want

231
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.550
to drag it to the next image that we have.

232
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.810
So we are here.

233
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.680
And when I click it and when I mouse move, we should see the hamsters.

234
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.140
OK, so come to the parrot.

235
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.020
But when I move it, we don't see the hamsters.

236
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.720
We are back at the starting point.

237
00:15:53.180 --> 00:16:00.420
So how can we solve this problem is just minus that a scroll to left value that we have.

238
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.570
So now you can see it works.

239
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.020
And the reason that assists scroll to left because the original scroll is going to be to the left and

240
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.880
then when the scroll to the left happens, then the scroll is going to be through.

241
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.270
Right.

242
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.460
So if I grab it, come on top release it.

243
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.990
Come here.

244
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.840
Nothing works.

245
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.150
So this is how you can create.

246
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.030
I know this was like a bit confusing.

247
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.680
This might have been a bit confusing, I feel like, but I don't think this was confusing.

248
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:34.400
And the reason for that it might have been a bit confusing is we we kind of think differently.

249
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.810
There wasn't a lot of code, you know, but we are thinking in a different context that set for this

250
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:41.110
structure.

251
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.070
See you guys in the next project.
