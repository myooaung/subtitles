00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.330
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to add superheroes to the local storage.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.290
All right, so we have called our method and you can see that this is the difference between calling

3
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.670
static and non static methods where we didn't instantiate this superhero class like we did here.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.460
We just called the method directly on it.

5
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.650
Let's save our changes.

6
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.210
Let's come up here.

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:40.980
And I'm just going to come this I'm going to say get superheros from El's and I'm going to copy that

8
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.070
and I'm going to bring it down here and I'm going to say add it.

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.150
So before getting, we should be able to add him to the local storage.

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.010
Right.

11
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.620
OK, so let's go ahead and let's say static.

12
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.620
Static and we're going to add a superhero and we are going to pass in the entry.

13
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.710
So first off, what are we going to do is I'm going to create a constant called superheroes superheroes

14
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.470
list, and I'm going to now here is where these methods are interconnected.

15
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.250
We are going to call this get superhero method because we are going to grab the methods from here.

16
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.240
We are going to grab the superheroes from here because we checked.

17
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.240
If it has, superheroes should get it.

18
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.670
So we are now, this is the good thing about.

19
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.300
About static methods, you just call the class and you say, dot, get superhero.

20
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.280
That's it.

21
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.370
So if we were to call it the other way around, we would have instantiated first and then called it

22
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.980
so.

23
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.020
That's like multiple times of instantiations.

24
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.660
So we are going to say that superhero last.

25
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.430
We are going to push to it the entry.

26
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.039
Right, so now we have here we have if there is nothing inside the superhero, inside the superheroes

27
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.170
array, if there is nothing, it is going to return an empty array.

28
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.970
And when it returns an empty array and we have our entry here, we just push our entry to that superhero

29
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.920
array right when we push it to that array.

30
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.780
There is something that we need to take care of, and that is we need to convert it to Jason file.

31
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.450
Right.

32
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.370
So we are going to say, Jason, that string of ify this is going to convert it to a Jason strength.

33
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.060
OK, so a JavaScript value, usually an object or a right to be converted.

34
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:55.150
We want to convert it to two adjacent string converts, a JavaScript value to a JavaScript object notation

35
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.170
string or adjacent string.

36
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.460
So what it is that we want to convert it to to that we want to convert the superheros list.

37
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.280
So superheros list.

38
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.790
Now, when we convert it, we need to set it to we need to set it to local storage.

39
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.080
So we are going to say set item whenever oops n that set item.

40
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.160
And this is a Jason method.

41
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.600
All right.

42
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.230
And I'm going to say local storage dot.

43
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.960
Zoraida, so is it is it correct today, local, no, this is not so rich.

44
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.810
OK, perfect.

45
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.770
So what we did here is we grabbed because there was nothing inside the superhero entry.

46
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.750
We grabbed our entry.

47
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.990
We pushed it to the superhero illest, which we added from this method.

48
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.340
We grabbed it from here.

49
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.280
We pushed it there, and then we grabbed that superhero list and we converted it to Jason.

50
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.760
We started inside, we said we.

51
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.420
We added we called a set item method on the Jason Right, which in this case we don't really need,

52
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.390
Jason said item is a method of local storage.

53
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.279
We said on the local storage set an item.

54
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.710
Now an item requires a key and a value.

55
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.090
So if you come here, you can see that it requires a key and a value.

56
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.200
So set item actually has two arguments.

57
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.260
One is going to be a key, the other one is going to be a value.

58
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.160
What is the key?

59
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.730
The key is going to be superhero superheros.

60
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.260
So if I save it now, if we go ahead and check it out, it should work.

61
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.390
So let's add Superman and DC Fly Kleck.

62
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.920
You can see that it has been added here and if I click, it has been added here as well.

63
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.960
Let's add rocket as well.

64
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.000
Kleck added here and added here.

65
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.760
All right, so everything works perfectly fine.

66
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.920
The only thing remaining is that whenever we reload the page, you can see that our data is still inside

67
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.510
the local stories, but they have been removed from the UI.

68
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.590
So actually there are two things remaining.

69
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.980
One, we need to retrieve our data from the local storage.

70
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.700
And two, whenever I click on the trash icon, when I click on this, it should remove the USA from

71
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.300
here as well as from the local storage.

72
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.860
So that's it for this year.

73
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.560
See you guys in the next one.
