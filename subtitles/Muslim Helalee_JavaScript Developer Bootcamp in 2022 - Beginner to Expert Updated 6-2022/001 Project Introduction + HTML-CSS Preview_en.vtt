00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.680
Hi, everyone, welcome to a yet another fun project.

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.230
In this chapter, we are going to create a very nice looking and working, of course, working piano

3
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.550
at.

4
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.090
All right, so this app works in two ways, you can go ahead and click on any of these piano buttons

5
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.590
and it is going to play a note for you.

6
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.690
The note is the notes that I've used here.

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.479
You can just download them from the Internet.

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.710
We have quite a lot of them.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.290
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

10
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.910
We have 12 notes here.

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.920
You can download them from the Internet.

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.410
And if you want to follow along and code along, make sure to copy this notes folder inside the directory

13
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.960
of your vehicle or your code editor.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.800
All right.

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.470
So you can do ahead and you can go ahead and click on these buttons and you can use the the Z key all

16
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.800
the way to the M to play the White Keys and the S and D.

17
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.500
So this key, this one is s, this one is D and this one is G H and also J.

18
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.570
So this has been created like think of it as a keyboard.

19
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.180
So I'm just going to grab on screen keyboard and I'm going to show you.

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.610
So let's make this smaller and let's bring it here.

21
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:36.730
So Z when I click there, if I click it is going to play that then X then see the B and I'm all right,

22
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.480
I'm just going to increase the volume so it is you can hear it better.

23
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.000
So we have s d g h j.

24
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.660
Right.

25
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.450
So this is where the keys are.

26
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.140
This is how this has been created.

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.960
Right.

28
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.780
So you can click on this and play.

29
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.720
Of course, I cannot play piano.

30
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.620
I don't know how to play.

31
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.750
I've created it, but I don't know how to play it.

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.660
All right.

33
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.530
So this is the app that we are going to create in this chapter.

34
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.370
Now, let's go over the demo.

35
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.410
Well, this is like the simplest estimate so far.

36
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:17.320
We have a diff container for all the buttons where we have a key, which which also each of these but

37
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.180
device, they're actually our buttons for the piano.

38
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.940
So each of them is going to have a data note C, D, flat D, E, flat E, we have F, G flat, a flat,

39
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.050
A, B flat and B, all right.

40
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.250
So these are the data notes.

41
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.620
The class one is going to be key white.

42
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.930
So this is this key block, all of them.

43
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.100
They have two classes, a key class on a a class of common and a class of different.

44
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.070
Then we have all of our ideas here, like casually inside this body.

45
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.030
We have again now the representation should be the same.

46
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.270
The order should be the same.

47
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.860
So when we have C note inside, which is the first div, the first audio should be C as well.

48
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.440
So then we have D flat.

49
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.490
We have defined here we have D the third one E flat, then we have E F and all the way down and the

50
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.320
notes they have to be selected in that order as well.

51
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.900
So that was the e-mail.

52
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.420
The CSF, super simple.

53
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.410
We have our normal.

54
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.060
We have our normal reset, which I forgot to bring in the padding and margin, and then we have the

55
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.860
body, we have the piano itself, which is a display flex.

56
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.920
We have the white keys, some styling for the white keys.

57
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.450
We have a dynamic class of active and we have two dynamic classes.

58
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.910
One is active for the white key and one is active for the black, because whenever you click on the

59
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.530
white key, you can see that the background color changes to a light kind of grayish color.

60
00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.350
And when you click on this black kid, the background color changes to, again, the same kind of color.

61
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.600
It's it's actually like different shades of this gray color.

62
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.580
We have some styling for the Black Keys and we have a dynamic class for black.

63
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.720
Now, there is a cool trick here.

64
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.079
Now the width of these black keys is 60 pixels.

65
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.530
But if I were to go ahead and remove the margins and come here because this is our project, this is

66
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.890
how they would look like.

67
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.210
All right.

68
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.230
So if changed the background, this was the original project that I created.

69
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.390
But I don't think that it looks cool.

70
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.930
So I just I just go ahead and change it to darker grey kind of color.

71
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.430
So this is how they look like.

72
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.670
Right.

73
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.500
But if I provide the model left and the margin right, so this part is going to be margin left until

74
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.980
half of this with and this part is going to be margin.

75
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.510
Right.

76
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.210
Half of this.

77
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.540
Then the keys are going to appear on top of each other.

78
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.040
A very nice trick that we can use.

79
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.800
So let's bring back to bring it back to reset.

80
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.320
So this is our final hour, but this is something that we need to work with.

81
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.830
So Indianness, starting from the next lecture, we are going to dive into the sea is sorry to the JavaScript

82
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.850
part of this piano.

83
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.390
Of course, this is not limited to just 12 keys.

84
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.160
You can increase the number of keys you can create like a huge piano.

85
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:27.350
But this this is going to give you an idea of how you can create a Web app, web application for a piano.

86
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.080
OK, so this is going to give you an idea for that.

87
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:37.220
And we are going to learn a lot of cool new things in here in this project that I can't wait to get

88
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.350
in to see you guys in the next lecture.
