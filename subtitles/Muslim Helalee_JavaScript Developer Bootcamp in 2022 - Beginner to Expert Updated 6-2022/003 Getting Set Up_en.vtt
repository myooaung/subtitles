00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.160
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.170
In this lecture, we are going to go over the setup for this API.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.170
All right, so first off, go ahead and go to primum dot com, and from there, just click on the Saina

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.350
button, right when you click on the sign up button, just make sure you sign up for recipe search,

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.570
not for nutrition analysis.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.420
No, we are searching for recipes.

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.690
So click on the sign up button and you will come here.

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.130
Recipe API search.

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.900
And from there you can see that we have 5000 per month.

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.100
So if you use my app ID and app key, I actually don't mind it.

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.260
And but at some point you are going to get an error.

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.810
And the reason for that is because like if the same case, if multiple students, they use that and

13
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.720
you make like maybe like 100 calls per day, then you are going to get an error rate.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.370
So make sure you go over this set up.

15
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.240
It's simple.

16
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.110
Just click on start.

17
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.510
Now, you come here, you insert your information, username, email address, password, confirm password

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.100
for organization.

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.460
I literally provided whatever and it worked.

20
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.180
And just click here and this is going to be developer or I just just developer and don't touch this,

21
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.450
OK?

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.080
It's perfect.

23
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.060
Just click on the sign up and when you when you sign up then go ahead, go back to this website and

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.980
log in using your credentials and go.

25
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.770
And when you log in, just click on the dashboard, just go to your dashboard and from here from the

26
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.690
dashboard, I'm just going to close these three from the dashboard, go to applications.

27
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.180
You can see I've created three applications, one I worked with, the other two I was just testing how

28
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.030
how should I explain it to you so you can just click on create a new application?

29
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.490
And then go to Recipe Search API from there, I'm going to say food and I'm going to say whatever,

30
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.580
right and say create application and it is going to create an application.

31
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:27.450
This application has an application ID, which you need to grab it and come down here and say CONSED.

32
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.540
So we are doing second app I.D., app I.D. and I'm just going to put it right here.

33
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.780
I've created multiple so you can create multiple and then we have application key and I'm going to say

34
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.520
consed app key and put it right here.

35
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.400
Put it right here.

36
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.100
Perfect, so now that this is out of the way, what you're going to do is you're going to click on API

37
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.630
developer Parul, just click there and from there go to documentation to from the documentation, go

38
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.070
to recipe search.

39
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.090
Right recipe.

40
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.100
And now we are adding the documentation and enough of going backward and forward, all right.

41
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.540
So what I'm going to do here is we are going to go over the API and you can see that we are going to

42
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.950
be using this API Amazon.com search and we are going to provide our own query.

43
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.620
The query is going to come from right here where what the user inserts, for example, whatever the

44
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.030
user inserts and do, you can see that I'm just going to zoom in so you can really see we have some

45
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.950
parameters which are required.

46
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.910
And there are three.

47
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.480
We have our query which is required.

48
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.380
We have our app I.D., which we just got, which is required.

49
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.310
And the key is, yes, you can see that it's as required and it says yes, the rest of them are not

50
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.060
required.

51
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.620
You can go ahead and search.

52
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.210
This is a massive API.

53
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:11.750
It's it's like larger than the Guardian API that we talked about, larger than the convert to conversion

54
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.140
API.

55
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.550
Guardian EPA is also like it tremendously like huge API.

56
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.160
You have like a lot of options.

57
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.050
And I just scratched the surface.

58
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.520
You can, for example, for The Guardian, you search the news based on the category, based on the

59
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.100
year, based on different indices, like that's how big it is.

60
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.170
And this is also big.

61
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.340
You can grab you can search for you can become really, really, really specific in your search.

62
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.180
Right.

63
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.780
And so what we are going to do is we are going to keep it simple and we want to just get running as

64
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.830
fast as possible.

65
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.930
I'm going to use this, too, as well.

66
00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.230
And it is going to give us the number of results that we are going to get so you can get it, for example,

67
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.200
unit to unit to get it from ten plus plus 10.

68
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.090
So I just set it to 30.

69
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.600
I think we could do 300, 3000.

70
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.340
I don't know.

71
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.500
So let's see, let's let me do 3000 here.

72
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.950
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to I just saved it and it is 3000.

73
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.930
You just saw it.

74
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.660
It was saved.

75
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.900
C saved.

76
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.790
So let's do solid.

77
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.090
Do we get 3000 results?

78
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.950
It should take a while.

79
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.750
Or we should I don't think we should we can come here.

80
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:43.470
Its status of 400 and 400, cos they are can be for each of undefined recipe.

81
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.240
This comes from my own application 31.

82
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.070
And where is thirty one recipe results?

83
00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.980
Oh, it's the reason, hmm, uh, cannot read property for each of undefined.

84
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.470
Why is it undefined?

85
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.250
Search results.

86
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:16.410
Recipe that heads, I think it's because it has it is 3000, so I'm just going to make it 300 and I'm

87
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:24.900
going to say salad and we get the same error, 400 if I make it 30 and save it and come here.

88
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.650
Salad.

89
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.910
And now we don't get another, so we cannot go above 30, c, 30.

90
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.470
That's why I threw an arrow there.

91
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.090
So example to 30, I think we should be able to get more than that.

92
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.670
But anyway, so there is a lot of things that we should go over.

93
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.190
But I'm just going to go over this syntax so you can see this is our URL.

94
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.700
This is going to be our query.

95
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.870
For example, can our app idea is going to come right here.

96
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.530
Our application key is going to come right here and the rest of the filters we are not going to need.

97
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:07.750
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to grab it up until search and I'm going to put it const.

98
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.780
Um hmm.

99
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.670
Should I call it recipe?

100
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.880
You are Al.

101
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.370
Pasted right here, right, and don't forget the question mark, because I think there is a question

102
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.620
mark and then we have our query and then we are going to add that query.

103
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.670
So I'm going to say Q equals.

104
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.730
And then after that, we are going to add our query.

105
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.410
All right.

106
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.940
So this is the documentation.

107
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.330
You can go over that in more detail.

108
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.940
For example, we are going to get a label.

109
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:49.560
We are going to get you are all we are going to get image calories, health labels, diet labels.

110
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.300
This we are going to grab this label, this one and.

111
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.240
Hmm.

112
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.190
And I think that's it.

113
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:04.040
So I'm going to give you some time to go ahead and to get set up with the application.

114
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:13.040
And in the next lecture, we are going to go over the how we can make this UI dynamic and to be able

115
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.010
to fetch data so-called on the fly.

116
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.700
All right.

117
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.000
So that's it for this lecture.

118
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.730
See you guys in the next one.
