00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,070
Hi, everyone, in this that we are going to implement a note playing function for our piano on.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:15,420
All right, so first things first, let's go ahead and let's grab the elements that we want to work

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,590
with.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,050
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all of our keys by their shared class, which is the key.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,550
So this key is shared among all of our key elements.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,610
So I'm just going to go ahead and grab them by that first.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,340
So we are going to say query selector.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,340
All the reason for that is there are more than one.

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,240
And then after that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the Black Keys and I'm going to say

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,240
document.

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,330
Not do not track document that query selector.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,170
And we are going to say dot, dot, block.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,820
Now, the reason that I've done this and there is no space is because space is a descendant selector

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,280
and whenever you use a descendant selector, it means that the following clause, which in this case

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,290
is Bluck, is a child of the key clause.

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,600
But that is not true.

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,620
The block is not a child.

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,330
Both of those classes, they belong to the same element.

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,260
So in that case, you should not provide a space there.

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,430
All right.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,470
So I'm just going to say, can't you know what?

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,890
I'm just going to copy this for here.

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,130
And we are going to grab the block key word and we are going to say control and replace it with the

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,550
white.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,790
So now we have successfully grabbed this now before going forward.

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,060
I'm just going to go ahead and cancel that log.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
Our kids, because I want to see what is that?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,490
Come on, Soledad, look, I just want to see our kids what this is going to return in the world of

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,190
JavaScript, so let's go ahead and open and inspect.

30
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,250
And when we come here, we see that we have 12 items.

31
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,420
The index starts from zero, and we end up with what we end up with a node list.

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,430
So we have returned successfully in node list.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,270
All right.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,530
So this is going to give us a novelist with a lot of methods and properties that we can apply.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,400
Basically, this is how JavaScript works.

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,150
You select something through the selectors.

37
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,580
It doesn't matter whether it's query selector or document that get element by something.

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,430
Whatever the selector is, as long as you select that.

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,060
All right.

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:38,790
And then you can consider log it see in the console what what it what it entails, what it what it consists

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,300
of.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,210
Very difficult sentence, believe me.

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,330
And then according to that, you perform some sort of operation.

44
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,360
So basically, this is how Dom works in JavaScript.

45
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,010
And these are the things that mostly we are we are doing whenever we are making our websites too dynamic.

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,960
So in here, so there are two ways of playing this piano.

47
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,190
The first way is like clicking and the second way is like pressing keys.

48
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,430
So I want to implement functionality for this piano in both of the ways.

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,080
So first off, let's go ahead and let's take care of the clicking.

50
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,930
So for clicking, we are going to use an event listener and we are going to listen for a click because

51
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,940
there are more than one element element or more than one key.

52
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,250
We need some sort of loop to loop over these keys.

53
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,750
And the most popular is for each and whenever the each runs.

54
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,950
So what I'm going to do, I'm just going to go back and come here now.

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:45,470
And here it says performs the specified action for each node in a list and then in a list.

56
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,010
Right.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,890
So this is going to perform like an action for a specified number.

58
00:03:52,070 --> 00:04:00,110
So depending on which one, which constant or on which variable you apply for each day for each action

59
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,740
is going to be changed because now we have a node list.

60
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,490
And but in here it says an array because this is inside here it works like an array.

61
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:15,680
But if I remove that and if I click because the keys was a node less, that is going to perform an action

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,209
on a node in a list.

63
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,250
Right.

64
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,040
So in here we are going to run a function provided with a parameter of key and this is going to be the

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,310
loop variable as well.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,450
We are going to grab the key and we are going to say add event listener.

67
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,990
The event, the Intellisense doesn't work because this is misspelled.

68
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:46,010
All right, so it is an event listener, and this is another quick way of knowing whether you have misspelled

69
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,800
something or not.

70
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,000
And whenever we click, we are going to run a function.

71
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,860
Now, in here, we could write the function itself and we could also use our error function.

72
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,160
So I can just go ahead and do this.

73
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,410
And this is going to work as well.

74
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:09,260
So here we are going to run a function which is called plane note and we are going to pass in the parameter.

75
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,850
All right.

76
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,760
So now we have not created this plane out function.

77
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,400
So we are going to create this plane out function.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,830
And the the parameter is going to be key in here.

79
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,340
We have passed this for each variable as an argument to this plane out function.

80
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:35,900
So now whenever this any of these keys is collect this function, this plane load function is going

81
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,290
to run.

82
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,440
So what do we want to run inside this plane of function?

83
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,150
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to call it note

84
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,740
audio.

85
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,730
You and I'm going to say it should be document now in here, I'm going to use our get element by idea

86
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,230
that get aliment by IED.

87
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,260
And now what we are going to do is we are going to grab the IEDs for these ideas.

88
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,050
So what are we going to do is I'm going to say grab these IEDs dynamically.

89
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,920
I do not want to grab this seat and I'm going to take a moment here and I'm going to explain this,

90
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,670
why this is going to happen and why we should do it this way.

91
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:26,860
Because if I just go ahead and if I grabbed the IED for, let's say, the cenote, then it doesn't matter

92
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,390
what the user process.

93
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,030
The user is always going to hear this cenote sound all right.

94
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,440
But we don't want that.

95
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:44,830
We want whenever the user clicks on any these corresponding keys, we want to be able to hear the sound

96
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,190
for that for that specific key which has been pressed.

97
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,700
We do not want to hear one sound for all of the keys that are being pressed.

98
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,010
That's why we are going to grab the IED dynamically.

99
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,990
And in here I'm going to pass in key and inside the key, we are going to grab the data set, which

100
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,310
is a property.

101
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:06,940
Right.

102
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,250
And from there, we're going to grab the note.

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,250
All right, let's save it, so let's go ahead and let's consider log this step by step so we can understand

104
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,320
what we have done.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,930
So first off, let's go ahead and let's consider log the key.

106
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,840
So I'm going to zoom out because this piano is quite large.

107
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,200
So it doesn't matter if I if I'm zooming zoomed in or not because I need this console to be open.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,770
So if I click on any key, this event is going to be fired and this event for this event is going to

109
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,510
call this playing out function.

110
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,510
And this plan planet function is going to be called.

111
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,700
And this plan would function is going to only implement this concept, the lock.

112
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,690
So click on it.

113
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,940
We are going to see this.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,430
The C note has been clicked.

115
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,870
This is the C because this is the first key in here.

116
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,690
All right.

117
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,210
So if I click on this, which we get D, then click on this, we get E, so each time I click on any

118
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,120
of these, we are going to get a different key.

119
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,790
And this is exactly what we have done.

120
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,520
This is exactly what we want to do.

121
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,300
All right.

122
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,930
This is exactly what we want to do in here.

123
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,350
Whenever the user clicks on any of these keys, we want to grab that key and we want to play the audio.

124
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,010
Associated with that key, this is going to be it for this lecture, we are going to pick up where we

125
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,789
left off in the next lecture.

126
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,860
See you guys then.
