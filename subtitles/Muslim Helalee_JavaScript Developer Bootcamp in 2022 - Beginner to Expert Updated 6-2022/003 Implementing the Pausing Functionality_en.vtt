00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.430
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to implement the pausing functionality.

2
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.650
All right, so before diving into that, let's go ahead and let's fix this issue that we had whenever

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.450
we claim it does read it.

4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.100
But the problem is the screen is still disabled, so we cannot write anything else until we refresh,

5
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.140
which is not a good user experience.

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.820
All right.

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.290
So what I'm going to do is there are whenever you specify the speech synthesis speech, and that is

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.070
this is very difficult for me to pronounce whenever we define is speech and that is utterance.

9
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.560
I told you guys that there are a set of methods and properties that are made available to us, but also

10
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.460
there are a set of events that are also available that are also made available to us.

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.090
One of those events is called an end event.

12
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.030
So we are going to grab our audience and we are going to call an event listener.

13
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.879
The event is going to be Ent..

14
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.300
All right.

15
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.980
And it says appends an event listener for events who step up attribute values type, whereas the event

16
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.550
and.

17
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.960
And target event, basically what it does is whenever the odorants and it is going to do something for

18
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.300
us, so whenever the utterance ends, it is going to implement this function.

19
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:38.130
And this function is basically going to say text display, dot disabled, disabled, equal to force.

20
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.280
That's it.

21
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.480
That's it.

22
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.930
So let's go ahead and let's paste it.

23
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.070
Click on it.

24
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.050
Fox jumps over the lazy dog.

25
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.470
And there we go, the screen just unlocked right now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead

26
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.150
and create the pausing functionality.

27
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.730
Functionality.

28
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.690
All right, so first off, we need to create the event listener refer to that.

29
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.910
So the event is going to be a on the pause button that we have already selected that add event listener.

30
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860
What is the event, these events?

31
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.680
They're simple.

32
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.810
They're just and a click event.

33
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.720
And when when the event happens, we want to run a function.

34
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.000
But this function is in here.

35
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.950
We will be running a function call.

36
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.120
The function is going to be defined separately.

37
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.570
Right.

38
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.560
Or standalone.

39
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.540
And you're going to say pause.

40
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:49.090
Pause text, so first one is read text, the second one is pause, text, or I think if we set it to

41
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.080
pause, read, pause, reading, I think this is better known.

42
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.780
The text makes more sense.

43
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.520
So let's put it to pause text.

44
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.400
All right.

45
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.630
Now, let's go ahead and let's create this function down below and in here.

46
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.930
I'm going to say parsing or.

47
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.710
Pause, text function.

48
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.180
All right, so they're going to say function, the function name is already defined, they're going

49
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.970
to say pause, text and as a.

50
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.610
Parameter, we're not going to insert anything, we're going to say f f now this is an F statement and

51
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.690
what is it exactly that we want to do here?

52
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.290
Let's take three seconds to talk about it.

53
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.330
We want whenever the computer is speaking, whenever the computer is speaking, to parse that, speak

54
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
wherever that is OK.

55
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.490
And whenever the user clicks again on the red button, which is something that we will do at the end

56
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.870
of this video, we want to resume resume from that, like from that space.

57
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.070
We want to resume from that.

58
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.110
So if if the computer is speaking, pause it.

59
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.000
If the computer is not speaking, don't do anything.

60
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.710
That's it.

61
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.010
That's why we are going to provide enough space.

62
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.519
So we say if speech centered synthesis of speech synthesis is speaking, do what?

63
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.780
Just grab the speech synthesis and just call the pause method.

64
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.640
That said, this is how simple it is that set.

65
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.950
So we just say just just go ahead and pause it.

66
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.760
So go ahead.

67
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.720
Let's grab our very long text.

68
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.910
Let's put it right here.

69
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.030
Like in the distant future, let's click pause.

70
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.810
Which it does pass this click read.

71
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.270
It doesn't read again as clocks stop.

72
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.490
Nothing works, so it pauses that the reading of the text.

73
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.730
But that said, and that is not something that we want.

74
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.510
So whenever the text is paused, we want to read.

75
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.010
We want whenever we collect, we want to be able to read it again.

76
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.890
So for that to happen, what I'm going to do is we we need to go to a read text and we need to resume

77
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.940
our text once more.

78
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:22.020
So let's go ahead and let's say if the speech Santarus is paused or the text is paused and the text

79
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.350
is speaking, we want to resume it at that point whenever the read text is called.

80
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.940
So what does that mean?

81
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.070
Let's go ahead and authorize FCP.

82
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.740
Santarus is passed.

83
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.880
We are going to use a logical and operator and speech and that is speaking in both of these cases.

84
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.850
We just want to return, keep in mind, return nothing after this return is going to run.

85
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.050
If this condition is true, nothing is going to run.

86
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.970
We want to return speech centers that resume now whenever you use speech.

87
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.500
And that is an utterance.

88
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.870
All these methods and properties that are made available to.

89
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.840
What does this mean?

90
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.060
It means that when the speech is synthetics, when the speech is paused, resume it.

91
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.880
And when the speech is speaking, just resume.

92
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.500
So whenever you go ahead and you, for example, you pay something here, did we save it?

93
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.100
Now, when you click on Read, just click on read.

94
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.640
Come on, buddy.

95
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.670
So, Fred.

96
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.690
It doesn't read.

97
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.780
So speech Santarus.

98
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.470
O kay.

99
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.020
All right, so let's try it again, I think everything is here.

100
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.800
Set in the distant future amidst a futile interstellar.

101
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.830
Society in which various noble.

102
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.320
Houses here.

103
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.970
It looks fine, but you know what, I'm just going to go ahead and open it with life server one more

104
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.350
time.

105
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.350
I think we lost the connection there or something.

106
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.860
So let's go to inspect console in there and scrub our assurer text that we had.

107
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.820
Let's put it here.

108
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.460
The quick brown box jobs.

109
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.490
Over the lazy dog.

110
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:28.390
OK, it works fine, so now we have successfully implemented the pausing functionality and also whenever

111
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.690
the speech center is paused or is speaking, we just want to resume it from that place.

112
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.220
There is one more thing that I want to do here, and that is whenever you double click or anything,

113
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:46.780
when you when the speech is being spoken, whenever you click double click on the start or on the read

114
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.480
button, I don't want it to do something weird.

115
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:57.100
So I'm just going to go ahead and say speech santhara dot speaking, if it is speaking, just returned,

116
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.260
do not run this function.

117
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:05.170
So I'm just going to commented out and I'm going to hopefully be able to show you what I mean over the

118
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.860
lazy dog.

119
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.320
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

120
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:16.480
The quick brown, this is the problem, right, because even though the screen is disabled, it is still

121
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.760
speaking because I clicked on the read button for multiple times, OK?

122
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.330
And it was reading and I just clicked on it once more.

123
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.560
And it is still reading even though the screen is not locked.

124
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.400
Right.

125
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.210
So if I just paste it and double and click on the read and click again and it should read it out loud

126
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:37.659
twice.

127
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:45.460
See, this is the problem with whenever you're speaking, sir, whenever the computer is speaking,

128
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.410
we do not want to do anything else.

129
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.380
We do not want to like be able to double click the user, to be able to double click and to play it

130
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.420
once more even after the speech is done.

131
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.000
Done right, so let's just click roadblocks, jumps over the lazy dog.

132
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:12.240
That's it, so it doesn't matter how many times I click, it is just going to read it once after it

133
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.990
is done and is going to read it again.

134
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.370
This is going to be it for this lecture.

135
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.010
See you guys in the next one.
