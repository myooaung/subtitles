1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,930
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will draw the ball.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:15,320
All right, so first off, I'm going to go to the new game function and I'm going to call that ball

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,850
variable that we have declared on top.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,790
Where is it?

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,580
Right here, I'm just going to call that in here, because Ball is going to be a constructor as well.

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,880
So we are going to say new ball and we are going to pass and the ball.

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,790
What that is going to be, we are going to see that in a minute and we are going to pass him the ball

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,540
speed as well.

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,700
So next stop, let's go ahead and let's create the class.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:01:00,570
So on on top of the panel, I'm going to come here and I'm going to say the ball class and I'm going

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,400
to say class ball.

12
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,060
Let's give it a constructor.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,670
So the constructor is going to have two parameters.

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,340
The first parameter is going to be the ball size.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,780
So that wall that we've passed up there was actually the ball size that we have and we have the ball

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,590
speed.

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,040
Perfect.

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,080
So first off, let's define the width of the ball.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,990
The width of the ball is going to be ball size.

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,220
As with the height of the ball, we are going to go to the X position of the ball.

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,080
What is the exposition?

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,090
The exposition.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,650
Now, keep in mind that the exposition of the ball and the exposition of the paddle is going to be the

24
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,190
same because we wanted to start from there.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,430
So paddle that x the Y position, it should be on top of the paddle.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,370
So we need to subtracted from half of the paddle.

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,820
So this start why we are going to have our paddles y position minus.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:11,380
Let's subtract the paddles height half of that and let's also subtract the ball's height, the start

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,330
half of that.

30
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,900
Perfect, so divided by two.

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:28,390
There we go, this start speed is going to be equal to the ball speed, which is a fraction, and we

32
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:35,620
are going to multiply it by the height because the ball speed is going to be dependent on the height,

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,580
right.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:46,150
So this should be capital perfect then we have our now because the ball is moving in both directions,

35
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,520
we are going to have X velocity zero.

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,250
And we are going to have y velocity 00, so this is created, we don't have any errors.

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,870
Perfect.

38
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,930
So now.

39
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,090
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to our new game function, right?

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:19,130
Where is our new game function right here and let's see underneath this, I'm going to call in a function

41
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,270
called drawable.

42
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,070
I'm not going to save it because we have not actually created this function yet.

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,940
So let's go ahead and let's actually created right here.

44
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,060
Right.

45
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,980
So I'm going to.

46
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,840
We know we have called it the drop ball function, so I'm going to grab that comment, put it right

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
here and I'm going to say BA.

48
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:49,240
And we are going to say drop the ball function, it is not going to grab any parameters, we just want

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,110
to draw a ball.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:04:00,310
So the Conex start, a field style is going to be Phil style is going to be the color of the ball that

51
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,110
we have specified on top.

52
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,270
Then the.

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,790
Then we are going to call in the film Recht, because basically we are, we are we want to draw a rectangle.

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:21,690
The exposition of the ball is going to be ball dot x minus the ball dot with divided by two.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
And the Y position is going to be it's going to act in the same way.

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,710
So baldest Y minus bolds height divided by two.

57
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,030
We want half of the ball to be on one side and half on the other side.

58
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,800
That's Y and half on the top.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
Half on the bottom.

60
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,890
We want to grab that exact point.

61
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,680
The width of the ball is going to be the ball with and the height of the ball is going to be double

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,180
height.

63
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,670
So let's say that.

64
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,550
Let's come here.

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,190
There we go.

66
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,510
This is where our ball is now.

67
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,910
The problem is if you move our paddle, the ball is stationary.

68
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,230
So far, we're going to get to actually moving the paddle with the ball, moving the ball with the paddle

69
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,650
as well.

70
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,050
So for now, the ball is stationary there.

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,360
OK, so the next thing that I want to do is I want to update the position of the ball with the velocity

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,320
that it might have.

73
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,210
And what I want to do is I want to let's come here.

74
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,580
First off, I'm going to come into our update functions.

75
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,690
And right after the update, Padel, I'm going to I'm going to call a function called Update Voll and

76
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,820
we are going to create this function.

77
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,420
So let's come down, where is our update, Per?

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,650
Where have we specified the update panel?

79
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,810
So this is our update panel.

80
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,760
So on top of the update panel, I'm going to create our update function.

81
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:06,100
Of date ball, perfect, so let's create that function of date ball.

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,450
No parameters and what do we want to do here, basically?

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,130
So in the update bar, what we are going to do is we are going to grab the exposition and we are going

84
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,470
to add on to it the ball's, what, X velocity?

85
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:33,780
But we're going to divide it by 1000 to get a second, actually, to get a second and then get a pixels

86
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,770
per frame after that.

87
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,730
So I'm going to multiply it by 15 and we are going to do the same thing for the Y position.

88
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,740
So multiply it by the Y.

89
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,790
Save it.

90
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,920
It is not moving, it should move.

91
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,050
Is there any typo we have done here?

92
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,090
We have called the update all the way velocity.

93
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,190
Oh, where is the speed we should increment?

94
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,080
This should add the speed as well, because the velocities are zero for now.

95
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,490
All right, so, uh, hmm.

96
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,110
All right, so whenever the game starts, we don't want to whenever we refresh, we don't want to move

97
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,160
the ball, you can see.

98
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,950
But when we had the space bar, then we want to move the ball.

99
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,670
So what we're going to do is I'm going to go to my key down where is the key down function.

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,810
So this is the key down function and I'm in here.

101
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,700
I'm going to create another case and that is going to be for the space.

102
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,360
You can't change it to any other key that you want, but I'm just going to go with the space.

103
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,030
So the key code for that is 32 and that is space key.

104
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,730
And we are going to call it to serve the ball.

105
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,160
Perfect.

106
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,550
So in here, what do I want to do?

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I want to call a serve ball function.

108
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,080
Very simple, I just want to call a serve ball function.

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:17,470
So now what should we do as we should go ahead and we should create the serve all function and.

110
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,230
Hmm, where should we put it?

111
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,930
Right here.

112
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm just going to go on top of the set dimensions and in here I'm going to create a function that is

113
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,540
going to be served.

114
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,790
All right.

115
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:36,940
So first off, we need to check if the ball is still not moving, if the ball is is moving.

116
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,340
So first off, let's create the function, serve ball.

117
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,960
So if the ball is currently moving, we do not want to serve it again and again and again.

118
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:53,770
So if the ball once the user hits the space, doesn't matter how many more times the user is going to

119
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,070
head the ball is just going to be served once.

120
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,470
Why why should we care about this?

121
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,230
Because each time the user serves the ball, the angle of the ball is going to be different.

122
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,200
Now keep this and take a look at this one.

123
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,450
So I'm just going to reload the page if I had it.

124
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,320
You can see it goes to.

125
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,740
Right.

126
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,690
Reload the page, hit it again.

127
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,700
It goes to top reload the page.

128
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,600
It goes to the left.

129
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,110
So each time I serve the ball, the ball is going to have a different bounce angle.

130
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,970
And if we do not check for this condition when the ball is moving towards the the bricks, the user

131
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,890
hits by mistake space, then the ball is going to deflect midway.

132
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,480
And that's not what we want.

133
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,760
Right.

134
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,500
So first off, if.

135
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:52,780
If the ball ball is already moving, do not do not serve.

136
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Do not allow, serve, serve.

137
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:06,090
OK, so we are going to say f ball dot y velocity is not equal to.

138
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,840
Is not equal to zero.

139
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,990
We just want to return false.

140
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,660
It means we are returning from this function.

141
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,810
We do not want to run anything now.

142
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:26,660
What we are going to do is we are going to grab a random angle and we do not that we do not want that

143
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:37,670
random angle to win, not less than the minimum bounce angle, which we are going to specify.

144
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:46,760
In just a moment, so first things first, let's go ahead and let's zoom in bounds, and I'm not talking

145
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,480
about this one.

146
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,070
I'm talking about this.

147
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:59,270
So we have a we are going to have a variable that is going to be in bounds and risk for angle and then

148
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,230
bounce angle.

149
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:08,450
And when we divide it by 180 and then multiply it because we want to grab degrees, we don't want to

150
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,420
we have degrees so far.

151
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,750
Right.

152
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:19,130
So whenever the ball is moving to the left, the common sense is that we say, for example, 30 degrees,

153
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,870
40 degrees.

154
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
So in our mind, we have degrees.

155
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,890
What do we want to do is we want to change it to radians so we can apply sine and cosine to it, so

156
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:34,610
we can say math, dot pi and this is going to return for us radians.

157
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,250
In just a moment, this is all going to make sense.

158
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,160
Let's put it there.

159
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,810
There we go.

160
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,150
And let's specify a range for that as well.

161
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,400
So what is going to be the minimum and the maximum range for that?

162
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:58,320
So for the for the range is going to be math that pie minus the minimum balance angle that we that we

163
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,060
have times to and the angle itself.

164
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,270
It's going to be a random angle, so we are going to say math are random, divided by the range that

165
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,890
we have, plus the minimum bouncing.

166
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,610
So let's say that the range angle is going to give us, for example, the range angle is going to give

167
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,680
us 50 degrees.

168
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:31,760
And here we have math that random multiplied by 50, let's say that match their random returns one and

169
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,390
one times 50 degrees is going to be 50 degrees, plus the minimum bounce angle.

170
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,850
The minimum bounce angle is going to be 30 to 150.

171
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,190
So 50 degrees plus three degrees is going to be our angle.

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,420
Right.

173
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:57,380
And in here, I'm just going to call a function and that is apply speed of light, ball, speed, ball

174
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,090
speed.

175
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,220
This is the function that is going to take care of the ball speed and we are going to pass and the angle

176
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,580
there.

177
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:07,980
Perfect.

178
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,030
So what we are going to do next is we are going to create this a fly ball speed function.

179
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:24,350
So I'm going to come down here and let's grab this comment and put it right here, a fly ball and speed

180
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,070
function.

181
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:36,240
Fly ball, speed function, apply ball speed, and we are going to pass and the the parameter as well,

182
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,360
so what it is that we want to do here for the X velocity, we are going to use the cosine because the

183
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,010
cosine is the adjacent of that triangle.

184
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,830
If the triangle and for this Y velocity, we are going to get the same.

185
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,950
But because for the Y velocity.

186
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,170
So first off, let's do the X and then let's talk about the way we're going to grab the ball speed.

187
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:10,090
You can see that we are setting the ball speed to the X velocity, but times the math dot cosine math

188
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,520
that cosine of the angle that we have passed.

189
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,730
And for this it is going to be math that sine because it is moving upwards, because it is moving upwards,

190
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,830
it is moving in the negative direction, we are going negative.

191
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,520
And you're going to add YV there.

192
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,150
So let's press the space.

193
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,680
It doesn't work yet.

194
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:45,300
All right, so I think the the problem is going to be this cosign, so this was con, but it should

195
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,860
be co-sign and we have not specified this minimum balance angle.

196
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,060
She should go to the top and let's say CONSED.

197
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,310
Let's specify that as well.

198
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,700
So I'm going to call it we have already called this minimum bounce angle and the minimum bounce angle

199
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,770
is going to be 30 degrees.

200
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,480
Right.

201
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,390
And I'm just going to put in a comment as well here.

202
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,160
All right, let's grab it.

203
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,990
Let's put it there.

204
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,110
So the minimum bounce angle from the horizontal in degrees.

205
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,540
Perfect.

206
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,960
So let's save it.

207
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,330
Let's come here and let's press space.

208
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,150
There we go.

209
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,210
So the ball moves in the in the 30 degrees.

210
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,220
Doesn't matter.

211
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,220
Now you can see that the minimum the minimum is 30.

212
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,760
It could go greater than that.

213
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,920
But the problem is that why is that when I had space, why is this space is moving?

214
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,810
So why is this panel is being moved?

215
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,450
This paddle is constantly being moved to left.

216
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,230
And if I were to guess, is there we did not break out of that case.

217
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,950
That is my guess, that we did not break out of it.

218
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,510
There we go.

219
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,580
We should break out of it.

220
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,330
If we do not break out of that, you can see that this is running as well.

221
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,860
And then we have the break.

222
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,330
That's why this is not running.

223
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,250
So let's save it.

224
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,610
Let's see.

225
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,400
So the ball is being served when we press space each time it is going to have a different direction,

226
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,540
a different angle.

227
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,000
The next logical thing for us to do is going to be the implementing the collision detection.

228
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:33,100
Or bouncing the ball off the of the walls, so that is going to be the first thing that we will be doing.

229
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,480
All right.

230
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:43,190
So I would like to do that in this lecture as well, so just to keep the continuity going, so inside

231
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,490
the in here I'm going to say move the ball.

232
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,320
Right.

233
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,920
So that is going to be.

234
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:01,520
For moving the ball next, let's go ahead and let's come down here so we have two different kinds of

235
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,660
collision detection.

236
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,650
The first coning two is going to be bouncing it off from the wall.

237
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:14,060
The second kind is actually bouncing it off from the from the paddle.

238
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:21,200
But what I am going to do is I'm going to bounce it off the wall first and then we are going to bounce

239
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,599
it off the paddle.

240
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,369
So in here, I'm going to say bouncing.

241
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,630
The ball.

242
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:39,370
Off the walls, so we need to detect when the ball hits the part of the wall.

243
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,080
So we are going to say if the first we are going to go with the left direction.

244
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,900
So if the ball's X is less than the walls with by a half its width.

245
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,090
Divided by two.

246
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,320
And what what do we want to do?

247
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:08,250
Now we want to we want to do two things first, we want to reposition the ball so it would not go beyond

248
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,700
that.

249
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:15,240
And the second thing that we want to do is we want to reverse the velocity so it bounces off to another

250
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,850
direction.

251
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,440
First, we want to stop it there and then and then bounce it off to another side.

252
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:30,750
So we are going to grab the ball V and we are going to say minus that X V, perfect.

253
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,610
So we are going to have a lot of like a couple of more conditions here as well.

254
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,650
But now first, let's go ahead and let's see if we can.

255
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,660
But it doesn't go first.

256
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,900
It was for the left.

257
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,880
So there we go.

258
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,390
So we have successfully implemented that.

259
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,700
I'm going to do it one more time.

260
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,970
It should bounce off the wall.

261
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,040
There we go.

262
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,100
It bounces off the wall on the left wall.

263
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,990
Let's go ahead and apply it for the left, for the right one.

264
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:06,420
So we are going to say, al-Assaf, if the balls it's sort of like the paddle that we had greater than

265
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,910
the canvas elements with.

266
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:24,230
All right, and the with minus the wall, minus the bulls, half of the balls with so ball, that width

267
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,320
divided by two, what it is that we want to do, we want to first reposition the ball.

268
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,670
So let's put it there and let's set it to equal.

269
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,380
And then we are going to grab the balls x velocity and reverse that velocity.

270
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,310
So you should get it to bounce off that wall as well.

271
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,380
So I'm just going to reload the page so we get it.

272
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,240
We get a good angle there.

273
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,610
No, no, no.

274
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,200
There we go.

275
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:06,020
Oh, so we have it says uncaught x V is not defined to 177.

276
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,180
So let's see that XIV.

277
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:19,710
This is one seventy seven, why is not we just used it right here, so it's the same thing we say that

278
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:30,600
if the balls exposition is greater than the canvas with minus the wall, minus the balls with time divided

279
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,620
by two, we want to reposition the ball as exposition to their right.

280
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,560
And you know what?

281
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,190
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go to the top.

282
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,620
This is still one seventy seven and is going to be uncaught.

283
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,810
Reference error is not defined ls.

284
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,620
If the world's exposition is greater than the canvas is with minus that elusive.

285
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,420
If that is the case.

286
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,060
We want to everything seems to be working fine.

287
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,790
Why do we have that?

288
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,040
So if I comment that one out and if I just do a console log, let's see.

289
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,100
Right it.

290
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,270
Let's put it there and let's clear that.

291
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,010
Why do we get that?

292
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,380
Still 177 words.

293
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,440
One, it's right here.

294
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,700
So I have removed it.

295
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,910
I'm just going to open it up.

296
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,360
With life server one more time, this is the thing with the game loop, if you do one mistake, it is

297
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
going to repeat it over and over and over again.

298
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,690
So now there is nothing.

299
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,860
So let's reload the page.

300
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,440
Perfect.

301
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,720
That's.

302
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,330
So it bounces off perfectly fine and.

303
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:02,840
Right, hit, so it does head it and you can see that we have grabbed the position and the position,

304
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,200
you saw how it was sliding against that, against the wall.

305
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,130
So this is how this should work.

306
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,380
If I copy it from there, even though they're identical, let's put it here.

307
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,450
I don't know why it's not accepting it.

308
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,120
It should.

309
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,000
What is the problem?

310
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,430
So let's reload the page.

311
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,880
There we go.

312
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:36,920
So maybe that was a bug or something, but it works now, so it bounces off the left, it bounces hmmm.

313
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,550
It should bounce off the right.

314
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,300
Right.

315
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,340
There we go.

316
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,910
When it hits, it is going to print that right hit.

317
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,420
So let's remove that.

318
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,500
I don't know, maybe there was something that I did wrong here.

319
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:56,620
Oh, it was of course, I'm sorry for this, we should put on the board that XIV.

320
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,770
Yeah, it was my mistake, it wasn't a bug.

321
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,320
It was a bug in me, of course.

322
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:10,750
There we go, should bounce off, so now that we have done that, why shouldn't we go ahead and implement

323
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,430
the same thing for the top so we can see that our Ballot Bowl is truly bouncy?

324
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:26,310
So if the balls y position is less than the ball, so the left and top are going to be the same almost

325
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,330
and the right and bottom are going to be almost the same.

326
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:36,910
So we are going to grab the war bonds height divided by two, and we want to reposition it to that.

327
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:49,470
And we also want to grab the wave of the lost city this time, and we want to change the direction of

328
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,580
the velocity.

329
00:23:52,180 --> 00:24:02,170
OK, so our balls should bounce perfectly fine, so bounce, bounce, it comes down and even if I move

330
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,540
this panel, it is not going to the panel is not going to grab it.

331
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,390
It didn't grab it.

332
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:19,920
Perfect, so we should how about if we implement the bounce from the paddle as well, so I'm going to

333
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:27,960
come on down here because that is going to be the continuity of this lecture, bouncing the ball of

334
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,430
the paddle.

335
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,050
If you are feeling like this is a lot, you can pause the video and take a break.

336
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,990
That is the good thing about these online videos that you can pause it, you can rewind it, you can

337
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,000
go back, you can go forward.

338
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,170
You can do whatever you want that fits your needs.

339
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,650
Right.

340
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,600
That fits you better.

341
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:55,350
So and here we are going to say that now we need to account for all sides of the ball.

342
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,110
So we are going to get the ball, stop the ball bottom the balls left and the balls right.

343
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:14,610
So first off, if the balls y is greater than the paddles y, but we need to reduce to subtract the

344
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,720
height of the paddle.

345
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:27,850
Paddle tight times, point five or a half of the height, minus the ball, half of the height of the

346
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:35,860
ball, so half of that if this is the case and but but I'm not going to write the end there.

347
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,470
I'm just going to pass into the end here.

348
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:48,320
So and the ball's so that was the top of the game.

349
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,070
The actually the top of the paddle and the bottom of the ball.

350
00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:00,130
Now we should do the bat, the bottom of the ball, the top of the ball as well.

351
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,090
Right.

352
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,000
So we are going to say that Y is less than the paddles y paddle.

353
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:19,920
Dout, why is why, plus the panel's height, plus the Pardo's height times times zero point five,

354
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:20,970
let's say.

355
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,000
Let's see how the code is going to rearrange that.

356
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,110
So the viscardi ranges like that, which is perfectly fine.

357
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,050
So we are going to go to the next slide.

358
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,890
Now, let's do the same thing for the X, so for the X and for the Y, for the for the both sides of

359
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,190
the X.

360
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,010
I'm just going to copy that, sir.

361
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,700
Remove this.

362
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,320
Let's change all the whys to access this.

363
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,500
Change all the heights to withs.

364
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:58,260
And we say that if the ball's exposition is less than the paddles exposition, minus the paddles half

365
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,610
of the paddle with within half of the balls with and if the.

366
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:14,600
Bozz Exposition is less than the paddles time, plus the half of the paddles with plus half of the paddles

367
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,550
after half of the balls with as well, then what do we want to do?

368
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:26,320
We are going to grab this first condition and basically we want to reposition it to this first condition.

369
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,660
Let's save it, let's put it right here, and so let's put in the equality side.

370
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:46,450
Right here, so we just change the paddles, the balls y position to the paddles y position, minus

371
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,730
the half of the paddles height minus half of the balls height, perfect.

372
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:59,240
And when that happens, when we reposition it, we want to change the velocity direction as well.

373
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:05,620
So we are going to say negative ball that YV.

374
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,780
Perfect, so let's save it.

375
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,270
But before actually going there, what I want to do is I want to come back to my bouncing the ball and

376
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,890
I want to hear I want to call a function that is spin ball.

377
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:26,920
And this function is going to be responsible for that deflection of the ball that we will have.

378
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,840
So I'm going to put it right here and I'm going to grab it and I'm going to put it in all these three

379
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,530
cases.

380
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,260
All right.

381
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:43,670
And hmm, and OK, so also I'm going to you know what?

382
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,010
I'm just going to first stuff coming this one out, because this is going to throw a lot of errors.

383
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,540
Let's first off check if it is going to bounce off, then we are going to do the rest of that.

384
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,440
So bounce off.

385
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,240
Bounce off.

386
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,240
Come on.

387
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,180
There we go.

388
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,540
So it does bounce off.

389
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,930
And then we can see this is a cool game that you can play.

390
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,470
And but this is not the game that we are going to build here.

391
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,110
So the some of the functionality of the game is being is done, is being completed.

392
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,760
The rest are still remaining.

393
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:28,450
So it bounces perfectly from the all the sides and the paddle itself as well, and I think that is going

394
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,080
to be it for this lecture.

395
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,980
And see you guys in the next one.
