00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.620
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.170
In this next year, we are going to go over modifying and updating objects.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.670
All right, so the first thing that I want to do is I want to be able to modify some objects.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.550
I'm just going to write might it fine objects and by modifying objects, what I mean is we are going

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.460
to change the data.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.180
All right.

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.620
We are going to change the object, the object date.

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.220
All right.

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.040
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a an object.

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.740
Well, actually, I'm not going to create I'm just going to paint it now.

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.440
And it says movie ratings.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.780
All right.

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.100
So we have Deadpool Pool.

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.800
We have a movie name and we have a number as a rating for that movie.

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.850
So we have a single word eskies and we have multiple awards as keys as well.

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.360
All right.

17
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.150
So this is our object that we have X-Men Days of Future Past, Thor, Wunderman and Superman.

18
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.800
All right.

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.440
So this is our object.

20
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.150
So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to log it to the console.

21
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.800
All right, and I'm going to say movie ratings and when you save it, all right.

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.390
So nothing new going on here.

23
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.930
This is our object.

24
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.590
So what if I want to change the rating of the movie Deadpool?

25
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.780
How can how can I do that?

26
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.440
All right.

27
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.430
So to be able to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to bring this movie a ratings way

28
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.240
down here and we are going to work here.

29
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.170
So first off, we are going to reference the object.

30
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.330
And through the bracket notation, we are going to grab the key whose value we are going to change.

31
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.980
So the value of the Deadpool, I want to change it from nine point one to nine point three.

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.380
And when I save it and when I check it out here, it says Deadpool nine point three.

33
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.980
We can do that for any other movie that we want.

34
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.770
For example, Superman.

35
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.920
I want to change it from nine to eight point five.

36
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.550
And now if we take a look at the Superman value, which is which was nine, now it is eight point five.

37
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.360
So this is how we can modify or change the object data.

38
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.790
First we reference the key and then we change the value for that key that we have referenced.

39
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.190
All right.

40
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.570
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to be able to update updating.

41
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.060
Updating the object.

42
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.730
I'm just going to write objects, so the next thing that I want to do is to be able to update the object

43
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.090
date.

44
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.840
All right.

45
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:49.150
So now, actually, there is something that I have to mention here is we are going to use the same method.

46
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.190
We are first going to access a key, and then we are going to give it a value.

47
00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:03.040
Now, by updating, what I actually mean is we can create more key value pairs.

48
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.080
All right.

49
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.830
So how we can create another key value pair or how we can add to the properties of this object.

50
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.400
So first off, we are going to go ahead and grab our object.

51
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.600
And then what?

52
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.890
What shall be the name of the key that we want to add?

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.650
The name of the key will be the winner, the winter soldier.

54
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.730
All right.

55
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.350
So this is the name of the key.

56
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.930
So what is each name?

57
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.090
Must have a value.

58
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.430
All right.

59
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.620
So what is the name?

60
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.450
What is the value for this key?

61
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.940
It is going to be nine point eight.

62
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.700
So now when I go ahead and I when I save it, we have movie ratings.

63
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.570
The Winter Soldier, nine point eight.

64
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.780
So when I bring I'm just going to comment this one out and I'm going to copy it and bring it down here

65
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.900
and uncommented and save it.

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080
And we should be able to see the Winter Soldier, nine point eight right here.

67
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.660
Right.

68
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.240
So I'm going to do one more.

69
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.710
And this is actually we are creating more key value pairs.

70
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.130
And for any key value pair, what we need is we need a key and then we need a value.

71
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.200
Right.

72
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.980
And we can create as many key value pairs as we want.

73
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.260
So now you can see originally inside this movie ratings object, we don't have any key that has a name

74
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.430
of the winter soldier.

75
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.690
But now when we look take a look at the console, we do have one because we just created one.

76
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.420
We can't create another one as well.

77
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.290
So it's going to be movie ratings.

78
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.230
OK, what shall be the next one?

79
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.590
I'm going to say just this week, Justice League, a poor culture.

80
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.740
Did I spell correctly?

81
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.930
Think so.

82
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.750
Right.

83
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.320
So what about this one?

84
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.480
I'm going to give it a nine point two when I save it.

85
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.180
And when we come here, we should be able to see Justice League apocalypse, which is not present in

86
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.860
our original object.

87
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.140
OK, so that's it for this lecture.

88
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.970
See you guys in the next one.
