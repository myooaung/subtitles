00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,930
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to implement the background color changer.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:16,320
All right, now, before going forward, we need to select what we what we want to implement.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,350
So the first thing that we need to implement is going to be these are in our Arga color, then the be

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,540
sorry, then the G and then where is the B. This is the B and then the Alpha Channel.

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,230
So we need to select all four of them.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,890
Right.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,770
Now, let's go ahead and let's select them.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come on top of here.

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,700
Now, this is the style you should come here, right?

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:54,400
And we are going to select RGV a I'm going to say RGV a R the first one is R and we are going to do

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,040
document dot, query selector.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,250
So what is the idea for this one?

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,319
The idea for this one is going to be rgv a dash r.

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,540
I think this is going to be the idea.

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,420
So yeah, this has an idea for Dash R and RGV a dash are I'm going to copy it three times.

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,970
You're going to change the second one to B and this is going to be sorry.

17
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:34,120
So this is always mix this argy bargy, this is going to be G as well are G B this is going to be B

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,400
and B as well and this is going to be a RAJEEB A a.

19
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:47,860
A great now we have successfully selected this one, I'm going to do as I'm going to select the RGV

20
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,290
container as well.

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,370
So this is the RGV container I'm going to selected by its class name.

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,440
Right.

23
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,860
And I'm going to call it RGV, a container.

24
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,910
Right.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,800
Document dart query selector, let's add.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,910
And the class name.

27
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:17,800
And I want to grab the RGA inputs, all of them at the same time as well, and the reason that we select

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,860
them, select these inputs twice is that we first off what we what we are going to do as we are going

29
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,750
to loop through all of them.

30
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,490
And whenever we want to change the value for any specific one of them, we are going to use these selectors

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,110
right here.

32
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,340
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to create another variable and I'm going to say

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,030
RGV inputs, inputs, all of them.

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,360
And we are going to grab our Rajiva container.

35
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,690
And from there, we are going to say, query, select all because there is clearly more than one and

36
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,980
we are going to grab all the inputs, right.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,580
So let's implement that.

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,490
They are going to say RGV or I'm just going to say background color.

39
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,730
Changer, right?

40
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,370
So.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,700
How does this actually work the way that we are going to implement this as we are going to loop through

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,600
all these elements and whenever the user changes one of them, we are going to apply that on the block

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,710
element that we have already selected in the JavaScript file.

44
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,030
All right.

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:40,040
So we are going to create a for loop and we are going to sell it AI equal to zero and the AI is going

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,730
to go all all the way to our RGV.

47
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,530
AI is not container inputs that length.

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,550
All right.

49
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:57,560
Because the index is going to be always one no less than the length the final index.

50
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,810
And each time we are going to increase them by one increment the loop variable by one.

51
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,100
Now we are going to grab our Rajiva inputs and we are going to pass an AI.

52
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:20,120
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to consider log this council, log RGV inputs and we are going

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,570
to pass.

54
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:27,140
And I say that that's come here and it's going to inspect and let's see what we are going to get.

55
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,710
And now you guys can see that we are going to get all of them, so.

56
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,980
We are going to get all of them right, because this for a loop is actually looping over all of these

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,780
inputs at the same time.

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,810
But this is not what we want.

59
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,130
We want to apply a functionality to it.

60
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:55,330
So whenever each of these is clicked or changed because their range or has changed, we want to apply

61
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,040
a specific function.

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,830
So we are going to say RGV a input's that out of a listener.

63
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,040
Right.

64
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,530
And we are listening for a change event.

65
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,760
When the change event is fired, we are going to run a function.

66
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:17,910
OK, and what is the function going to do, the function is going to grab our blog comment and it is

67
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:26,120
going to style it and the property is going to be background, color, background, color.

68
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,060
Right.

69
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,260
And now here is the tricky part, what should be the background color, the background color is, of

70
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,990
course, and our value.

71
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:44,120
So inside any RGV value, what we have is we have a red and then we have a green, then we have a blue

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,270
and then we have an A for the alpha channel.

73
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,420
So let's go ahead and let's replace all of them.

74
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,180
So for the red one, I'm going to do as.

75
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,450
We are going to use our specific or our individual

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,340
variables that we have created on top.

77
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,860
All right.

78
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,600
So for the red, what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass.

79
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,500
And first off, let's go ahead and let's remove all of them, because we are going to we are going to

80
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,820
pass in quotes, OK?

81
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,790
So I'm going to remove the red and I'm going to say and I'm going to concatenate a space here as well.

82
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:33,630
So I'm going to grab the RGV a our value because this is the red and we are going to use the value from

83
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:33,960
there.

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,850
OK, and we are going to add another.

85
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,430
So let's go ahead and let's remove the remaining.

86
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,180
So this is the RGV, a dot value Arga are that value and we want another value here as well.

87
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,900
And that is the for the green and for the blue and another one is for the Alpha Channel.

88
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,760
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in a comma because this should look like a Cyesis

89
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,470
property.

90
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,190
All right.

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:13,890
And then we are going to select the next color, which is RGV a G dot value.

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,760
And let's add in another comma in here.

93
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:31,560
And then we are going to grab the RGV A, B, RGV A, where is the B dot value K, where is the plus

94
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,730
sign for this?

95
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,820
Here it is.

96
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
Here is the plus sign.

97
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,550
And then finally, we are going to add another comma.

98
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,590
And finally now it is finally.

99
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,120
This is really difficult to type.

100
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,950
All right, and we are going to grab the RGV a a dot value, right?

101
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,400
And I think this is going to be it.

102
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,120
Let's save it.

103
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,840
And the Vaska prettier does this in the end.

104
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,710
All right.

105
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,420
So it says Oncotype for now is not a function.

106
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,020
Rajiva Input's is not a function.

107
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,180
Of course it isn't.

108
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,600
We need the loof variable as well.

109
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,590
So let's save it.

110
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,560
Let's come here.

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,180
We don't have any more errors.

112
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,130
So if I bring this here, the red is changing.

113
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,750
The block has disappeared, so.

114
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,450
So if I come here, it is blue.

115
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,120
So the blue is working, the green is working, but the red the red is also working out.

116
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,530
Right.

117
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,340
So if I decrease the alpha channel, it is going to go away.

118
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,549
So let's put it there and decrease it.

119
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,360
It doesn't work.

120
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,780
The Alpha Channel does not work.

121
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,920
So let's go into our JavaScript.

122
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,220
Oh, this is our baby.

123
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,990
So I'm sure you've got that.

124
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,440
Save it.

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,250
And let's click here.

126
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,990
Now, this is the Alpha Channel.

127
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,230
This is the blue.

128
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,350
This is the green.

129
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,250
This is the.

130
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,640
Ah.

131
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:09,240
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to close this, increase the size, bring it to almost center,

132
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,140
bring it a little bit down and now we can work with it.

133
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,020
So this is how you can implement cyesis property change.

134
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,110
Very, very visual.

135
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,140
All right.

136
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,820
So if I come here into the inspect.

137
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,490
And let's grab our block, so can we grab it?

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,780
Yes, let's go into computer and now you can also grab this.

139
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,890
For example, you you are looking for color, I don't know, like ideas.

140
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,310
Right.

141
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,680
So the way you can use this background color is just just inspected and you're going to see that this

142
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,700
is the background color.

143
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:56,020
So if I put the red almost to end, almost do this for the red, the to one should be 255.

144
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,100
So now it is two hundred and fifty five.

145
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,380
Let's put the G it is going to be 255 and if I put it to blue then it is going to be completely white.

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,310
So this is a white color.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
This is going to be it for this project.

148
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,900
See you guys in the next one.
