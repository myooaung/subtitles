00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,400
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to resolve the DoubleClick issue of this game.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,440
All right, so what is the DoubleClick issue?

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:20,290
So if I come into the final product, if I can if I go ahead and if I double click on this card and

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,330
this card, we can see that it works perfectly fine.

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,000
So let me just do it once more.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,560
I'm sure you are going to hear the double click.

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:29,980
So.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,750
But even though if I even though I'm double clicking on one card and clicking another, I'm still not

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,280
able to click on the third card, see, so double click, click.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,580
And then I cannot I cannot select the third card.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,580
But what about here?

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:57,630
So if I double click on this card and if I click on this and this, we can see that we can flip a third

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,900
card and this stays in its own place.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,020
So double click on this double click on this double click on this double click on this.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,470
Now you can see all all these cards, they stay in their own place, so.

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,370
See, so this is the issue that I'm talking about and this is what we are going to fix in here.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,580
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go here and I'm going to come right here on top

18
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,500
and we are going to implement another

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,340
flow control if statement in here.

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:39,350
So basically what we want is we want to look for the this keywords value and we are going to evaluate

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,750
it against the first car.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,930
So we are going to say this.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:51,410
So if this keywords value and we remember that this keywords value is the value of any card, who that

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,190
has been clicked.

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,470
So it is going to tell us exactly what card has been click.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,840
So we are going to say if if it is equal to the first card, we are going to return the function.

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,060
So if we are clicking twice on one card, then this function is going to return.

28
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,699
It is not going to run.

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,690
Now, let's go over this one more time.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,880
If if we are clicking, if the card that we have clicked on is the first card, it means it's our first

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,510
click.

32
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,940
Then this it with this condition evaluates to true and this function is going to wrap up and go and

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,920
it is going to wrap up everything.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,090
And this logic is not going to implement it if this is true.

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,980
Now let's say we click on the second card or we click on the same card for the second time, then the

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,490
value of this keyword is not going to be the first card.

37
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,260
It is going to be the second card.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,950
All right.

39
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,110
And this is not going to be evaluated to true.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
And this is going to be evaluated to false.

41
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,610
Then the return keyword is not going to do anything because the condition is not true.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,530
And then this code is going to run.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,630
OK, to properly implement this, we need to add a function.

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,550
And I'm going to come down here.

45
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,960
And we are going to create a function and I'm going to call it a function.

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,000
Come on, buddy.

47
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,720
Function and I'm going to call it reset board, OK, we're going to take it one step further.

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,040
And in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the structuring, assign a restructuring assignment.

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,330
I'm going to give you a blank where you can read more about it.

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,430
You can just come here and put it right here.

51
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,130
So the structuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values

52
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,850
from arrays.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,050
And this is the part where we are looking for an values from arrays.

54
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,470
And in case you want to know what is which part of this structuring assignment we are using, it's exactly

55
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,090
this part.

56
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:10,060
So the value of A is going to be equal to B and the value of B is going to be equal to A.

57
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,070
So and you can read all about it here.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,560
Right.

59
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,149
So this is the Indian doux.

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,140
I just gave you the link for that, so this is the link, this is the structuring assignment and we

61
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,000
are going to close it.

62
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,810
So if I come here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an array and I'm going to say card is

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,370
flipped.

64
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,270
And also another item inside this array is going to be LOC board and I'm going to set them equal to.

65
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,020
So the first value that I put here, this value is going to be set to card is flipped.

66
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,360
And when I put in a comma and another value, the other value is going to be set for the lock board.

67
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,270
Right.

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,950
I'm also going to grab our first card.

69
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,690
And our second card.

70
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,740
And I'm going to set said both of them to know and not all right, so we can do.

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,050
We should provide it with semicolon so we could do it this way.

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,340
This is called structuring assignment.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,970
This make this reduces the number of lines of code that we have.

74
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,360
So this thing is equal to Hoopes.

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,840
Equal to if we were to say card is flipped.

76
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:38,940
Let's set it equal to falls and then log board set it equal to falls and then let's grab the first come

77
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:47,040
on, let's grab the first card, set it to null and let's grab the second card and set it.

78
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,420
No.

79
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,970
So instead of doing all this, we did this.

80
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,090
So cards flipped is false.

81
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,770
Like board is false.

82
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,570
First card null.

83
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,680
Second call no.

84
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,610
So instead of doing that we could use the structuring.

85
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,650
This is is six syntax.

86
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,180
Very, very cool stuff.

87
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,450
So now where do we call this reset board.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,540
So now we can see here we have a lock board, false.

89
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,800
And in here we also have a lock work force.

90
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,250
So I'm going to remove this and I'm going to call our reset board function in here.

91
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,150
So this is where we called it.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,530
This is the first place that I'm going to call it.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,020
The second place that we need to call it is actually right here.

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,820
So right here.

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,140
So it says card is flipped.

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,190
False, right.

97
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,870
And here we also have call it called card is flipped equal to false.

98
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,220
But I'm not going to pass it here because we have called the check for match function and inside the

99
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,250
check for match function, we have a disabled cards and inside the disabled cards is where I'm going

100
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,000
to call it.

101
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,980
And I'm going to save it.

102
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,800
And I'm going to remove this from here because this is the thing that I just remove.

103
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,890
Card is equal defaults is going to come from chick check a match and for the chick for match, it is

104
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,980
going to come from disable cards and from the disable cards.

105
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,990
It's going to come from reset board and from the reset board that is going to come from right here.

106
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,560
So it's like many layers, deep function call.

107
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,400
Right.

108
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,540
And let's come here.

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,140
So if I double click.

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,430
And click on this, OK, that that was a match, so let's click on something that is not a match.

111
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,940
So double click, click.

112
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,970
See, I cannot click on the third one until these two they evaluate either to true or false.

113
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,700
I cannot click on the third one.

114
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,070
So let's reset.

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,240
Let's make this thing.

116
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,920
I don't think we need to make it smaller because this is, I think, fully responsive.

117
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,700
Very cool, very cool stuff.

118
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,550
So double click, click.

119
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,200
I cannot click on a third card.

120
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,120
And this is the thing that this is the functionality that I wanted to cover in this video.

121
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,790
See you guys in the next one.
