1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,360
However, one in this letter, we are going to create our ad to do function.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,440
All right, so before diving into that function, let's go ahead and let's create some variables and

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,740
we are going to store inside these variables the e-mail elements that we want to work with.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:22,580
Right.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,020
So the first thing that I know that I'm going to grab is going to in our clear button.

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm going to call it clear BTN.

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,110
And we are going to say document that query, selected and selected using our query selector method.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,270
All right.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,320
And it has a class of clear.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,130
Right.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,220
The next thing that I want to grab is the to do list.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,060
So this is the you will because we are going to grab this you, Al, and we are going to give it to

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,670
children.

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,340
Right.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,370
So consed I'm going to call it to do list.

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,150
All right.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,830
And we are going to select it again using our query selector and it has an IDF list.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,790
The next thing that we need is our to do input.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,070
So what is the to do input.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:19,790
This is the to do input the to do input as the input where we write our to dos and whenever we hit enter

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,780
or we click on the plus side, we are going to see that, that to do is added here.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,460
Right.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,280
So we need to grab this input.

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,340
We also need to grab this plus sign as well.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:38,930
And as far as the enter key is concerned, we can just use the code for that, which is number 13 and

26
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,650
we can select it and add an event.

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,710
Listen to that.

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,360
So we are going to do input.

29
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:58,160
OK, document that query selector we usually use query selector, you can mix and match, you can mix

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,410
them up, you can use document that get Alman by ID, but I really like query selector.

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,460
It's really broad, it's really fast and it's good.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,900
It's a good practice as well.

33
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,950
So consed we are going to do.

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,560
And B10, right, and this is the plus sign that we are going to grab now, this one we are going to

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,370
grab by its class and the class is a very, very unique class.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,200
It is a dash plus dash circle spotted here.

37
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,260
Let's have it now.

38
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,000
We have successfully selected what we wanted to say.

39
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,130
So what I'm going to do is not go that way.

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,070
I want to add a I just want to separate different sections of this website, this application, because

41
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,930
I think there is a lot that goes underneath.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,560
There is a lot more.

43
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,470
The inner workings is very, very delicate under the hood of this application.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,020
And I do not want you guys to get confused.

45
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,930
I want you guys to really understand what we are doing.

46
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,310
Right.

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,890
So right after this, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to write here a comment saying, selecting

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,080
the icon class class names.

49
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,630
Now we are going to select these icon class names, but I'm not going to tell you why right at this

50
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,980
point.

51
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,740
Now, maybe like within this lecture or in the next lecture.

52
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,370
Definitely.

53
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,750
I'm going to try to tell you by the end of this lecture so we have a check.

54
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,620
But button.

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,110
OK, so what is the check button?

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,060
Where is our check?

57
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,940
OK, it's not inside here because we are going to add a dynamically, of course.

58
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,010
So I'm just going to grab the you know what?

59
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm going to grab all three of them.

60
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,170
I think we have styled them here, so they should be here.

61
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,530
So this is our line through.

62
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,820
We are going to grab that.

63
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,040
This is DFA dot f a dash check that dash circle.

64
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,490
We are going to add that class dynamically to an icon.

65
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,420
Right.

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,760
And the next one that I want to grab is uncheck BTN, which we are going to which which which is going

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,240
to allow us to revert back to that thin circle that we had.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,910
So if I come here, where is that circle?

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,440
How can we find it?

70
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,940
So do we have it here?

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,060
I think it is it is also dynamically added, so I'm just going to ride the class name here.

72
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,220
So it is a dash circle dash fan.

73
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:43,450
OK, and finally, we are going to grab our text line through.

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Right.

75
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,120
And what is the class for that.

76
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,930
The class for that is present inside the C assess the classes which are inside the courses there only

77
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,430
for styling purposes.

78
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,790
The reason that this thin circle is not inside the success is because whenever we are dealing with this

79
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,060
circle, we do not want to style it.

80
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,600
It is added as it is.

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,050
That's why we are not going to add a specific style.

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,090
But whenever we're dealing with this green one, with this check one, then we will be dealing with

83
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,420
some sort of styling.

84
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,460
That's why this class is added inside the success.

85
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,520
So these are selecting the icon class names.

86
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,460
You are going to feed them to this application dynamically.

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,410
And now let's go ahead and let's create our add to do function.

88
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:39,400
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say I'm creating I'm just going to call it add to do

89
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,260
a function.

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,730
All right, so this is our ad to do function, they're going to say function.

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:57,700
Why do I always misspell that ad to do right now in here, I'm going to pass in four parameters and

92
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm going to explain why four parameters, the first one is going to be able to do, which is very simple

93
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,360
to understand.

94
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,660
Right.

95
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,090
The second one is going to be the IED.

96
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:17,290
The IED is a number according to which our items or a to do list to do list items, they're going to

97
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,150
get arranged.

98
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,450
So if I were to come here and to write another to do even though both of them have the same text, if

99
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:32,770
I come into application and come in here inside the storage, what we are going to see is that the to

100
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,940
do the first to do has an idea of zero, OK?

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,370
And the second one has an idea of one.

102
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:47,230
That's how they are arranged inside this this to do list application and where we see that we have a

103
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:54,700
done which is false and we have a track which is false, meaning that we are going to add two more parameters

104
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:54,940
here.

105
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:03,760
So we are going to say Don and Trish, because each to do is basically working with four different things.

106
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,790
The first one is the to do text.

107
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,930
The second one is the to do number in order write.

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,330
The third one is going to be the status of that to do OK.

109
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,300
The status is either done or like or not done, which is trash.

110
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:21,880
Right.

111
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:30,040
So in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another constant because inside this constant

112
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,990
I want to store a To-Do done so to do done.

113
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,530
OK, so whenever that to do is done, what does it mean?

114
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,060
It means that we are going to grab this parameter, OK, and we are going to put it here.

115
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,290
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a ternary operator.

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,060
So if you know what, at first I'm just going to go ahead and delete this.

117
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm just going to explain it like this.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,440
And then we are going to store the results inside that variable.

119
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,030
So if done is true, what do we want to do?

120
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,610
If done is true, we want the check button.

121
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,410
If it is not true, we want to grab the uncheck button.

122
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,440
Very simple.

123
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:15,070
So if done is true, it means that if I click on now, you can see that this done is false.

124
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,550
So if I click on it now, this is done is true.

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,170
It means that the to do is done.

126
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,750
If done is true.

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,940
If done is true.

128
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,360
If you just put it simply here it is going to be a boolean expression.

129
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,470
We have talked about this.

130
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,240
If done is true, we are going to implement check button.

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,370
If it is not, we are going to show the uncheck button and what is the uncheck button it is in.

132
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,860
If it has a class of Faida Circle dash, then that's why we selected these.

133
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,280
We have written the text of the class names individually right here.

134
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,450
So now the result of this is either going to be this or it's going to be this, right?

135
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
So it is going to be one of the above.

136
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,180
I'm just going to grab and delete that.

137
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,430
So whatever the result is, I want to store it inside this variable.

138
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,280
All right.

139
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,130
We are going to create another variable here.

140
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,560
And then we are we will wrap up this lecture.

141
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,370
Right.

142
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,090
So now so this is the first thing that we want to do.

143
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,070
The second thing, whenever the done is true, as F done is true.

144
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,200
We want the text line through to apply as well.

145
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,370
So whenever the to do is done, there are two things that we do.

146
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,300
The first thing is we show this icon, this Tegmark icon, and the second thing is we can see this line

147
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,010
through here.

148
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,100
So we want to show both of them.

149
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,860
So if done is true, why do we want to do is we are going to show the text line through, otherwise

150
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,360
we are just going to show an empty string or an empty string.

151
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,690
Right.

152
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,770
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to save the result of this to a variable called to do a line

153
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,390
that's set.

154
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,980
And now we are going to use these this data dynamically to create a list item, which we are going to

155
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,390
implement in our next lecture.

156
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,580
See you guys then.
