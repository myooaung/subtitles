Hi, everyone, this lecture we're going to talk about the object keys method.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,670
All right, so the Object Keys method is going to return all of the keys from an object.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,550
So this is an object specific method.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:27,390
So now let's go ahead and let's see what we're going to do as we are going to create an element, create

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,080
a variable, not an element.

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,330
And we're going to call it Kei's because in here, here is where we are going to save all of our kids

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,720
now to grab all of the keys from any object we call the object d'art keys.

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,500
All right.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,250
And we passing the object name that we have.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,630
So the object name is FAF Colors.

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,450
Right.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,920
And now let's go ahead and let's say cancel the lock keys and we should be able to get all the keys

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,240
and notice that it returns all of them inside an array.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,070
All right.

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,760
So we can access each of these keys individually as well through a for each loop.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
So we are going to say keys dot foreach first stuff.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,990
We grabbed all the keys of this object and we started inside this keys, which returns an array, even

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,910
though the keys, they belong to an object.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,000
But when you extract him from the object, they're going to be returned in an array because arrays are

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,550
so, so useful.

21
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,360
All right.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,230
So and then we are going we can call the array for each method because it is an array.

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,190
So what are we going to do as I'm going to create the parameter and I'm going to call it key and we

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,870
are going to run this function.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,780
Now, what is the function is going to do?

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,460
The function is simply going to log to the console our key.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,330
And when I say that, we can see that we have caller one, we have color, too, and we have color three

28
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,530
that set for this lecture.

29
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,200
See you guys in the next one.
