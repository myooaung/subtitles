00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,610
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,190
In this lecture, we are going to talk about JavaScript conditionals.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,090
All right, so the first set of conditions that we are going to talk about are going to be if statements

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,540
and the second set is going to be the switch statements.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:19,920
All right.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:28,180
So we are going to start with the very basics of statements and why we need them now if statements in

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,420
JavaScript, they allow us to control the flow of code.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,780
For example, if we want to check for a condition and when that condition is met, we want some sort

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,340
of logic to be implemented.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,160
And when that condition is not met, we do not want that logic to be implemented.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,420
All right.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:57,790
So starting from the basics, first off, we are going to take a look at the if statement, which is

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,490
checking only for a single condition.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:00,910
All right.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:08,470
You could call these if statements these conditional generally the decision making process in JavaScript.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,490
All right.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,520
So let's go ahead and let's dive into the syntax.

18
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:19,330
So for creating an if statement, first off, we just write the F and we open the parentheses and then

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,680
a set of curly braces.

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,380
So this is the regular syntax for an if statement in JavaScript.

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:34,540
And what this means is if some kind if a condition is met, which the condition comes inside, these

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,170
parentheses say the condition.

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,800
All right.

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:45,340
If this condition is met, then run, run this code.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,250
The this is what basically an if statement does and how it works.

26
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,960
It checks for a condition.

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,320
And if that condition is met, it is going to run a code and that's it.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,700
This is how simple if statements are in JavaScript.

29
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,540
All right.

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:09,039
So first off, let's go ahead and let's take a look at the first condition that we want to take a look

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,180
at.

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,680
Right.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,990
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to create a name that is Tom.

34
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,370
And I'm going to check if Tom is equal to Tom.

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,710
Right, Tom?

36
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,300
And this is our example.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,820
Example one.

38
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,280
Come on, buddy.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:40,910
All right, so if this string, Tom, is equal in both value and time to the string of Tom, we want

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,880
to run a code that says conservate log.

41
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,750
Yay, Tom.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,480
Right now, let's see what we can see our results right here, and this happens because Tom is equal

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,770
to Tom in both value and in both tie.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,280
All right.

45
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,240
So this is our first example.

46
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,270
And in case they are not equal, then this coat is not going to run.

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to show you that in our second example.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,680
All right.

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,370
So this is example two in here.

50
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:23,330
First off, we just tried the keyword and then a set of parentheses, followed by a set of curly braces.

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,100
And we said if.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:36,260
All right, so let's go ahead and let's ride over condition, so we said if Jack is equal to Tom, console

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,610
the log.

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:48,890
No way, and it's safe and we don't see anything because if we want this code to run inside the console,

55
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,900
this condition should be true.

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,160
If the condition is not true, the code is not going to run.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,830
This is how we can control the flow of code, the flow of logic.

58
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,400
Let's say you have, for example, 10 lines of logic inside your statement and 100 lines of logic before

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,610
that.

60
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,970
If statement, if the condition of this statement is met, then then the rest of the code is going to

61
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,240
run.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,839
And if it does not meet, the rest of the code is not going to run.

63
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,760
This is how if statements work.

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,399
So I'm just going to go ahead.

65
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,460
I'm going to give you one more example and then we are going to take it up a notch.

66
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,790
Right.

67
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,720
So this is going to be our example.

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,220
Number three, first off, let's go ahead and let's write our condition and we say, let's say time

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,270
is equal to, I don't know, like, oh, 700, let's go militari on this.

70
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,380
So that time equal to, oh, 700.

71
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,080
If time is equal to oh, 700, we are going to consult the log.

72
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,510
Good Morning, America.

73
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,280
All right, so if time is over 700 means it's seven a.m. we print.

74
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,220
Good morning.

75
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:14,190
If this example is actually I've provided this in a deliberate way, because in in later on in just

76
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,810
a few minutes, we are going to.

77
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,490
Take this and we are going to take it to the next level, OK, and we are going to build up on this

78
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,090
example.

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,390
All right, so when the time is, oh, 700, we want to cancel the log.

80
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,060
Good morning.

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,210
But if it is not 700, for example, if it is 800, then we don't see any message.

82
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,130
OK, but this is not accurate.

83
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,130
So we are going to make make sure that this stays accurate.

84
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,120
All right.

85
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,880
So this is a simple if statement, simple if statements they check for a single condition.

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:06:00,290
We can also we have an an F üç statement which checks for two conditions, checking for two conditions.

87
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,190
Two conditions, right?

88
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,870
Now, if a condition is met, then we want to run a certain code and if that condition is not met,

89
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,650
we want to run a certain other code, that's basically the ideology behind this.

90
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,020
So we are going to say, if so, before writing the F, I'm just going to create two variables and I'm

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,460
going to say let's score be equal to 10.

92
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:32,930
All right.

93
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,060
And I say F score is equal to 10.

94
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,220
Right.

95
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,010
I want to present to the console console of log.

96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,380
Great.

97
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,660
Let's put it inside quotes, great.

98
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:58,390
Hey, and now, if this condition is not met, then what in that in that case, what do you want to

99
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,660
do?

100
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,890
Then we write and our statement.

101
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,290
All right.

102
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,830
And here we are going to say consider log.

103
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,160
And I'm going to explain it one more time.

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,570
It says, great, we.

105
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:18,610
So now, because the score is 10 and the condition is met, we run this code and the L's statement and

106
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,530
in a condition on says that in any other scenario we want to run this code.

107
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:32,590
So if the score is nine, run grade B, if the score is eight, then run grade B if the score is.

108
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:40,320
If the score is, let's say, seven, then run grade B, it doesn't matter what the score is, as long

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,420
as it is not ten, we will bring to the council A, grade B, so the F, the L part of this conditional

110
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,890
says in any other scenario, run this code.

111
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,560
All right.

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,280
So if this if the condition is met, we are going to run the first code.

113
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,220
And if the condition is not met, it doesn't matter what the number is, even if it is 10000, we are

114
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,890
going to see grade B because other than 10, every other number is our every other scenario.

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,630
This is how the statement works here.

116
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,550
All right.

117
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,630
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to we are going to dive even deeper into this.

118
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,230
So this is the statement.

119
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,650
I'm just going to go ahead and remove the F from the start of it.

120
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,810
And now we are going to go ahead and we are going to create another if else statement.

121
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:41,120
If statement that is going to check for more than two conditions, if our statement checking for more

122
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,050
for more than two conditions.

123
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,710
Right.

124
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,550
This is the first statement, so we are going to create a variable and it is going to be score, I could

125
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,830
go ahead and work with this time variable.

126
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,240
All right.

127
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,390
But I'm not going to do the score is a better this is a better example.

128
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,950
So we are going to save score is equal to 10.

129
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,370
All right.

130
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,110
And first off, we initialize this variable, and that is let's score equal to ten.

131
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,250
If if score is equal to ten, then what do we want to do?

132
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,070
We want to present to the console what grade?

133
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,370
Hey, now, what if the score is not ten?

134
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,240
OK, what if the score is eight?

135
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:36,060
We do not want to print, for example, for the score of five grade B because that is not accurate.

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,370
So instead of writing and if an else statement alone, we are going to write and else if statement.

137
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:43,940
Right.

138
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,400
And we can write any number of F else if statements as we want.

139
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,590
All right.

140
00:09:50,900 --> 00:10:00,740
So else if the score is let's go ahead and let's say the score is nine, then run the code, cancel

141
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,940
the log.

142
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,020
Grade B, right?

143
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,530
And what if the score is seven?

144
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,770
So what if when the score is seven or when the score is eight?

145
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,230
I do not want to play into the concert grade B so I can go ahead and I can create another elusive statement,

146
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,500
because it doesn't matter how many Ancef statements you create, you are free to do that.

147
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,930
OK, so we are going to grab the score and we are going to put it here and we are going to change it

148
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,260
from nine to eight and we are going to copy that and put it right here.

149
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,660
So when the score is eight, we want to present to the Council of Great C..

150
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,060
OK, and what if the score is seven?

151
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,870
So when the score is seven, what do we want to do?

152
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,300
We want to present to the council if the score is seven, we want to present to the council grade.

153
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,430
Right.

154
00:10:53,650 --> 00:11:01,720
And in any other scenario, in any other scenario, we want to present to the council grade F.

155
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,020
Great, let's save it.

156
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,370
So first off, because the score is 10, we are going to get great, eh?

157
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:09,970
All right.

158
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,750
So this is an NFL statement.

159
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,240
It is checking for more than two conditions as you get.

160
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,700
And now you guys can see this is our first condition, second, third, fourth, and this is our fifth

161
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,210
condition.

162
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:28,810
But in the first if statement, we can we could only check for one condition in the statement, we can

163
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,400
only check for two conditions.

164
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,850
But in the NFL statement, we can check for more than two conditions.

165
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,180
All right.

166
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,400
So if score is ten, we are going to see a grade A F score is nine.

167
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,020
We are going to see grade B.

168
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,330
When the score is eight, we should see great, see?

169
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,960
All right, and when the score is seven, we should see great.

170
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,270
And in any other scenario, we should see great effort.

171
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,110
So if I put it to six, we are going to see a great F..

172
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,470
Now, this this example is not actually like a completely done.

173
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,540
It is not like a full application because there are there are a lot of problems with this.

174
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,480
What if the score is not 10?

175
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,770
What if the score is 11?

176
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,890
What is one of the score?

177
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,520
15.

178
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,430
What if the score is nine point five?

179
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,100
Right.

180
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,350
What if in that what happens in that condition and that condition?

181
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,790
We don't have any other scenario.

182
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,060
So in any other scenario, we are just going to go ahead and print F to the console.

183
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:41,070
So if the score if the score is let's uncommented and let's put it to 11, we are going to see grade

184
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,960
F, OK?

185
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:48,510
If the score is nine point five, we are going to see grade F, even though nine point five classifies

186
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,350
as grade grade B or B plus.

187
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:58,440
But still we are going to see a grade F. So this is the problem with this application, because this

188
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,200
is just we are just getting started with if our statements we are just getting started with conditionals.

189
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,340
So we do not like create four applications here.

190
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,710
That's why there are like a ton of projects in this course.

191
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,810
So we can come up, we can make up for any other condition that we want we might have.

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,250
So we want to make sure that whatever problem that you might face in the real world, you have a solution

193
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,240
for that in mind.

194
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,490
Or you can come up with a solution, which is the best thing that you can do.

195
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,210
OK, so that's it for this lecture.

196
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,020
See you guys in the next one.
