1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome to Part three of Coding and I.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:16,129
All right, so this is where we left off in a previous lecture, we changed our code inside or whenever

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,070
we wanted to populate the options.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,640
Now, when this code is changed, the option code has all must also change.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,390
Now, I don't mean like changing it to here.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,750
Now it is this is the general code.

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,490
This is the specific code that we need to change.

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,650
We need to accommodate for that side.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,490
We need to get the coordinates of that side.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:43,160
So I'm going to pass on the side here and let's go ahead.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,220
And that's before actually passing it here.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,640
What I would like to do is let's actually define it, so we are going to say no.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,130
Now, this is going to be each of those individual neighboring sites.

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:07,200
If option dot sites dot length is greater than zero, it means that we do have some neighboring sites.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,730
We want our site to be that neighboring, to be one of those neighboring sites.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,540
So option DOT sites, which side it is, that is going to be the job of EHI to find out.

17
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,310
We are just going to randomize it for the perfect.

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:37,140
So we are going to say math are random and let's multiplied by the length of the options options sites

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,980
that length.

20
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,970
Perfect.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,520
Now we do have our site.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,600
Now this site is going to be an argument in here as well because this get free site coordinates is actually

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,940
responsible for getting the coordinates to that to the sites.

24
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,390
Right.

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,480
Perfect.

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,290
So why don't we go ahead and let's why don't we go ahead and modify this now?

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,120
There is one more thing here, and that is you can see that inside our options push.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,039
We do have a square property there, right?

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,750
So that square property is a property of the options array, array of objects.

30
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,830
But that is going to be a property of the each individual options as well.

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,730
So options are going to have squares.

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,940
Option is going to have square, plural, plural, singular, singular.

33
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,930
So we need to pass in the dart square here as well.

34
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,030
So I'm just going to pass it there and let's travel downwards.

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,290
So here we are seeing that get coordinates.

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,340
Of each site now here we did coordinates of a free site and we are going to say otherwise.

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,950
So we are going to do coordinates of each site, otherwise we are going to graph coordinates from a

38
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,480
free site.

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:03,960
Right.

40
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,580
But we need to be prepared for both of the scenarios.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,390
So it's going to be coordinates.

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,430
And first off, this is going to be no, we don't have any coordinates.

43
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,470
Now, let's go ahead and let's check for that site.

44
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:25,660
And the side is right here, right, and let's see, so in our case, our first case.

45
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,720
The side is bottom.

46
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,580
What do we want to do?

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,880
We want our coordinates.

48
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:48,400
Which is here to be that coordinated bottom coordinates, bottom right, and then we want to break out

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,090
of this loop.

50
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:59,670
Perfect, so let's do this for all of the sites three more times and enter, enter and enter.

51
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,990
So what if it is left, then the coordinates is going to be Kurnitz.

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,540
Left, right.

53
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,310
What if it is right?

54
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,520
Then it is going to be the right side coordinates.

55
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,959
And finally, if it is top.

56
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,610
It is going to be the topsides coordinates.

57
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,550
OK?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,890
And if after all of these if statements switch cases, still there were coordinates is no.

59
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,590
We just want to return it.

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,230
So.

61
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,600
If Kurnitz.

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:48,130
Is not is not null if it does not know if it is or if it is not null, we want to return it.

63
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,200
If it does, no, we don't want to return it.

64
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,150
So we are just going to say return cordin.

65
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,920
It's perfect.

66
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:02,660
Now, one final thing, I promise one final thing, and that is we just have to go ahead and create

67
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,360
that function that we called and that is good, valid neighbor sites.

68
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,930
So this function.

69
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,950
Let me grab the name, very, very long name.

70
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,090
And I'm going to come on top of the function and let's put it here, commented out and say function.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,590
We are going to say function, put it right there.

72
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,750
Now we need to pass in row and column is parameters.

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,240
What do we want this function to do?

74
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:38,270
This function is actually B is going to be responsible for handling the side Y because the side is actually

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,950
equal to this function.

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,800
The function call is stored within the sides.

77
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,290
So this function is actually going to give us whichever side it is for the neighbor.

78
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:57,530
And I keep in mind this is not the side that the H is going to choose, but this is the side that the

79
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,130
A.I. is going to choose from its neighbor.

80
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:01,840
Right.

81
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,900
This is the sides neighbors side that the is going to choose.

82
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:17,000
So that side that you saw how the animator made a mistake because it was the neighbor's side, the I

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,600
didn't care about the neighbor this function is going to make is going to train and we're able to take

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,370
care to take the neighbors into consideration as well.

85
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,330
So we are going to set for a size and our size is going to be an array.

86
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,480
And then let's go ahead and let's create our square in here as well.

87
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,650
The square is going to be squares, row and also column.

88
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,070
Now, we are going to do some stuff in here that I'm going to try my best to explain.

89
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,120
All right.

90
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:01,030
So first off, I'm going to say checking for checked, not for checking the left hand side, checking

91
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,120
the left hand side if it is.

92
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,410
Not selected already.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,310
Now, if it is selected already, it means that the will make a mistake and give us points.

94
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,690
Right, and we are going through all this hassle just to make the I not do that.

95
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,990
We don't want to we don't want the air to give us points we can score by ourselves.

96
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,490
I mean, we are big boys, right?

97
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,800
So we are going to say F oops, not there.

98
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,400
So the same thing.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:44,700
We are going to say f the squares, the squares left side.

100
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,830
First off, I mean we used to do the bottom first.

101
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,090
Right.

102
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,710
So let's go ahead and let's do the bottom first.

103
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:59,080
If the squares bottom side is not selected now this is being selected.

104
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,380
Right.

105
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:08,510
But if I put in the non-equity operator, it is going to say not selected and checking the bottom hand

106
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,800
site if it is not selected.

107
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,020
So when it is bottom, it means it's in the vertical direction.

108
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,350
So in this case, we are going to check for the.

109
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,260
What do we want to check for the ROE?

110
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,790
When it is bottom?

111
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,390
It means we are at the end of our game, right at the end of the rows.

112
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,720
So what is the end of any array?

113
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,860
The end of an era is the length of that array, minus one.

114
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,840
So squares the length minus one.

115
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,799
So if Roe is the final ROE or.

116
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:54,300
Our squares array our squares, array, row plus one in this in this, we are going to say plus one

117
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,810
because we are adding it, the column is going to be the same and then we are going to send some selected

118
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,130
is less than two.

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,070
What does the selected is going to give us?

120
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,070
It is going to give us the number of sites that are selected.

121
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:20,400
Now keep in mind, we are remedying the the problem that the D.A. has and that that problem arises whenever

122
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,620
the number of sides are less than two.

123
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,440
That problem arose, I think arose in our second priority.

124
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,760
Second priority was when the number of sides were less than two.

125
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,160
If there are three, that is first priority that I was going to do with ease.

126
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:47,640
If it is if the sides are ready to write, it is not less than two, but two, then the I will have

127
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,780
to give us some points.

128
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,510
I mean, we don't we have already handled that as well.

129
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,950
The problem that we faced is in the second priority when the square has zero sides or one side.

130
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,380
So zero and one, they're less than two.

131
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:08,280
So we are going to say less that if this is true, we are going to grab our sides are and we are going

132
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,040
to push to it which side it is.

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,740
It is the side, but perfect.

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,790
Very simple.

135
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,060
Right.

136
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,110
So now that you have understood this, we're going to do something similar for I'm going to do them

137
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,260
one by one because they tend to get a bit confusing.

138
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,710
So checking the left now.

139
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,530
We are going to check the left hand side.

140
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:39,720
So in the left, we are in the starting point of our our game or our grid.

141
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,410
So for that, we are not actually checking.

142
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,160
When we are moving from left to right, we are working with the columns.

143
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,560
And because it is left, it is going to be our very first column.

144
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,500
So I'm just going to say zero if column equals zero or now we are no longer working with row and because

145
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,230
we are moving to the left, we are going to send negative one.

146
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:13,980
If that is, if if this condition or this condition is true, then we want to push to the sides side

147
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,060
left.

148
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,900
Perfect.

149
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,060
Copy that.

150
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,110
Put it down here.

151
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,200
Now let's check right as well now.

152
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,820
Right is whenever we have a lot of columns, right?

153
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,270
Basically, it is going to be double length, minus one.

154
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,130
What is the length of the columns?

155
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,920
The length of the columns is going to be like this length, minus one.

156
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:50,240
Length are perfect and or what is the or condition that we want to do because we are moving to the positive

157
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,870
direction, we are going to say Collum plus one, if this is the case, let's grab it and let's push

158
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,740
this the right side to the sides array.

159
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,670
Keep in mind, this side's array is actually disvalue that is going to be returned from this function,

160
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,840
and we know we have two situations for that, right?

161
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,490
Perfect.

162
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,550
So the right side is also done.

163
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,770
And what is the final side that we need to take into account?

164
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,860
That is going to be the top side.

165
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,120
So let's copy that.

166
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
Let's put it right here.

167
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,350
The top side.

168
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,270
I'm trying to go a bit slower because this is a bit difficult to handle.

169
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,580
That's why I'm slowing down a little.

170
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,240
So what about this side top?

171
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,660
So whenever it is tough, we are moving in the arrows, right?

172
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,030
Top bottom.

173
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,860
We are moving in the rose, left, right.

174
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,130
We are moving in the columns.

175
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,420
Perfect.

176
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,770
So when it is top, it means it is going to be the starting row.

177
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,820
Right.

178
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,240
And we are no longer working with the column.

179
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,240
And when it is stop it is in the negative direction.

180
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,870
So minus one and we are going to push top to the side.

181
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,020
So.

182
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,280
Right.

183
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,310
All right, and finally, what do we want this function to return?

184
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,340
Now, keep in mind, this function has to return something.

185
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,890
It has to return either something or nothing.

186
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:28,710
And we know what those those two cases are and we are going to return sites.

187
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:37,590
So site it is either going to contain something based on all these pushes that we did here or it is

188
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,000
just going to be an empty array.

189
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,520
And we know in both conditions what we will do.

190
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,840
Right.

191
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:53,570
So let me just go over this, so this is square zero and square is the length.

192
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,970
All right.

193
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,470
And let me take a look.

194
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,490
This is option two that push options zero.

195
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,370
And this is options priority that Bush.

196
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,230
All right, right.

197
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,730
So let me reload this a couple of times.

198
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,190
There we go.

199
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,520
We don't have any errors, right?

200
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,510
That that's a good thing.

201
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:12,900
Always.

202
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,430
Now, let's go ahead and let's go to toe to toe with the computer.

203
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,590
And let's see if our A.I. requires any more finishing touches.

204
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,500
OK, let me grab that line.

205
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,040
There we go.

206
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,490
So now it is at the this is going to be our.

207
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:43,930
Second priority were the eyes selecting free sites where we provided it with the coordinates, remember,

208
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,180
and it is random, that's why it's like all over the place.

209
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,520
And this is also second priority, where it selected a square that has already won site.

210
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,100
Oh, there we go.

211
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,720
OK, we need to keep keep an eye on the.

212
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,350
OK, perfect.

213
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,100
So far.

214
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,250
Okey doke.

215
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,320
Let's put one here, one there.

216
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,010
I'm just going to close the path there.

217
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,030
So so far, the air hasn't done any mistake, right?

218
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,940
So if I closed the air is going to score with this, I don't think I'm going to I'm going to keep this

219
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,130
because this is actually a good move.

220
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,510
I'm going to keep it for myself.

221
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,790
We're going to see if the.

222
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,230
I knows that that's.

223
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,070
Oh, there we go.

224
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,420
The air.

225
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,260
I just got it.

226
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,680
So this is way more powerful than what we had.

227
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,970
So if I grabbed that or the other one doesn't matter.

228
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,200
Right, so I'm just going to grab it.

229
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,830
There we go.

230
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:14,570
They did that and the I got that one and I think I'm going to have to give the air some points because

231
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,850
all of them have two sides completed.

232
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,630
So this is going to be six points, four points, three points, so this is the smallest.

233
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,000
This is five.

234
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,900
This is three, four, five, six, seven.

235
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,040
Wow, that's big.

236
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:38,500
So if I give this one to, the idea is going to give me so I'm going to have one eye then.

237
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,860
One, two, three, four, five.

238
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,520
I think eventually the guy's going to win because of how this game actually works.

239
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,000
So let's go ahead.

240
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,260
There we go.

241
00:16:52,630 --> 00:17:00,160
The FBI gave me these points I'm going to give him for so he will have to he or she I don't know what

242
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,930
what that is, we'll have to give me one of those three go.

243
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,290
So.

244
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,050
Oh, they I actually won.

245
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,079
Because I'm 12, this is six, six plus seven, there's is going to be 13.

246
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,630
So you can see that this is pretty formidable, right, and computer one, I'm going to go one more

247
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,430
round with this.

248
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,980
I was just noticing there and I know that DEA is working fine.

249
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,070
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to mess around with this EHI.

250
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,590
Right.

251
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,770
So I'm going to try to make it to and to get it to make a mistake.

252
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,470
Purrfect.

253
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,020
If I don't do any mistake myself on the way.

254
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,850
O kay.

255
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,700
Let me put one here.

256
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,980
One from here.

257
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,760
All right, so there we go.

258
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,200
Pretty powerful ally, right, there we go.

259
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,010
So this is the first one that they gave us.

260
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,660
Now, let's check out if the there was there was another choice and if the idea could give me these

261
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,850
three points with the choice to give me more.

262
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,150
That's a oh, yeah, I missed this.

263
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,020
I don't know why.

264
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,530
Let's take a look at it.

265
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,410
I'm going to grab that.

266
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,720
OK, it was pretty intense.

267
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, so it's.

268
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,840
Going to be like that, I'm going to give you two points and you will have to give me all of this.

269
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,480
Perfect.

270
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:50,610
So this is this time with, like a lot of difference I want and this is going to be the last time I'm

271
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,620
not going to make you watch any further.

272
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,770
We are going to see that if the eyes.

273
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,070
Yes, sort of following me.

274
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,930
No, it is not.

275
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,940
That's what I want to hear from.

276
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,280
Let's see if the air grabs that idea.

277
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,720
I did so first priority is working splendidly.

278
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,070
Okey dokey, so let me put one here, there.

279
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,670
It doesn't matter where I put the ads, the score.

280
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,710
I mean, there are clearly these two options here.

281
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,650
I mean, it is clear that the air requires some touches.

282
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,130
But, hmm, the I did this one.

283
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,470
But still, I mean, this is like a powerfully high.

284
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,410
It is giving away a whole lot of points, the.

285
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:59,810
Let me just reload the page, just go over the we have we have our options, we have our options, we

286
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:08,360
have pushed the square squares and sides to that, to our second priority.

287
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,980
And it's basically always the problem with the second priority.

288
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,520
So let's go ahead and it's actually check out the sites function.

289
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,280
So for the left, if square that side bottom.

290
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,820
Oh, that's why Diaz is acting funky.

291
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,070
It's because all of these are bottom.

292
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,440
They should be different.

293
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,160
So I thought there was something wrong with the A.I. So it is left.

294
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,540
That's why they even even with that, the I managed to beat me.

295
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,580
So if we correct this problem.

296
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,850
So we have right, right, left, left.

297
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,820
Bottom, bottom and top, top, so let's save it.

298
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,770
OK, already I can feel the A.I. being more powerful.

299
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,150
OK, let's try to beat it.

300
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,070
You can see it's acting more confidently.

301
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,770
I could I can tell.

302
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,950
OK, I can see it's.

303
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,810
Very, very good.

304
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,510
Oh, you can see that the edge just got it.

305
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,330
It was my mistake in the air.

306
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:16,930
I got it.

307
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,120
Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.

308
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,700
Perfect words, can I put it here?

309
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,150
Yep.

310
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,710
And very, very confident.

311
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,500
So I think I think I will have to give him some points or her.

312
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:44,790
I God, I wish it is whatever, I'm not going to finish that sentence, so if I give it this one, is

313
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,360
there any possibility for me to get out of this now?

314
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,870
Yeah, see, now this is the power of this.

315
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,190
It just gave me one instead of giving me, like, a whole bunch.

316
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,160
Now, this is going to be very difficult to beat.

317
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,720
So I'm going to give you two hopefully.

318
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,970
And probably it's going to give me.

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,340
Oh, did I miss that?

320
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,320
Oops, well, my problem.

321
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,240
Wow, this is way ahead of me, so I'm going to give you these tools.

322
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,130
You will have to give me five more.

323
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah.

324
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,880
Oops, I made a mistake.

325
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,810
Now, this is not fair, I'm just going to relive this.

326
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:37,430
Well, I didn't have to reloaded it with reload itself, so let's see what we can do here.

327
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,190
So I would like to shorten our paths.

328
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,770
Right.

329
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,240
And I would like to create one here.

330
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,550
Short paths.

331
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,310
Just to not give away too many points.

332
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,430
Perfect, the ice trying to do something sketchy.

333
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,690
OK.

334
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,330
Mm hmm.

335
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,440
There we go.

336
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,730
So I'm going to put out there and scrub this one.

337
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,730
Let's see, so this one, it doesn't matter.

338
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,530
So I think I can select this one.

339
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,510
Yeah, so there we go.

340
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,460
So the air had no other choice but to give me some points.

341
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,700
I'm going to give you one, buddy.

342
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,510
Yeah.

343
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,940
I am about.

344
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,030
So one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five.

345
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,180
Wow, that's a lot.

346
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,360
So they will give me this one and I'm going to give give the eye this one.

347
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,170
And if no, not that one.

348
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,350
Actually, I could give the I'm going to beat this.

349
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,870
Oh.

350
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,650
Oh, well, I didn't see that coming.

351
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,030
It's been from.

352
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,030
Wow, so powerful.

353
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,510
I did not see that coming.

354
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,000
You know what, I'm going to do it once more.

355
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,130
I mean, we are basically done here.

356
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,140
So you could I mean, technically, you could skip to our next lecture, but I have to beat this on

357
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,600
camera.

358
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,100
This is like a fight for all of humanity.

359
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,700
I'm going to be more careful.

360
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:33,790
I mean, I don't remember the last time that I played this game, so it is it does really require you

361
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,570
to think.

362
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,870
OK, so I'm going to close this path.

363
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,890
Close this path as well, close this one.

364
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,020
Others close that one, so.

365
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,620
Let's see.

366
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,750
No, not this one, so this is too this is still a lie.

367
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:11,150
I know this is three, actually, and if I close that path, that is going to give given to but I'm

368
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,190
not going to give them to.

369
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm going to give them one.

370
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Oh, so there we go.

371
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,950
We got four out of it.

372
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,330
So.

373
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,320
Spotted here.

374
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,280
It's a pretty smart so.

375
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:34,840
It is definitely up to something, so if I eventually if I give him this, he is going to give me this

376
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,700
one, two, three, four, five, six, and I'm going to have to give him this.

377
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,110
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

378
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,840
So there is going to be ten plus to 12.

379
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,910
Either way, I'm going to win.

380
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,730
All right, so the I chose to give me this one perfect.

381
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:04,450
Either way, I'm going to win, buddy, so that's it for this chapter and for this project.

382
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,610
See you guys in the next one, I hope.

383
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,740
I really hope that you have enjoyed this one.

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,150
This was one of those really awesome games that we created here.

385
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,400
See you guys then.
