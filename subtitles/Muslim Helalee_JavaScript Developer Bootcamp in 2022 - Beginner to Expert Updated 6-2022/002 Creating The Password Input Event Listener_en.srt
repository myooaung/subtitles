00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:08,680
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create the password input event listener.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:18,520
All right, so first things first, we need to select three things from the e-mail, and it's those

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,020
three things that we have created.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,610
So we need to select, B, strengthen.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,980
The text input and the password check, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say const consed and

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,250
I'm going to call it string thir.

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,300
All right, and I'm going to say document that query selector.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,070
Query selector, and it has a class of strength.

9
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,170
Right, and after that.

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:59,390
What I want to do is I want to select the password input, surpass password input.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,310
OK, so the password input, we are going to select it using the type, so we are going to say it is

12
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,030
an input.

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,790
And it has a type.

14
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,710
Make sure you spell it correctly so it has a type of what is the type of this?

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,250
It has a type of pass.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,320
No, it doesn't have a type of password.

17
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,800
The reason that I didn't provided with the type of password is because if I type something, you're

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,940
not going to be able to see it.

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,520
So it just has a type of text.

20
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,800
So we are going to pass and text messaging.

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,050
This is smaller.

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,640
I think we can work with that.

23
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,980
OK, and finally, we have our password check, so.

24
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:55,260
I'm going to say password check and the class name is going to be password dash check.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,750
Now we have selected our items, the event, the input event.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,940
Of course, it is going to be on the input.

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,780
So we are going to say password, not check input dart at a wellness center.

28
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,210
And we are listening for what?

29
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,320
For an input event.

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,000
And when the input event is fired, we want to run a function.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,030
So it is update strength.

32
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,040
This is the update.

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,240
Strength, function, strength.

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,790
Right.

35
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,710
Which I'm not going to create here.

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,770
I'm going to created as a stand alone function declaration.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,040
So I'm going to say function, update, strengthen.

38
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,240
Now, they're not going to be any parameter.

39
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,750
All right.

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,250
But what I'm going to do here inside, first things first, I want to create an assessment variable.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,170
Now, the assessment variable is going to assess our password.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,940
We are going to have multiple different assessments, assets, assessment functions for for example,

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,510
for the length of the password, for the whether the password has uppercase characters, lowercase characters,

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,100
whether it includes numbers or special characters.

45
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,370
So each one of those is going to be a different assessment function.

46
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:20,210
So in here, what I want to do is I want to create I want to call a function that is calculate password,

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,990
pass word strength.

48
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,080
All right.

49
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,420
So this is going to be a different function that we are going to call here inside this and we are going

50
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,210
to put the value inside this variable.

51
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:43,160
And this calculate password strength is going to be the function that is going to that is going to house

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,780
all of our assessments.

53
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,380
Right.

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,170
So from this function, what do I need?

55
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,300
I want to grab the password.

56
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,520
Input value, so whatever the password input that value is, I want to grab it from this function and

57
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,440
then let's go ahead.

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,810
And that's, for example, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say let strength write, not strengthen.

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,290
I'm going to say that strength and I'm going to set it equal to 100.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm going to comment it out for now.

61
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:22,230
So now what I want to do here is that I want to grab our password check.

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,430
And I want to say in our e-mail, all right, first off, I want to set it to nothing in case there

63
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,500
is something we don't want to put into anything.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,340
The passwords check is this area right here.

65
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:43,110
And after that, we are going to grab our assessment because this calculate password function, password

66
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,350
strength function is going to give us more than one assessment.

67
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,440
Or to be accurate, it is going to give us an array so we can call for each method on it.

68
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:03,570
And each time we call this method, we are going to pass in an assessment, so assess and I should probably

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,030
write this as assessments and this one, this is going to be an individual assessment.

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,140
And what do we want to do with this assessment?

71
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,630
So first things first.

72
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,650
We want to check if the assessment is if the assessment is zero, if the user hasn't put and hasn't

73
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,690
hasn't typed anything inside that password password fields, if the user doesn't type anything, we

74
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,450
just want to return from this function.

75
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,390
We don't want to run it.

76
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:30,950
All right.

77
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,860
So we need to always check for whether there is something.

78
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,660
So I'm going to say equal to null.

79
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,590
If it is null, then we want to return.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,140
So simply we are going to say return otherwise.

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,390
So let's come down here.

82
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,310
Otherwise, what do I want to do, I want to grab our strength.

83
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:00,410
Strength and I want to remove from it the strength.

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,880
All right, the based on the assessment.

85
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,320
So this is how it is going to work.

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,810
We are going to receive an assessment and then we are going to pass in a strength that we lose, which

87
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm going to call it strength lost.

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,700
And I want to remove it from that strength variable that we have created here.

89
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,010
So the strength is going to be originally 100 when the strength is originally 100.

90
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,230
Now we are going the other direction with this application.

91
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,980
So we are not going to start from zero to 100.

92
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,850
We're actually encoding.

93
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,980
We are going to start from 100 to zero.

94
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,880
So we assume that the strength is 100 when there is no password and when the user types something,

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,190
the strength is going to get decreased and we are going to increase it once more when the password has

96
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,110
insufficient, sufficient assessments.

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,650
So we are going to set assessment date strength.

98
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,380
Strength lost, we have not created the strength lost we are going to create.

99
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,990
Don't worry about it may not be in this lecture, but we are definitely going to create it in the next

100
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,440
lecture.

101
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,490
And then we are going to say, conse, let's create another variable.

102
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:23,680
And then now I want to create the password check aliment, the elements that you sign here, those paragraphs

103
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,410
for which we already have the stuff.

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,930
So I'm going to call it WD check e l element and I'm going to call it document that creates element.

105
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,470
We know how we can create an element, so create element.

106
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,550
What is the element.

107
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,530
Just passing the tag name, which is P and then what do we want to do.

108
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:51,390
We want to grab that P WD check element and we want to say enter HTML.

109
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,680
What is the inner ystem are going to be the average HTML is going to be our assessment.

110
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,880
Dot, from the assessment, what do we want to grab?

111
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,180
So now the assessment so far, we know that it has one property, it has strength lost.

112
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,690
What is the assessments?

113
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,670
Other property that it is going to have?

114
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,520
It is going to be W.D. Check.

115
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,530
It is going to have a check property as well.

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,770
We are going to create a don't worry about it.

117
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,420
So it is not E-L.

118
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,200
We are just going to pass it p check.

119
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,890
All right.

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,880
And then we are going to grab our passport check and we are going to have a child.

121
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,090
Whenever you create an element, you have to find a parent that adopts that element.

122
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,190
So what do we want to pass?

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,409
And we want to pass in the check p.

124
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,330
D check password's check aliment.

125
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,760
Right.

126
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,360
And finally.

127
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,410
So now this for each is completed.

128
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:00,560
Each time the user does something into something, enters and input, all these assessments are going

129
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:00,950
to run.

130
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,540
They're going to take a look at them.

131
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,170
All right.

132
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,870
And we are going to grab this strengthen.

133
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:15,290
I say style, OK, dot set property, so set property.

134
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:25,430
What is that we want to set the property to say, don't you remember that we have a a custom Cyesis

135
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,470
variable and it is right here.

136
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,240
And what is the variable name?

137
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,310
The variable name is strength amount.

138
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:39,380
We want the value for this strength amount to initially be zero and then we want to dynamically change

139
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,300
it based on something the user type.

140
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,370
So I'm going to grab that.

141
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,470
So we are going to put it right here and I'm going to sit I'm going to put it there, and then we are

142
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,920
going to pass on our strength.

143
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,430
Now, the strength variable is created here.

144
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,090
We have we have subtracted from the strength, the strength that we have lost.

145
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,720
All right.

146
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:07,030
And then we want to pass that strength, value for which property that we have for the strength amount

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,580
property that we have already created here.

148
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,690
So that value is going to come right here and is going to be multiplied by the one percent and then

149
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,710
we are going to get our high.

150
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,560
This is how we get this dynamic right.

151
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,620
So we are done with this function.

152
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,260
I know it is not working.

153
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,630
It's not going to do anything.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,620
In fact, let's go let's open this council and let's see if we have any errors.

155
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,750
So far, we don't have any errors and should make this one a little bit bigger.

156
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,890
And let's zoom out a little bit and.

157
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,240
Okay.

158
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,120
So now everything should be working properly, zoom up and go up.

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,610
So what we are going to do in the next lecture is working to create this calculate password's strength

160
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,210
function.

161
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:59,480
And after that, we are going to pass in our assessments function.

162
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:06,050
So again, we have different assessments for different criteria of this application that we want for

163
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,840
this form input that we want, which we are going to start creating in the next slide, starting next

164
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,290
lecture.

165
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,110
And all of them, all of these I'm going to be explaining along the way.

166
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,720
So that's it for this lecture.

167
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,390
See you guys in the next one.
