00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.380
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.220
In this lecture, we are going to apply the currency conversion and the exchange rate concepts that

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.560
we talked about in the previous lecture.

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.280
All right, so I'm back and the electricity is back, and it took took a while, it took a few hours.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.320
So let's start where were we?

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.400
So what are we going to do?

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.040
The way that I'm going to be creating this application is first we are going to fetch the data and then

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.759
we are going to do some meaningful things with it.

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:45.820
So we are going to say async function and I'm going to create a function name that is get X X exchange

10
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.700
rate, because when we have the exchange rate, we can basically grab our amount and multiply it by

11
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.150
the with the exchange rate and then we are going to get the exchanged amount and this is going to grab

12
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.590
two parameters.

13
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.000
So the first one is going to be from currency.

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.690
So from currency, the currency that we want to convert from and to currency, the currency that we

15
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.930
want to convert currency, the currency that we want to convert to.

16
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.570
Right.

17
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.950
Let's create our response const response.

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.530
Now, this is very familiar to you response.

19
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.850
And we are going to wait until the response come on a wait until the response is completed and then

20
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.810
we are going to store it.

21
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.360
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to paste and that you are here.

22
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.150
OK, just go ahead and use this and it should work.

23
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.700
And now let's go ahead and let's convert their response into something that is meaningful.

24
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.440
So I'm going to say currency data and we are going to say await a response.

25
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.740
Jason?

26
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.039
And now let's cancel council luggage so we can see what it is that we are getting council currency data,

27
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.550
save it.

28
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.620
So this is where we're working.

29
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.270
I'm going to put it on the side.

30
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.610
I'm going to bring it way over here to go to console.

31
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.060
I'm going to zoom in and reload.

32
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.420
Oh, we have not called the function.

33
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.990
We need to call that function rights to be able to get something.

34
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.450
So we are going to say get exchange rate.

35
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.630
Let's just do that.

36
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.240
And hopefully we are going to get something right.

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.160
So we get this.

38
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.000
And you can see inside the rates is where we are interest.

39
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.090
And you can see the base is right here.

40
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.310
So I'm going to zoom and I'm sure you can see it right now.

41
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.980
The base is the base is euro.

42
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.470
And this is what's making the problems of all the things that we covered in the previous lecture.

43
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.260
So we get all that.

44
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.780
I think this is different point.

45
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.760
No, no, it's the same because it's euro.

46
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.920
How could that be different?

47
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.230
Right.

48
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.900
So everything is right here.

49
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:16.710
So if I were to say, hmm, that rates this is going to give us all the rates that we need right now.

50
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.870
We get all the rates.

51
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.140
This is an object.

52
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.150
This is an object.

53
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.230
Keep that in mind.

54
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.800
This is this is not an array.

55
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.340
So we cannot loop over it to get the this right.

56
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.850
But what it gives us is it gives us currency codes.

57
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.770
These are valid currency codes.

58
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.130
Right.

59
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.060
And we use that inside our application.

60
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.000
So.

61
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.800
What I'm going to do is I'm going to store these currency codes, so not to do this over and over,

62
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:55.460
we are going to say CONSED currency, I'm going to name it currency rates, currency rates, and I'm

63
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.020
going to say do this.

64
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.890
All right.

65
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.780
Now you can see that I think I've not said it.

66
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.210
Yeah, we have a lot different currency.

67
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.830
So if I were to say currency, if I just can't slug this one more time, that's a log currency rates

68
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.500
rates.

69
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.550
If I say currency rates that offend it is going to give me the currency rate for Afghani or Afghani

70
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.030
based on euro.

71
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.730
Right.

72
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.620
So this is a one euro is this many Afghanis.

73
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.810
So one Afghani is in 91, 19th of a euro because one euro is 90.

74
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.780
So one bank has 90 apples.

75
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.120
One apple is one ninetieth part of that back.

76
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.820
All right.

77
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.840
Think of it like that.

78
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.840
I'm not sure if that was a good analogy, but I think you get the idea.

79
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.300
The reason that I've done this is we do not want a hard code.

80
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.650
The rate that we want to get exactly like we do not want to hard codebase.

81
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.000
We do not want a hard code.

82
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.670
The value that we want to convert to, to or converted from, we do not want to Harkov value.

83
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:19.320
So instead of writing Afan or USD or Sead or Ayuda or INR PiquÃ© or whatever the currency code is, instead

84
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:28.160
of writing that specifically here, we want to we want to let the user have that, uh, freedom to write.

85
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.000
That's why we have UI here.

86
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.860
So we are not going to hard code that.

87
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.750
So what I'm going to do here as I want to grasp the basic currency so we know how we can grab it.

88
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.930
So what is the basic currency?

89
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.820
We first off, we say one multiplied by whatever currency that has been entered by the user.

90
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.510
So currency.

91
00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.690
Currency rate, currency rates, so the currency rates is going to give us whatever currency has been

92
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.490
inserted by the user, right.

93
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.430
And we know what it's going to give us the rates.

94
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.720
So what is that specific rate that we are we are looking for?

95
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.140
Because currency rates give give us that big object.

96
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.430
What is that specific?

97
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.150
That specific one is going to be from currency that we have passed right here because the user is going

98
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.990
to specify.

99
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.320
So whatever that is, we just we divide and we just say one divided by that.

100
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.310
Right.

101
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.180
And now we get our exchange rate.

102
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.230
We did this in our previous and previous videos.

103
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.140
I'm not going to go into too much detail, so I'm just going to say exchange rate.

104
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.780
What is the actual exchange rate that we get?

105
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.060
We must apply to remember, we multiply the euro by USD, so we want to play it.

106
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.320
We grab the best currency and we multiply it to current rates.

107
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.490
And what is the thing that we are interested in?

108
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.740
The current rates to currency.

109
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.500
Now we get the better.

110
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.980
We get the currency.

111
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.820
OK, so this is incorrect as well.

112
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:20.350
Currency, let's in C so we get the base of the currency that we want to convert it from and then we

113
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.940
say one divided by that.

114
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.900
And what we get is and then we multiply based currency, which is that that we just got from the division.

115
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.790
And we must apply to the currency rate of whatever currency that we want to convert it to.

116
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.100
It's exactly like that.

117
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:44.110
We converted from we converted the currency rate of the Afghani from euro to dollar, and then we use

118
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.250
that exchange rate to calculate what is the exchange amount.

119
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.020
And then I basically, I want to say a return exchange rate.

120
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.790
So we are done with this function and now technically it should work.

121
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.540
So if I were to say afan to USD.

122
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.110
We should get we should get zero point zero one three or something like that.

123
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:17.830
So if I come here and we are not logging anything right, are we?

124
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.510
No, we are not.

125
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.620
So let's put it inside the console lock.

126
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.690
You're not logging anything.

127
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.330
So I'm just going to say console that log so that hopefully it works.

128
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.440
Yep.

129
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.630
So we get the promises pending.

130
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:42.140
Oh, I am so sorry about this, because this entire thing returns a promise we cannot just it.

131
00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:55.480
So what we can do is we can say that then like result and we can say a result and let's just cancel

132
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.110
the results.

133
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.070
Let's see what it is going to give us a log result.

134
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.590
Result we get this so you can see that we got that.

135
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.240
So zero point zero one three is what we calculated in the previous lecture.

136
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.960
So we were success.

137
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.430
We were able to successfully grab it.

138
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.960
Now I want to create our first customer in this lecture as well.

139
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.070
So what what it is that I want to create now, we know all the time.

140
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:30.730
We know for sure that the exchange rate is going to be a number if for any reason it is not a number.

141
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.810
I want to throw an error.

142
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.390
So there is a method that I can use and that is is not a number.

143
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:46.720
So if exchange rate, exchange rate is not a number for now, what I want to do is I just want to say,

144
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.860
Consol, we are going to customize this error later.

145
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.000
But for now, I just want to say council log atter.

146
00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:04.550
Right, so let's see, so now we don't see the error, but if I change this aph into UFF and save it,

147
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.960
we get our error and it says, no, no, see, this is our error.

148
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.440
We are going to customize this area later.

149
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:20.060
Right, but for now, we are going to stick with it and that's it for this lecture in the next lecture.

150
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:26.280
What I'm going to do as a we are actually, if you understood this, we are you could say we are we

151
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.400
are halfway done with this with this project.

152
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:35.430
The only thing that remaining is we need to convert the actual currency.

153
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.200
We need to we need to be able to pass in numbers and convert the currency.

154
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:46.760
And then we just need to do something useful with it, like put it in the UI.

155
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:47.400
Right.

156
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.850
So that's it for this lecture.

157
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.700
See you guys in the next one.
