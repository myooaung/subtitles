00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.070
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.590
In this lecture, we are going to go ahead and make the gallery clickable.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.850
All right, so we are going to go ahead inside the Abdel-Aziz file and I'm going to go ahead and I'm

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.720
going to create a constant where I just go ahead and grab the current image class that we have created.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.060
This class is only provided to the image that is in the center.

6
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.520
That is the preview image.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.390
Right.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.640
So let's go ahead and describe that class query selector and we are going to put in a dot and we are

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.200
going to say current IMG.

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.210
All right.

11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.030
So we have successfully selected this class.

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.180
And the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab all of the images at the same time.

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.010
And I want to be able to store it inside a a an array, which which actually is a node list, but it

14
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.550
looks like an array, so it behaves like an array.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.700
So I'm going to say const images, I'm just going to call it images and we're going to document that

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.480
query selector all.

17
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.820
So I'm going to grab and I'm going to say all Dasch images.

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.680
And then from there I'm just going to grab the images.

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.150
So the first one is a class selector and the second one is an element selector because inside the query

20
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
selector quotes, we can do any valid Cyesis selector.

21
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.350
That's the good part of this query selector.

22
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.700
So I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to grab all of the images and I'm going to do a for each loop on

23
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.920
them.

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.650
All right.

25
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.920
And each time the loop runs, I want to run a function and that function is going to have an image as

26
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.910
a parameter.

27
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.660
Right.

28
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.460
Which is also the loop variable.

29
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.880
And we are going to grab our image and we are going to add eventless here because we could do this or

30
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.150
we could grab all of our 10 images individually and we could add an event listener to them individually

31
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.350
or separately.

32
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.320
But this way it is like a much better way.

33
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.670
And that's why we don't have to repeat ourselves ten times, like nine unnecessary times.

34
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.520
So what is the event that we're listening for?

35
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.060
It is going to be a click and when the click happens, we want to capture the event object.

36
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.980
So let's go ahead and check something out.

37
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.500
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and cancel log E, right.

38
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.510
We have done cancel log E a lot and we know what this is going to give us.

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.420
But still, I just want to do it again.

40
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.760
So if I just go ahead and click on this, we are going to get a mouse event.

41
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.840
So if I bring this up and if I click here, if we come to Target, I'm looking for the source because

42
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.640
whenever we click on any of these images, we're basically switching the source.

43
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.560
So let's go down.

44
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.300
Let's see where the source is.

45
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.340
Uh huh.

46
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.820
Oh, it's it's not here, but I think it is this one, this is what we are looking, looking for.

47
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.290
So where is it?

48
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.090
It is this current source, this is the source.

49
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.950
We are basically looking for this image slash three.

50
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.600
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead to our code and I'm going to say Dot.

51
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.090
The target.

52
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:44.950
Target, dot, sirc, save it, and if I click on this, we get the source for that image where that

53
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.970
image is located.

54
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.390
All right.

55
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.830
So we get the source.

56
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.640
If I click on this and if I expand this week, we can see that we are inside our images folder and we

57
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.240
have clicked on the image number four.

58
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.960
So we have successfully selected our images.

59
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.920
Now, what I want to do is I'm just going to go ahead and grab this, either target the source and I'm

60
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.910
going to remove this and I'm going to say current damage that source.

61
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.470
So the source of the current image is going to be fed by this eat target, that source.

62
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.570
So whichever picture or image it is that the user has clicked on, this is going to grab the source

63
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.300
of that image and this equal sign is going to provide it to this current source.

64
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.520
So only with this line if I just save it and if I come here and close this.

65
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.160
So if I click, we can see that this is probably working because we were just switching of the source

66
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.940
for the image.

67
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.650
But there is one more thing remaining and that is that smooth behavior that we have.

68
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.460
So I'm just going to say current image dot classless.

69
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.280
So now I'm going to go ahead and add that class.

70
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.380
And the classes, an inmate dash, I save it.

71
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.490
Come here.

72
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:11.100
So if I added, we can see that it had had like a unappeased effect, but if I click on the other ones,

73
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.230
none of them have, because that class is added to the first image, the that the user has clicked on.

74
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.800
So that is not how this gallery works.

75
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.480
We want that class to be added to that image that the user has clicked on.

76
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:34.800
But also we want we want to remove that class when the user clicks on another image and we want to add

77
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.720
it to that image, to it, to the second image.

78
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.820
So what I'm going to do is we are going to create a set time out.

79
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.750
Function, all right, and I'm going to say function in here, right, and what is this function going

80
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.110
to do?

81
00:05:49.470 --> 00:06:00.810
This function is just going to go ahead and after 400 and after 400 milliseconds, it is going to remove

82
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.500
that class from whichever image it is that has that class.

83
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:14.390
So when the class is added, we are going to remove that class after point four seconds, like after

84
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.910
less than half a second.

85
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.810
So immediately it means like we are going to remove it immediately from that image so we can add it

86
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.830
to another image.

87
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.570
So current image that classless does not remove.

88
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.560
It is an inmate, Dush IMGs, so I'm going to go over this line one more time.

89
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.360
We have added that the current the animated images class to whichever.

90
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:51.460
Imageries that has been cloaked, but in order to switch this class between between all of the images,

91
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.640
what I what I have to do is I have to be able to remove it from that same image as well, remove that

92
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.090
clause.

93
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.820
So I don't want to remove it immediately.

94
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:08.020
Like, if I don't provide it inside this Satima function, this line is going to run immediately.

95
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.750
It means like it means like this.

96
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:19.130
So the current the animate images class is added and is removed almost at the same time.

97
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.530
That's not what we want.

98
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.660
We want there to be some gap.

99
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.420
And that gap is point four seconds.

100
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.030
So we are the images.

101
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.190
This animated is class and after point four seconds, we remove it.

102
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.240
So that gap is going to give us that smooth behavior.

103
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.540
So if I click on this, we can see the classes because this has been almost three, four seconds.

104
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.600
The class has already been removed, so removed, removed, removed, because at this point, four seconds

105
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:57.000
it is removed like almost immediately, but not at the same time as the class is added.

106
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.920
We don't want to add and remove classes at the same time.

107
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.420
We want there to be some gap.

108
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:08.390
And in case you're wondering where this 400 comes from, just said it to whatever the animation time

109
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:14.990
is, if you want to end up with a smooth experience, otherwise you're going to see a jump kind of opacity

110
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.560
change.

111
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.250
All right.

112
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.490
So that's it for this project and for this chapter.

113
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.280
See you guys in the next one.
