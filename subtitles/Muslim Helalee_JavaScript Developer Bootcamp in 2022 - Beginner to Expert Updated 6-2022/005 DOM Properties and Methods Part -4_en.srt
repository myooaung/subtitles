00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,360
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,590
In this next year, we're going to talk about even more dumb methods.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,140
All right, so the door method four and five, they are kind of related.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,150
All right.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,120
And they are creative element and append child.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:19,900
All right.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:28,900
So we have to we have a covered how we can create an element through inner HTML, but there is actually

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,920
an easier way.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,510
Right.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,140
So this this this approach requires three steps.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,380
So the first step in the first step, we create an element.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,870
So let's go ahead.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,130
Now, what do I want to create before just diving into the code?

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,450
I want to create.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:55,260
I want to create another item, I want to add another item to this list so we have loyal, funny and

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,880
good company.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,240
I could go ahead and added in the HTML, but then why am I then why are you studying JavaScript if we

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,980
can just do it through e-mail?

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,020
Now this is why.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,900
Because we want to do it dynamically.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,720
That's why we are going to do it through JavaScript.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,190
All right.

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,800
So what I'm going to name this new element is going to be new item.

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,430
This is actually a better way than that.

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,960
Are going to say document.

26
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,180
We are going to go into document and we are going to say create element.

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:26,910
That's it.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,310
So what is the element that you want to create?

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,090
It's ANELLI.

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,060
That's how simple it is.

31
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,540
And now Anelli has been created.

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,670
Now, it's nowhere to be found, of course, but the line has been created.

33
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,050
All right.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,090
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to do to console locks to console and

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
not console luck.

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,640
So the first console is going to be the Diaa.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,810
And we are going to take a look at the new item.

38
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,290
So what?

39
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:02,010
It is an ally, of course, but when I click on it, we are going to see all these properties and methods

40
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,229
that we can apply exactly like any other HDMI element that we have.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,190
And it here it says e-mail.

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,270
And so we have created successfully an element.

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,990
So after that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say Konzerthaus lock new item.

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,330
Let's take a look at it, what it is.

45
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,760
So now we have successfully created an ally and this method is better because you don't have to worry

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,140
about the opening tag, the closing tag, whether an element has an opening tag or not.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,010
This this way is better.

48
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,770
We let JavaScript decide what element it is.

49
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,030
We just give it the name.

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,920
If you want to create an ally, just give it the element name, OK?

51
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,610
You can create by element names.

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,920
You want to create a you'll just give it to you.

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,910
Well, that said.

54
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,590
So this is the first step in the first step.

55
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,990
I'm just going to go ahead and name it.

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:04,060
So in the first step, the element is created in the second step.

57
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,440
What do we have in the second step?

58
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,290
The element is given content or text.

59
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,030
The element is.

60
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:21,710
Given content slash text, right, because now you can see that this element is completely empty.

61
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,230
There is nothing inside of it.

62
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:30,050
So what we are going to do is we are going to say new item, dot, inner text.

63
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,390
This is where the inner text comes in.

64
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,990
And you might ask, OK, why don't you use inner content?

65
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:43,420
Because inner content is going to show the content as though it is inside the document.

66
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,650
And we do not want that.

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,560
We want to show the content as though it is inside the Web page, because ultimately when we create

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,380
a new item, we want to showcase it inside the browser.

69
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,050
So why don't we start there?

70
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,900
So the enter content is cute, super simple.

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,620
Now you guys can see that it has updated and now it has a content inside of it.

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,090
So we have successfully created another ally and we have given it some content.

73
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,279
I'm just going to go ahead and zoom and this console a bit more.

74
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:25,260
So this is better visible now and now it is the turn of the third step and the final.

75
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,060
Now we need a parent for the element to housesit in.

76
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,840
We need a parent for the element to append it to.

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,950
All right, now we want we need we need a parent to adopt.

78
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,480
Adopt this element.

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,050
That's how simple it is.

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,550
We have created the element, we do have a child.

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,800
Now we have to give it to a foster home.

82
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,900
All right.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,230
So now let's go ahead and let's grab our, you know, items.

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,320
They are adopted by us, right.

85
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,780
So let's grab our you and let's make it adopt this elai.

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,130
And this is like fully in our control.

87
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,140
So first off, let's go ahead and let's find the parent.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,850
All right.

89
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,990
So we are going to look for the parent.

90
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,600
OK, like like you are in like an adoption agency.

91
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,870
They look for parents like we are looking for a parent.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,420
And let's go ahead and let's find a parent.

93
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,270
But the difference is this is way easier, OK, with computer.

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,260
And real world is really difficult.

95
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,190
All right, so we have query selector and now let's go ahead and scrub the parent.

96
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,040
It is as simple as this.

97
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:49,030
Now we have grabbed the parent and now let's go ahead and let's introduce the child to the parent and

98
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,050
give it to the parent.

99
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,650
And that's it.

100
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:51,910
All right.

101
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,610
And then we are going to say list dot, append child.

102
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,740
What is the child that we want to spend?

103
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,890
It is the new item.

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,230
It is Billy Batson, save it, and now here we go, it's as cute, see, and it doesn't matter how many

105
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,330
times you refresh that, it's always going to be there.

106
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,270
It is always going to be there.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,880
And now we have that's why Method four and Method five were related to one another.

108
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,700
We have successfully created another element.

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,010
All right, so this is going to be it for this lecture in the next lecture, we are going to talk about

110
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,800
different, other, different ways that we can insert e-mail elements into our Web pages dynamically.

111
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,910
See you guys in the next lecture.
