00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,200
Hi, everyone, in this chapter, we will be creating a tic tac toe game.

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:17,200
All right, so what is this game that we will be building, building here, if you're not familiar with

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,590
this, we have nine boxes here, right?

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,470
So we have a board that is three by three.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,060
Right.

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:33,700
And in this board, there are going to be two players, each of the players that completes three of

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:41,050
their, for example, symbols in a row, B, that horizontally, vertically or diagonally, they will

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,210
get they will win.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,570
All right.

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,850
So we are going to have OS and access for this game.

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:48,930
Right.

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,720
And so let's go ahead and let's actually play this.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,060
So the way it is going to be played is now this is a multiplayer game.

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,230
So it is there is not going to be any I'm just going to be two players playing.

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,510
So, for example, if you click, you're going to land in.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,349
Oh, for example.

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,120
Now, the first player is the OAP and then the X player is going to put one there.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,940
For example, the O puts a symbol here and then the Xbox One there.

19
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:23,380
And then whoever completes three in a row as this is going to say, wins and directly right after one

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,970
second it is going to reload.

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,880
You can't risk, for example, in the middle of playing, you can restart it through this button as

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,140
well.

23
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,310
And it is going to work.

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,350
It doesn't matter in which direction it is.

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,410
So I'm just going to place them, for example, diagonally.

26
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:47,470
Then you can say, oh, wins, it could be vertically, vertically or horizontally.

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,840
So let's put one vertically.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:59,010
Sort of horizontally, and you can see that it's going to reload the game after exactly one second after

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,580
the results are shown, then it is going to reload the game.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,460
Right.

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
So it's very, very simple.

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,570
And let's get to it.
