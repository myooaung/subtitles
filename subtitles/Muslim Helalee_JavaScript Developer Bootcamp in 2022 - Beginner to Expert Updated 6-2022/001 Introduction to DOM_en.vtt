00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.830
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.650
In this lecture, we are going to go over what document object model is.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.090
All right, so before starting this lecture, I have to say that.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.300
In order to succeed in the topic of document, object model and what it does for short, it's called

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.070
dumb, you should have intermediate level achievements, this knowledge.

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.250
And if you're interested, I do have two courses on the topic of e-mail and services.

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.180
You can go ahead and check him out.

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.260
All right.

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.200
So what is dumb or document?

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.590
Object.

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.880
Model what dumb links JavaScript to e-mail and access.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:50.510
Now HDMI on Cyesis when they are linked to the JavaScript JavaScript, they are converted to JS objects

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.470
and these objects have different properties.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.990
Right now, Dom is a structure representation of an HTML document.

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.890
We can use JavaScript to manipulate the domain.

16
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.320
The dumb is object oriented.

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.980
It means that all the nodes have sets of properties and methods.

18
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.590
Now we will work a ton in the DOM, so do not worry if anything is confusing for now.

19
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.310
Just know that Dom is the entry point of JavaScript getting linked to e-mail, Unsere says.

20
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.790
All right, so let's go ahead and let's check out, for example, in the consulate, what I'm going

21
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.950
to do is I'm just going to go ahead.

22
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.630
I'm going to say cancel the dinner and I'm going to provide it with a document.

23
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.680
Document, all right, and let's save it.

24
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.180
And this is what we get.

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.450
OK.

26
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.950
And in here we can see there is a lot of information.

27
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.170
And I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to increase.

28
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.240
This window.

29
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.280
All right, so now you guys can see that I'm just going to go ahead.

30
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.860
You know what?

31
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.550
I'm going to go for full screen.

32
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.170
All right.

33
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.690
So in here, we have a euro which says where the page is located, we have active element is the body,

34
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.420
which is the active element, and we have all our e-mail, all collections each we have e-mail had met

35
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.960
our title by the script, script viewport and met up.

36
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.070
And you guys can see that whenever I had document, no document is the deep part.

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.960
The document object model.

38
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.850
It means it grabs the document and it turns it, it converts it into objects.

39
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.500
Right.

40
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.020
And we can see all of them here.

41
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.000
They have an index.

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.730
This is a collection of an array.

43
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.310
Right.

44
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.230
And there is a lot of information.

45
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.700
We have our character set.

46
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.610
We have our child nodes which are which are legitimate.

47
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.510
And Estima.

48
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.070
And we can this is a report where the document is located and let's come down, let's look for something

49
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.840
which is and these are all the events, all the functions that we can apply when we are working with

50
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.200
them.

51
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.170
All right.

52
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.650
And we are going to work with with a lot of what a lot of these events with a lot of these functions

53
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.440
and methods throughout our projects.

54
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.370
Definitely.

55
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.750
And in here, it says this is an original document.

56
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.420
So this is actually what we are going to work with.

57
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.080
All right.

58
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.240
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to make this smaller and bring it here.

59
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.580
All right, so this is done right, and this is document, this is the final document inside the JavaScript.

60
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.940
So what about this time of document inside the document itself?

61
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.510
How can we link?

62
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:54.750
The document which we just saw to the document, which is the markup, so how can we link JavaScript,

63
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.190
object to the HTML document, that is what Dume is all about.

64
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.750
So dumb allows us to link the J.S. object to the HTML duck.

65
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.620
All right.

66
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.450
This is what JavaScript allows, what Dom allows us to do.

67
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.330
Now, how can we do that?

68
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.920
We can do that through two kinds of in two steps.

69
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.410
First, we select and then we manipulate.

70
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.890
All right, or we change or we take advantage of whatever you want to call it, whatever synonym you

71
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.490
want to call it.

72
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.160
So there are different selecting methods for Dume in the JavaScript.

73
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.720
We have talked about one of them in the last lecture of the.

74
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.750
Functions chapter.

75
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.320
And now we are going to dive deeper into them.

76
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.360
OK, so the first method that I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to talk about is getting selecting

77
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.900
methods.

78
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.500
All right.

79
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.260
Getting HTML elements by their class.

80
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:09.290
Now, from now onwards, we are going to tap into the unlimited potential of document object model of

81
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.070
JavaScript.

82
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.760
All right.

83
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.850
So so the first method is how we can select esteemable elements by their class.

84
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.550
So what I'm going to do is the first thing that I'm going to do before going deeper into this code is

85
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.150
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to paste in some HTML elements.

86
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.360
I'm just going to copy it and I'm going to pasted here.

87
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.970
So we have in each one we have a paragraph.

88
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.630
Each one has a class of title.

89
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.120
Then we have an image and we have a UL.

90
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.990
And inside the U.S., we have to realize, right, and we have a script.

91
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.880
OK, so this is our JavaScript script, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a style here as

92
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.470
well, a style tag or a style element, and I'm going to save it.

93
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.820
So this is what we have so far.

94
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.000
So I'm going to zoom in out of it and I'm going to come down and to the console.

95
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.620
Just come down and I'm going to let's make this window a bit bigger and the Vas code a bit smaller.

96
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.000
So let's come here.

97
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.030
All right.

98
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.780
So this is what we have so far and we are going to work with this.

99
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.170
All right.

100
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.630
And in this style, we are going to grab the image.

101
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.570
We are going to give it a height within the object fit cover.

102
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.590
All right.

103
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.860
So first off, the way that we can connect JavaScript to the JavaScript object to the document is we

104
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.380
have to be able to select it.

105
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.810
OK, then when we selected, we are going to we are going to manipulate it.

106
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.080
We are going to change it.

107
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.770
Right.

108
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.430
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to select the heading.

109
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.590
So I'm going to store it inside a variable and the variable name is heading it s.

110
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.880
So so where is this heading located it is located inside the document.

111
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.520
All right, so we just saw that all this time.

112
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.180
They're located inside the document, which is an object of JavaScript.

113
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.890
And from there, we are going to we are going to use a method which is called get aliments by CLASSILY.

114
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.620
And this method is pretty descriptive.

115
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.110
Get elements by Klausener mean.

116
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.790
It means get elements of a class.

117
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.610
And in here we should pass in a class.

118
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.200
Now, this class has to be a like a valid Cyesis class selector.

119
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.990
All right.

120
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:37.650
So when we want to select a class in Cyesis, we pass in a dot and then we select that title.

121
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.680
But in here, because we have said it is a class name, we don't have to pass in the done, but the

122
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.910
concept is the same.

123
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.920
We just selected by the class name.

124
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.800
So now this H1 has been selected.

125
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:58.680
The way we can see it, the way we can know for sure that this has been selected is just to simply consider

126
00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.290
the logic.

127
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.720
So we are going to say consider dialogue heading, and when I say that we are going to get an e-mail

128
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.170
collection, which is each one.

129
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.190
Let me bring this up.

130
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.210
Come on, buddy.

131
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:18.740
So in here, it says that it is a rich one that has a class of title, and when I hover over it, the

132
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.850
dogs, it's going to be highlighted.

133
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.770
See, so now we have successfully grabbed our each one.

134
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:35.570
All right, so this is how we can select e-mail elements by their classmate, and next up, I want to

135
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.150
show you how you can select e-mail elements by their names or by their ID.

136
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:48.200
And the reason that I'm not really stressing on these two methods and I'm just giving you one example,

137
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:56.330
is that we are not going to be using these methods in our projects because the newer features of JavaScript,

138
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:06.110
they have they have given us a better way of selecting HTML elements, and that is through query selector

139
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.690
and that is the recommended method.

140
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.110
All right, but these methods, you should all you should know that these methods also exist.

141
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.170
So let's go ahead and let's check out.

142
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.970
I'm just going to go ahead and comment that out.

143
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:26.090
Check out which one which one does have an I.D. So this image has an I.D. and the idea is dog dash emoji.

144
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:33.600
So the way we can select it is we have to store it inside a variable so we can we can define a variable

145
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.990
using let or const.

146
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.910
If it is const, we should not reassign it later.

147
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:46.380
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, so this is an image, I'm just going to call it image

148
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:52.760
or I'm just going to say dog I M.G., OK, and we are going to go into a word document.

149
00:09:52.770 --> 00:10:01.080
Now, the document is the part that is the demo document and we are going to say get aliment by Idy.

150
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.650
And in here we are going to pass on the idea and we we are going to save.

151
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.980
So how do we know that we have successfully accessed the idea of that image?

152
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.360
We just pass in the image in here, the image variable.

153
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:21.990
And now if I just go ahead and bring it down, you guys can see this is the image element that we have.

154
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:29.850
And when I hover over this image is highlighted, this is how we can select the stimulus elements using

155
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.130
their ID.

156
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.550
There is another selector that is the query selector all.

157
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:44.340
And I'm just going to go ahead and copy it and I'm going to pasted right here now.

158
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.470
Query selector all and query selector.

159
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.350
These are the recommended methods.

160
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.960
It selects all the elements that share that selector.

161
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.900
So whatever that selector may be, if the selector is a class selector and ID selector, an element

162
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.690
selector, whatever that is, when they share it, the query selector is going to grab all of it.

163
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:14.310
All right, so if we come here, we can see that we have three allies in here and these are the dark

164
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.040
traits, right?

165
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:16.750
I think.

166
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.150
Doc, yeah, the it doesn't have a class.

167
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:26.640
We are going to call them Doc Treats, OK, and all three of them have the same class.

168
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.770
So how would we select that?

169
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.130
If we use the single query selector without the all keyword, it is going to select the first one.

170
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.160
But when we do the query selector all it is going to select all of them.

171
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:46.410
So we are going to say let dog traits be equal to first.

172
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:53.760
Let's grab this document and from there we are going to say query selector or so.

173
00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:00.540
Whenever you do query selector, you don't you're not limited to using classes or IDs.

174
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.630
You can use any valid xerces selector.

175
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.170
So in here you can do Sudoku versus pseudo aliments.

176
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:13.170
You can even do the universal selector, you can do classes, IDE's element selector.

177
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:19.060
You can do whatever you want as long as that selector is a valid Cyesis selector.

178
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.990
So now we are going to grab it by the class.

179
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:29.970
And this class is very familiar too, because this is how we select Estima elements using CSF and this

180
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:35.640
is the part where JavaScript is linked, is connected to this as well through the dumb.

181
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:43.460
So through the document, JavaScript is linked to e-mail and through these classes, JavaScript is linked

182
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.680
to Cyesis and also we can apply Cyesis styles inside our JavaScript document.

183
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.200
We are going to take a look at that as well.

184
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.590
So now let's go ahead and let's cancel the log, this dog trait's and let's save it.

185
00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.930
And now we are going to get a Nobilis.

186
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.780
And inside here we are going to have three items.

187
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:08.010
And when I hover over them, we are going to see the first item highlighted, the second and the third.

188
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.420
So this is how query selector all works.

189
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.360
And finally, we are going to talk about overclass.

190
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.600
There are a lot more selections, but these but this query selector is the king of them.

191
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:27.800
All this to query selector all its it has definitely its applications, but it's not that common.

192
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.850
But Query Selector is the one which we are going to use a lot.

193
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:39.550
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this image based on its ID.

194
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:45.170
All right, so I'm going to do let dog I M.G. be equal to first.

195
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.260
Let's grab let's go inside this time of document.

196
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.160
And from there we are going to do query selector and that's it.

197
00:13:52.670 --> 00:14:00.890
So inside the quotations here, we should do a valid e-mail, evaluate, see as a selector of Estima

198
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:07.940
elements so I can select it based on the ID, based on the source, based on the out, based on the

199
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.870
elements selector.

200
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:14.510
I can selected any way that I want, but I want to selected using the I.D. so I'm going to grab the

201
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.640
I.D. name and I'm going to paste it here now with this work.

202
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:24.770
No, it is not going to work because we talked about how inside the quotation, inside the quotes,

203
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:31.820
it is the realm of Cyesis selector and in Cyesis how do we select it is we put a hash in front of it

204
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.260
and when we save it and when we cancel the log it.

205
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:46.400
Dog, HMG, when we say that we have successfully selected our image, that's it for this year.

206
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.280
See you guys in the next one.
