00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,119
Hi, everyone, in this last year, we are going to refactor our code to make it look cleaner.

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:15,780
All right, so here we have an if statement nested inside, another if statement.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,160
All right.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all this if statement and I'm going to cut it and I'm going

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,530
to put it inside its own function.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,530
And the function name is going to be check for match.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,700
Right.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,030
And we are going to put in this statement right here.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,170
Right.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,930
And we are going to call this function here.

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,820
Check for match.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,900
OK, let's put in the parentheses.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,980
So this looks way better than before.

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,380
Right.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,890
This is more readable because this function is not cluttered a lot and we can read it.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,470
We know what how everything works.

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,660
But there is still some refactoring that we need to do here.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:07,370
And the the way that I'm going to do is now this disabled cards and then flip cards, these names,

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,980
I've added them intentionally because each of them is going to be the name of a function inside which

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,930
we are going to run these two lines of code.

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,530
So first off, I'm going to create a function.

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,420
I'm going to call a disable cards.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,590
Right.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:27,170
And in here, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and cut this and I'm going to put it

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,990
right here and I'm going to delete this comment.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,760
And I'm going to I'm going to excuse me.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,580
I'm going to call that function right here.

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,000
Right.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,690
And the same thing goes for our

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,860
handful of cards.

31
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,550
Right.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:53,090
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to create a function and I want to call it unflavored cards.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,140
Right.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,960
And inside here, I'm going to grab this, which ends right here.

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,690
And I'm going to pasted right here and I'm going to save it.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,920
Right.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,720
And I'm going to delete this.

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,940
And we are going to call the function here.

39
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,009
Right.

40
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,850
So we have a check for match function, which is called right here.

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,170
And inside this function, we have callback function.

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,760
So we have other functions.

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,760
When a function is inserted as an argument or as a return value for another function, it is a callback

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,190
function.

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,210
So these are callback functions.

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,790
All right.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,980
Now, this disable cards does this and this flip cards does this.

48
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,920
Now, there is something that I forgot to mention that whenever we grab the first card and the second

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,710
card and when we remove the flip, we have to add the flip class first and then we can remove it.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,110
All right.

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,030
Now, here we had a toggle this the class listed are Tuggle.

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,090
Now, toggle was just for demonstration purposes, but whenever we want to remove first, we need to

53
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,460
add it.

54
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,120
That's why I commented out the toggle.

55
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,210
I'm not going to remove it.

56
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,100
I commented out the toggle and we added the flip class.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,620
And then when we are done, when they do not match, this is the answer.

58
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,080
Of course we are going to see the cards for for one point five seconds and then the class is going to

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,790
be removed.

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,520
Right.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,650
Now, this is just going to remove this comment because the function name is pretty comprehensive,

62
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,830
check for much disable cars and flip cards.

63
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,240
Right.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,950
And what I'm going to do here is that we have an if statement.

65
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,360
We have talked about the term operator and each of these F statements.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,800
They basically run a single block of code.

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,260
They run a function call.

68
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:54,730
What we can do is we can't even we can take this if statement one step further and we can simplify it

69
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,660
even further.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,180
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to call it as matched.

71
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,890
And we are going to set it to this value.

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm going to put it right here, right.

73
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,050
And we are going to use our Turner operator.

74
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,800
So if is matched is true.

75
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,850
If it is true.

76
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,290
So if you just provide it with is much, this is going to be a boolean statement.

77
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,530
The the value returned from this is matched is either going to be true or false.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,380
If the first car matches the second card in both type and value.

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,900
Notice the strict equality operator.

80
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,230
If they match in both in TypePad value, then this is matched is going to be true.

81
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,190
And if this is matched is true, what do we want?

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,730
We want to run the disable cards function and if it is not true, we want to run the unfoiled cards

83
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,280
function.

84
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,140
Now what we can do is we can go ahead and remove that.

85
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,830
That's it.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,050
So this is how we do refactoring in JavaScript.

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,530
We could do a lot more.

88
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,170
And we when we get to our further lectures, we might even implement more refactoring.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,560
All right.

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,730
So we have not talked about refactoring before.

91
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,020
This is the first lecture that we talk about that.

92
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,630
So from now on, when we talk about cleaning up the code, we actually mean refactoring.

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,310
All right.

94
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:28,230
So when the is matched is true, it means that the first card equals the second card.

95
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,700
We are going to run the disabled cards.

96
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,640
It means that when the first card matches the second card, we want to disable the cards.

97
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,170
We do not want to flip them again.

98
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:46,120
But if the first card does not match the second card after one point five seconds, we want to flip

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,330
them.

100
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,540
OK, and the logic works, right?

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,680
So I guess this is going to be it for this next year.

102
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,470
See you guys in the next one.
