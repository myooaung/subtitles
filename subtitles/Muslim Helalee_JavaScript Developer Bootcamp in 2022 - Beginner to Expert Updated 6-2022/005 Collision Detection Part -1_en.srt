1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,470
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to detect the edges of the canvas.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,800
All right, so what are we going to do first is I'm just going to get rid of this line of code right

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,340
here and now before diving into the detection, we need to specify the other directions that the ball

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,490
is going to move as well.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,230
So we are going to say F now, in case you're wondering why we are not using the F alse, because each

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,400
of these F statements, they have to work separately from the other.

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:41,200
So if you use if else own like you use F statement and then you are going to have three else clauses.

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,300
Right.

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:50,130
And then that in that case we can only travel in one direction and the ball is not going to travel diagonally.

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,280
And why is that?

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,150
Because only one of the conditions can can can become true.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,420
But in this case, two conditions can can be true.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,300
But in the case of F ls, only one condition can be true.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,120
No.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,989
Two conditions.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:14,050
So if you have F and F else, in no circumstance the F and if else can be true together, that's what

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,890
we are looking for.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
We want two conditions to be true together.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,600
For example, if you want to move the ball to the bottom direction and to the left direction.

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,760
So the bottom end, left, right.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,930
I'm going to show it to here.

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,900
So this is going to be bottom and this is going to be left.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,880
If you do bottom left, you're going to get a diagonal movement of the ball.

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,600
So you can see that I'm going to show you to see.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,950
So if I want to move it to top and to right, I'm going to get a diagonal move.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,950
So top right.

27
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,380
See, bottom left, top left, bottom right.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,730
So now you can get a diagonal movement as well.

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,000
You have to keep that in mind.

30
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,610
If you change on these if statements, then only one condition can be true.

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,140
But we don't want to do that.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,450
The same goes goes to this our own parts.

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,100
The same goes to these ones.

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,300
It's basically the same ideology.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:17,110
So for the second one, I'm going to say if the down direction is true, grab the position of Y for

36
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,420
that for that ball and then do what?

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,110
Because in the down direction it's positive.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,830
We are just going to add the speed to that coordinate of the ball so the ball is going to move down.

39
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,900
Let's save it, check it out here.

40
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,050
So now the ball is moving down, the ball is moving up.

41
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,510
We are not detecting the edges.

42
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,540
We are going to do that in this lecture as well.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,210
And now let's do the same thing for the extraction.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:55,300
So if the left direction is true, do what grabbed the extraction and from the extraction, subtract

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,460
the speed, because when we are moving to the left, we are actually moving in the negative direction

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,960
of X, right.

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,570
That's why we are going to subtracted from the speed.

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:12,300
And finally, what we have for the right is for the right dir to be true.

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,660
Grab the X position and from the X position.

50
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,030
Just add speed to it.

51
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,190
So now let's save it.

52
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,320
Check it out, huh?

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
Going up, going down.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,670
Going left, going right.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
So going diagonally.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,850
Going diagonally.

57
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,140
And there we go.

58
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,180
So now this is done.

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,110
The only thing remaining for us to do is to detect the edges.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,090
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to write collision detection.

61
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,820
How can we detect the edge?

62
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,860
Well, basically, the way that we can detect the age for the most part, is going to be just using

63
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,760
gift statements.

64
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,690
So first off, I'm just going to create a function and I'm going to call it collision detection.

65
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:06,680
With a small CD section, you can call it boundary detection as well, doesn't matter as long as you

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,490
get the idea.

67
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,870
So first off, let's do collision detection for the.

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,430
I'm going to do for the top direction because that's top boundary.

69
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,990
That's the convention that we have done so far.

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:29,210
So I'm going to say f the Y position of the ball is less than the radius.

71
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,970
You know what, I'm going to do it for the bottom first so that in that case it makes much more sense.

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,380
I can explain it better that way.

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:48,630
So bottom boundary and I'm going to say f the Y position of the ball y position of the ball is greater

74
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,350
than canvas element height.

75
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,160
All right, do what?

76
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,050
So let's see guns on that log.

77
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,150
Uh.

78
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,740
Collision.

79
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,120
Collision.

80
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,160
Detec.

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Come on, I'm just going to say detected collision is very difficult to spell.

82
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,000
So now what does that mean?

83
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,010
What does that canvas element Dutkiewicz mean?

84
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,820
So this is our canvas, right?

85
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,200
This this blue box and this top part of the canvas.

86
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,080
What is the height for the top part of the canvas?

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,200
The height for the top part of the canvas is zero because that's where the canvas originates from.

88
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,460
So the original point of the canvas is always going to be this top left corner for the why it's going

89
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,840
to be this point.

90
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,120
So this point is actually zero.

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,510
Why?

92
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,070
And what is it for the X?

93
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,930
For the X?

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,010
This is going to be the zero X as well.

95
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,050
So if I move from this line, which is the top part of the height of the canvas, which is in this in

96
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,290
this entire line, the Y is always going to be zero.

97
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,200
Keep in mind, we are not talking about the X, we're just talking about the Y.

98
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,860
So in this case, we can see that we have not moved even by one pixel in the Y direction.

99
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,990
So the Y is zero.

100
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,600
And now keep in mind that now let's say that we travel all the way to here.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,230
So this is where the canvas ends now.

102
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,140
Here is where the canvas is height s.

103
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:38,740
So we have said that the canvas height is 600, so zero pixels all the way to 600 pixels at the point

104
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,200
of 600 pixel.

105
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,250
We have the canvas height.

106
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,570
If the Y position of the ball, which is the center of the ball, keep in mind the Y position of the

107
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,410
ball and the X position of the ball is going to be the center of that ball if the center of the ball

108
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,060
passes this.

109
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,220
So it's going to be something like this.

110
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,360
You can see that we are going to fire that event.

111
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,500
OK, it didn't fire.

112
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,240
Right?

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,270
Let's come here.

114
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,010
So what's happening here?

115
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,840
So we said, oh, we did not call this collision detection.

116
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,270
So what I'm going to do as I'm going to call the collision detection, that's why the function is not

117
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,080
doing anything.

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,200
Now, if the center of this ball.

119
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,450
Passes, come on, man.

120
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,410
All right, so if the center of this ball passes, the canvas is height, we should bring something

121
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,180
to the console.

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
So let's bring this down.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,980
There we go, you can see that the collision is being continuously detected and you can see that the

124
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,480
collision is not detected because the center of the ball is not passing the height.

125
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,310
So this is when the collision is being detected.

126
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:02,690
But the cool thing is that and the weird part is that we do not want to determine the collision right

127
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,140
at the center of the ball.

128
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,760
We want to determine the collision at the circumference of the ball, not the center of the ball.

129
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,020
This is where things get interesting, not weird.

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,180
I take back what I said.

131
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,350
Interesting.

132
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,730
All right.

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:25,490
So when the position of the ball, the Y position is greater than the canvas is height y position is

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,850
for 300 when it is like 600 and one, we are going to fire this event.

135
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,549
So if I clear it and if I come down here, you can see that this event is continuously being fired.

136
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,380
I'm going to zoom in so you can really see it like that.

137
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,760
See, this has been fired continuously.

138
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:52,460
So in order to detect the center of the ball collision with this canvas height, what we can just do

139
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,380
is whenever the ball is right here, just go ahead and stop the ball to here.

140
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,270
Do not go down.

141
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,120
But this is not called this is not collision detection.

142
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,310
All right, so what is collision detection?

143
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,180
Collision detection is whenever the ball hits the ball, circumference hits this bottom of the canvas.

144
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,600
That's what so we need to add on.

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,070
We need to add on this radius.

146
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,720
The distance, which is from the center of the circle to any side of the circle, is going to be the

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,320
radius.

148
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,890
And you can see that if this is our circle, we have four sets.

149
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,790
So we have top.

150
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,880
We have left, we have right and we have bottom.

151
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,810
So the top part is going to be determined whenever we want to collide with the top part of the canvas,

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,040
the left part of the circle is going to be determined.

153
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,150
The radius, whenever we want to collide with the left part of the canvas and so on.

154
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,180
Bottom, bottom and right and right, right.

155
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,380
So now we need to pass in the radius somehow, somewhere.

156
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,090
So if I say that the Y p and if I go ahead and if I add it here, let's see what's going to happen.

157
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,200
So the radius plus that and we should see it.

158
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,020
So now if I come here.

159
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,050
Right at the edge, right at where we get the edge, you can see that this event is being fair.

160
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,270
So it means, you know, I can't, like, actually get it to go there.

161
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,790
So I'm just going to decrease the speed to, for example, one pixel at a time.

162
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,720
So now this this is going to be better.

163
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,740
So whenever it touches this, that edge, the event is being fired.

164
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,470
See, so now this is called collision detection.

165
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,270
So there is another way of doing it as well, and that is if I just remove the radius from here.

166
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,190
OK.

167
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:54,480
And say, canvasses, height minus radius, this is going to detect that for us as well.

168
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,240
So let's come down here.

169
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,430
And there we go.

170
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:07,820
So it's actually up to you which way you want to do it, if this way makes more sense that the white

171
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,400
position plus the radius, so radius is going to be 50.

172
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,240
So we are going to have six of 350.

173
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,100
Right.

174
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:26,720
And whenever we pass the 600 mark by by an amount greater than 600, which is going to be traversed

175
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,590
by this, the position of the ball, then the edge of the canvas is going to be detected.

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,310
Right.

177
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,290
And so whichever way is cooler for you, you can suffice to that.

178
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,000
You can do that.

179
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:48,290
And it's actually OK, because in both cases we are we are going to detect the edge of the screen.

180
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,680
Right.

181
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,280
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to leave it right here, or I think

182
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,990
it is going to make most sense if I just leave it here and we say, why plus radius.

183
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,650
So now, instead of doing this, what I want to do is I want to grab the Y position and I'm going to

184
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,780
say canvas element, height minus radius.

185
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,320
So let's save it.

186
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,130
Let's come here.

187
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,020
Let's see what we get.

188
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,580
So if I come down here.

189
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,570
There we go, so we can no longer go down, right?

190
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,070
So if we were to now what what it is that we have done here, so we have changed the wipers whenever

191
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,060
the position of the ball plus the radius is greater than the height.

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,010
What do we want?

193
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,160
Do we want to reposition that ball?

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,900
So the.

195
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,380
And in which direction?

196
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,460
In the wide ruction.

197
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,020
So in the right direction.

198
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,150
This Y position.

199
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,960
Where is it?

200
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,400
It's it's 300.

201
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,700
Right.

202
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,140
Initially it's 300.

203
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,460
But when it does touch, it has touched the bottom of the canvas.

204
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:02,560
We want to change their value to the canvas height, which is 600 minus the radius, which is 50.

205
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:10,340
All right, so you can do this as well, and for this to make a better sense, I'm just going to put

206
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:17,840
the radius right here so you can see that if it is greater than the canvas height, just just make this

207
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,820
can white position equal to that canvas height minus radius.

208
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:31,250
And I'm just going to specify a plus an equality sign here in case it is equal to or greater than that.

209
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,160
Then we want to fire that event.

210
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,210
Now, if we do not provided the equality sign.

211
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,640
I hope I can show it to you.

212
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:45,250
And we should see detected what you might ask.

213
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,170
What is the difference.

214
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,900
So if I come down here.

215
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,010
Oh, boy.

216
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,200
There we go.

217
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:59,850
You can see that it says detected, but if you look closely here, it seems as though I you know, it

218
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:07,320
seems that the ball is is moving out of the screen by at least one pixel because the ball has to move

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,740
off the canvas for this to be detected.

220
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,500
So we don't want to do that.

221
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,880
We want to say if it is equal or greater than that whenever the ball touches it or goes off of it,

222
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,440
we just want to position that.

223
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,490
So let's save this now.

224
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,210
Let's put it to back to ten.

225
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,860
It was.

226
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:36,570
So right here now you can see that we are not moving off the screen, even by one pixel, and this event

227
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,440
is being fired.

228
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:45,610
OK, so we have done collision detection for one one part of our.

229
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,580
Our canvas, so collision detection for the left, for the right and for the top are still remaining.

230
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:02,340
I planned on completing this collision detection in one lecture, but it seems like I have to spin it

231
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,270
over to lectures.

232
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,470
So in the next lecture, the ideology is going to be similar, but the direction is going to be different.

233
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,270
So what we are going to do is in the next lecture we're going to apply this collision detection principles

234
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,260
for the left, right and up part of our canvas.

235
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,350
That's it for this lecture.

236
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,010
See you guys in the next one.
