00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,569
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:08,670
In this letter, we are going to talk about the appends, the prepend, the removed child and the Remove

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,990
Dume Method's.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:21,160
All right, so we have been able to successfully append two children to and you add that in our previous

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,670
lecture, but in this lecture, the Mark-Up is a bit different.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,090
And I want to append I want to use this old order list as well.

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:36,040
So what if you want to add or you want to add more than one element to a Web page?

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,780
So we have we have talked about about two ways of adding only one element to a Web page.

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,920
So what if you want to add more than one element, that's where the append method comes in.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,050
So what I'm going to do is, first off, it has the same drill.

11
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,570
The first step is creating the element.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,770
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and say first is going to be this is step number

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,140
one, creating the element.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:01,840
So.

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,940
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new H5 element, a new H5 element, and I'm going to say

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,740
document dot, create element, very simple.

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,790
And in here, I'm going to pass five and I'm going to create an inch six aliment as well, so I'm going

18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,270
to grab this and that, I'm going to turn into six.

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,880
So now we have successfully created two new elements.

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,820
We can kick him out in the console as well.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,470
So we can say new age five, we are going to see our age five and we can also say New Age sex.

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:49,520
It's 6:00 and we are going to see an on at 6:00 a.m. aliment, so this is the step number one.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,300
The step number two is giving our elements an identity.

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:01,610
Well, it doesn't matter if which steps comes before which, but this this procedure makes the most

25
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,930
it makes the most sense, the most news.

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,940
All right.

27
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,020
So we are going to grab our new, not their new at 5:00.

28
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,330
And we are going to say that N-word text equal to cats.

29
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,070
All right.

30
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,470
And we are going to grab it the next time.

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,460
And we are going to save birds for the H six.

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,120
Let's save it.

33
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,240
And now it's five and six.

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,910
Both of them.

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,890
They have some identity.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:40,860
All right, for the third step, we find an element to append these as the relatives of that element.

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,850
All right.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,580
So for that, I'm going to go ahead.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,760
I'm going to say CONSED and I'm going to grab a main heading.

40
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:57,420
It is DeMain heading and I'm going to say document that query selector, select the one, save it.

41
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:06,930
And now the final the final thing that we have to do here is Main Dot hadn't many men heading dot append.

42
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,420
Not a child died of pain.

43
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,000
What do we want to spend?

44
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,750
We want to open the new H5 and New Age six and let's save it.

45
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,820
And if we come here, we are going to see that we are going to see cats and we are going to see birds.

46
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,320
Now, let's let's increase this window.

47
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,040
Let's go into our aliments and let's come here.

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,620
So where are our acharn?

49
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,780
Which we can't see them.

50
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,710
Oh, they're here.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,440
So they have been nested inside this one.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,600
I mean, this might not be something that you want, but this is actually how a pen works.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
We can nest elements.

54
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,810
All right.

55
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,870
And this is not something that you ever do.

56
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,110
So I should have probably should have come up with a better example.

57
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,940
But this conveys the point.

58
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,590
This is not something that you do.

59
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,150
You never nest titles.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,920
That's I've never faced it in my entire development journey.

61
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,180
Work development.

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,230
All right.

63
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,940
So this is one way of doing it.

64
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,650
And this is one way of creating you could have created two allies and you could have just appended it

65
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,760
to a user and you know how you can do that, like as a challenge.

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,779
Go ahead and do that.

67
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,829
All right.

68
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,700
So method number eight.

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,180
Now, take a look at this.

70
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:30,080
Whenever you do append or you do a pin child, they're always going to be added to the end of that element.

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,800
What if you want to add it to the start of the element?

72
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,850
That's where our method number eight comes from.

73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,940
It is called prepend.

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,440
Prepend, OK, and we are simply going to say mean heading.

75
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:58,040
Dot prepend, prepend, prepend, what new age five, very, very simple stuff, new age six, it's

76
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,490
seven.

77
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,790
And now cats and birds, they're on top of the ducks.

78
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:02,920
All right.

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,690
And now this has been prepend it.

80
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,190
That was the appendix.

81
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,420
This is the prepend.

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,320
This is method number eight.

83
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,660
Let's go ahead and let's talk about our final two methods, which are method number nine and method

84
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,290
number ten.

85
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,260
Now, we have not really talked about how we can remove elements through JavaScript, so we are going

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,360
to go ahead and we are going to say we are going to just pasted here and turn it tonight and we are

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
going to say remove a child.

88
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,120
So there are two ways of removing an element from a Web page.

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,540
The first way is remove a child.

90
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,590
Now, this method I'm just going to in parentheses will not in parentheses, I'm just going to do it

91
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,440
requires a parent note.

92
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,110
So if you want to remove any element through this method, you have to provide it with a parent kind

93
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,830
of reference.

94
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,960
All right, so what we are going to do is let's go ahead, let's check out our.

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
Our markup.

96
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,270
OK, so in here, what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to I'm going to select this.

97
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,720
Oh well.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,000
And I'm going to remove an element from this.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,630
Oh, well, that's why this oil has been added here.

100
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,660
So let's go ahead and let's select the oil.

101
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,340
I'm going to say consed to do list.

102
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:38,220
Right to do list document that query selector and we're going to selected by the element name which

103
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,820
is OEL.

104
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,880
We are going to select the item that we want to remove as well.

105
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:55,080
So we are going to say consed to do item document dot query selector and we are going to say oh well

106
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,420
elai and dash child, let's say child number three.

107
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,070
That's added.

108
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,740
The search for number three, let's save it so now, because we want to delete this, this this repeat

109
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:21,560
coffee item or a child from this webpage, what we have to do is first we have to select the parent

110
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,480
and then we can select the airline.

111
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,550
So this is what we remove child does and requires a parent.

112
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,910
That's why we have selected the parent as well.

113
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,020
And you might ask, why do why why have you selected the child itself?

114
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,640
Because we want to remove it.

115
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:43,330
We want to have we want to give JavaScript a way to select it and then remove it.

116
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,760
It's exactly like in see, assess you select an element and you say display none and that's it.

117
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,380
Or you say visibility hidden or you say opacity zero.

118
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,950
First you got a selected right to do some sort of thing on it.

119
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:07,840
OK, so we are going to say to do list, dot, remove, remove, child, what is the child that we want

120
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,370
to remove?

121
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,380
We want to remove the to do to the worries over item to do item.

122
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:21,360
And when I say yes, and here you can see that we don't have any third option in here anymore.

123
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,690
So the third item has been removed.

124
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,680
So this is one way of removing.

125
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,640
Elements from a Web page, the next one is even better.

126
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:37,309
All right, so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to copy it from here to here.

127
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,210
Well, actually, I'm going to grab it, all of it, and I'm going to paste it here.

128
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,990
This is our final method, method number 10.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,770
And it is just remove it and remove this one does not require a parent.

130
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,780
We can just select the item and we can just remove it.

131
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,900
So for that, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and comment this one out because and

132
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,250
common the parent out.

133
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,790
We have successfully selected the item number three that we want to remove and we are going to say to

134
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,580
do item dot remove.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,490
And because this is a method we are going to add parentheses and save it and it is removed.

136
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,510
So taking a look at it, this is a way better approach than remove a child.

137
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,390
But sometimes you you you might want to do this.

138
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,610
You might want to be really, really specific.

139
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,410
All right.

140
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:41,790
And also, this is a newer syntax, so it may not it might not have that sort of like really outstanding

141
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,950
browser compatibility.

142
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,690
So do check before using it.

143
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,240
Right.

144
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,210
So this brings about the end of this lecture.

145
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,060
See you guys in the next one.
