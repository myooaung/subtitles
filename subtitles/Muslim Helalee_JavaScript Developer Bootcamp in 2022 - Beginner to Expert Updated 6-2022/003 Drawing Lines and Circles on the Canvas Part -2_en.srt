00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:08,200
Hi, everyone, welcome to the second part of drawing lines and circles on the canvas.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:17,370
All right, so we have specified some initial values, right, for the size, for whether or not the

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,910
click is pressed or the mouse is down, for the color and also for X and Y coordinates.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,070
Now, there are actually three steps to using canvas through JavaScript.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:39,090
The first step we have implemented is to find or to address the canvas element inside our JavaScript,

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,570
which we have done here.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,720
The second step is creating a drawing object, which is this one get context study and the third step

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,730
is actually drawing on the canvas.

9
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,660
Now, to be able to draw a line, we need two methods.

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,830
The first method is move to and the second method is aligned.

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:08,100
Now the move to method defines the starting point of the line and the line to method defines the ending

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,880
point of a line.

13
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,870
Right.

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,350
And first off, we are going to go ahead and implement the line and then we will be talking about the

15
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,500
drawing a circle.

16
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,680
All right.

17
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,540
So what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to grab our canvas and I'm going to add a listener.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
Now, the event that I'm listening for is going to be Moorestown.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,500
And I'm going to I'm going to tell you why.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,190
Moorestown.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,570
Right.

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,370
And when the mouse is down, what I want is I want to run a function.

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,390
Right.

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,080
And I want to grab the event object as well, because we will be needing that.

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:53,580
So when the mouse is pressed down, it means that we want to start drawing on the canvas and in that

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,510
case it means that the is is equal to true.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,460
So we are going to grab or is pressed and we are going to set it to true.

28
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,370
Right.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,180
Very simple.

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,060
Initially the is pressed is fast because the user has not clicked.

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,740
Has the mouse is not down.

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,430
All right.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,290
But when the when the event is fired, the march down event or the click event is fired.

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,150
Why do we want we want to say that the express it is true now.

35
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,730
We want to specify exactly where it is that the user has clicked.

36
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,920
So we are going to grab our X coordinates, which we have specified before, and we have set an undefined

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,920
value because we don't know what the values and we are going to grab our event object and we are going

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
to say off set X.

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,590
All right, so the X is going to be the offset of X and the Y is going to be the offset of Y, you guessed

40
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,310
it right.

41
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,380
All right, just grab this wire and capitalize it.

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,610
We can go ahead and check check these out in the council as well, where exactly they are.

43
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,330
So we are going to say.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,540
Let's let's just consider log X for now.

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,880
So we are going to come here.

46
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,990
This is a project.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
Let's inspect it.

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,980
And when I click there, it is going to give me the what?

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
The X coordinates.

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,500
All right.

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,970
So in here, the offsets should be almost zero.

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,300
This is towards zero.

53
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,120
And in here it should be towards 1500.

54
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,690
The reason that it is near 1500 is that we have specified the width of our can.

55
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,800
Where is it in here?

56
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,100
The width of the canvas is 1500.

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,600
So the starting point for the X on the canvas is zero is right there zero.

58
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,650
And the ending point should be 1500.

59
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,130
See if we can get it.

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,940
There we go, 1500, but what about why so for the why the starting point is again zero and the ending

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,180
point is 600, we can't conceive that we can log it to the council as well.

62
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,410
But I'm not going to do because.

63
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,640
Very, very simple.

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,240
All right, so we have done this now, the other event listener that I want to add on the canvas is

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,440
actually the polar opposite of this.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,480
So I'm going to say canvas that Adamsville listener.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,510
And we are going to listen for a mouse up.

68
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,600
For a mouse up event, right, and we are going to run a function.

69
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,950
Oops, not there.

70
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,420
We are going to run a function when the mouse is up.

71
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,650
Function, they're going to grab the event object as well, right?

72
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:55,000
So when the mouse is not clicked or the mouse is up, we want to say that the press is going to be equal

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,660
to false.

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:03,310
It means that the user is not pressing because we have just received a mouse up event.

75
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,150
A mouse up event has been fired.

76
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,360
When the mouse up event is fired, it means that the user is not clicking.

77
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,850
When the user is not clicking, we just want to set the express defaults once more.

78
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:25,030
And the X coordinate is going to be undefined and the Y coordinate is going to be undefined as well

79
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,610
because the user is not clicking, we do not know where the user is clicking because the user is actually

80
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,320
not clicking.

81
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,900
So the values, they're not defined anymore.

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:43,630
All right, so now we will move on to drawing the line, I think we talked about how we will be first

83
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,570
drawing a line.

84
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,010
All right.

85
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,910
So let's go ahead and let's create that function right here.

86
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,870
So I'm just going to call it drawing line.

87
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,130
Drawing lines, just color drawing lines.

88
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:06,380
And I want to create a function and I'm going to call it draw lines or just simple, like singular,

89
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:15,650
and we are going to grab our we are going to pass in four parameters, which we will be using, of course.

90
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:27,870
All right, so and we have talked about how we need a method force for the start of that line and a

91
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,000
method for the end of that line.

92
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,410
All right.

93
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,570
So for the ending of it, so the starting points, I'm just going to call him X1 and why one and the

94
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,350
ending points?

95
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,780
I'm going to call him X2 and why.

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,480
All right.

97
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,840
So we are going to grab our object and we are going to say.

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,340
Begin path, so begin path.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,860
Where is the Intellisense there, so now this begin path method is actually going to start, if you

100
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,750
like, that path that we want to create, the next method that I want to call on this city acts as the

101
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:17,020
move to that we have talked about move to and this method is going to grab these starting points for

102
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,710
a line.

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,610
So the starting points are X one and Y one.

104
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,400
So I'm just going to go ahead and pass them right here.

105
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,930
So it's Copperas, pass them here as function arguments.

106
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:36,160
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the seats and I'm going to say line two, this is

107
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,300
going to be the ending points for a line.

108
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,820
So let's grab the X2 and Y two.

109
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,180
Let's pass them right here.

110
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,170
So now the line is drawn.

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,600
All right, whenever the user clicks.

112
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,020
But we don't have any actual way of linking this function to these events, which we will do in our

113
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,800
next lectures.

114
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,100
But for now, what we want to do is we want to accomplish drawing the line function and drawing a circle

115
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,550
function.

116
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:11,920
The next thing that I want to do is I want to grab the seats and I want to specify the stroke style.

117
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,990
So stroke style, which is dealing with the color.

118
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,140
And I want it to be the color that we have specified here and it is going to be black.

119
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,910
So that is the stroke style is going to be black.

120
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:33,929
The width of the line for the stroke, I'm just going to call it our line with all right, it is going

121
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,179
to be size for now.

122
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm just going to leave it a size, but we are going to change it.

123
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,140
So the size is going to be 10 initially.

124
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,770
And finally, to complete this, we are going to say stroke.

125
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,790
Just we are going to call this stroke method.

126
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,060
All right.

127
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,400
So the function for the draw line is created.

128
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,690
Now, we are we are going to go ahead and create the function for draw circles.

129
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,030
Drawing circles are right.

130
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,470
It is going to be almost the same, but a bit different.

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,030
Of course, we are going to call it draw circle.

132
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:22,550
All right, and you're going to pass an X and Y in here, so we are going to say begin path.

133
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,430
So whenever we want to, we want to create a line or we want to draw a circle.

134
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,020
First off, we need to tell it to begin that we begin drawing that path.

135
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,400
All right.

136
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,840
Now, the creating the circle, we we have multiple things, right?

137
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,320
The method that we are going to call upon the.

138
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,500
The reason that we are grabbing the seats is the seat object is actually is the thing that is going

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,340
to allow us to create 2D drawings on the canvas.

140
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:54,970
Right.

141
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,000
And now looking at the clock, it's been ten minutes and I do not want to prolong this video.

142
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,080
So we are going to complete these functions in our next lecture.

143
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,310
See you guys that.
