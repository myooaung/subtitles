00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,380
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,530
In this lecture, we are going to create in a dynamic element.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,720
All right, so so far we have come to our aid to do function, so the next thing that I want to do is

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:24,120
I want to grab our knowledge of this to do done and to do line so far.

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,460
And I want to create an item dynamically.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,960
So when I just start to create it, you're going to understand exactly what I mean.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,790
What am I doing here?

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,910
Const.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,800
I hit him, all right, so I'm going to use my tactics here, and the reason that I'm using these tactics

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,740
is that we will be using our.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,500
We are going to we are going to create a dynamic element, right, and we will be using template strings

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,820
inside aerobatics.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,480
Right.

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,840
So what is going to be this dynamic element?

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,810
The dynamic element is going to be an ally inside which we are going to have three children.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,390
The class for the ally is you guessed it right.

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,440
It is going to be item which should come right here.

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,220
And then let's close the Solomon.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,020
So there I'm just going to hit tab.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,370
The first element that I'm going to create is going to be an icon.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:31,470
Now, this icon, whenever the to do is created, it is going to be a thin circle and one that to do

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,330
is collect done.

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,860
It is going to be a tegmark.

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,220
All right.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,440
So we have to toggle the class dynamically.

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,680
That's why I'm not going to call the class.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,350
So the class is going to be.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:54,820
And it's add it so it is the FAA is shared, whether it is a thin circle, whether it is a circle fan

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,510
or whether it is a circle, whatever check.

30
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:58,840
Right.

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,510
So this FAA, this first class share, the second class is going to come from this constant that we

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,550
have created there.

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,630
Right.

34
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,419
So I'm going to use our template strengths and I'm going to pass it there.

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,980
So what does it mean?

36
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,230
It means if done is true, we are going to show we are going to display the check button.

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,080
The check button is stored inside this variable.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,620
And we are going to use this variable right here inside our template strength, which allows us to access

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,650
the value for this to do done variable.

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,130
All right, and then why do we need to do as we're going to add another class of complete, which we

41
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,990
have already styled inside our success?

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,040
So this is the eye which has a class of complete.

43
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,420
These are the styles for that.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,880
So whenever that to do is done, we are going to we are going to use the class of complete.

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,120
The status is also going to be complete, which we are going to use later.

46
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,830
Right now, we go to the I.D. So what is what do you think the I.D. should be now instead of riding

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,750
the I.D., like manually zero, one, two, three.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,290
What we are going to do is we are going to create this I.D. dynamically.

49
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:13,950
Right.

50
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,170
So for that, what I'm going to do is.

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,510
I'm going to come beneath here, right, and in here, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,860
to do container.

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,870
All right, so here we create our to do container.

54
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,030
And what does this container mean?

55
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,670
It means that all of our to do is they're going to come right here inside an array that we are going

56
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,580
to create here.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,770
So let's go ahead and let's create that, let's say, to do container.

58
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,310
So this is to do container and we are going to initialize it within with a set of empty array, with

59
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,340
an empty array.

60
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,810
Right.

61
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,180
And we are going to grab our I.D. and we are going to initialize it to zero.

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,350
We are going to set it zero by default.

63
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,670
And now in here, instead of hard coding, the idea, we are just going to use it from here and then

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,990
down inside the same function, we are going to increment the ID by one.

65
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,210
Whenever we add an item, we are going to increment the ID by one.

66
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,550
So let's add the ID here.

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,540
This is our ID.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,360
And after that, so I think the first one is done.

69
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,430
So this is our I can't accept that the closing tag is still missing.

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,600
So this is our first element that we create dynamically.

71
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,090
So this is the first one.

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,030
The second one is going to be a paragraph.

73
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,280
Now, the paragraph is going to have a class of text.

74
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,750
All right, so it is going to have a class of text, which we have already styled right here, the paragraph

75
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:59,190
has a class of text, but how do we know how to add that line through that?

76
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,580
We had to this paragraph in case that to do is done.

77
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,310
So now is the time to add our second constant to do line.

78
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,260
Now you can see how these different parts play different roles.

79
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,660
So what does this mean?

80
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,900
We know what this means, but what about this one?

81
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,560
So we know whenever that done is true, we want the check button to show as well as the text line through

82
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,520
to be applied on the paragraph.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,570
So when done is through text line, through will be applied on the paragraph and the class is this line

84
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,620
through and this class has been styled right here.

85
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,540
So the style is going to be applied.

86
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:49,580
Let's close this first opening tag, and so what about the data first stuff?

87
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,480
I'm just going to close this element.

88
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,650
Now, what about the text, the content of this paragraph?

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Where does it going to come from?

90
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,780
Where is it going to come from?

91
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,550
It is going to come from from this to do parameter that we have inserted there.

92
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,010
So we are going to add a dynamically right here as well.

93
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,310
So the second element is done.

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,350
Let's move on to the third one, which is, again, another icon, which you guessed right.

95
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,010
It is our trash icon that we had, for example, one, two, three.

96
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,190
This is our trash icon that we have there.

97
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,830
Right, and we are going to add a class to it now, the class of fair is common.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,930
What about the class of trash?

99
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:39,460
So because we only have one class and we do not toggled that class to either check or uncheck, it is

100
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,560
just going to be a trash icon.

101
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,620
That's why I'm going to hardcoded here, because we do not want to toggle that dynamically because there

102
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,940
is no other class there.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,610
We only have one class and we are going to add a delete class, which we have already styled.

104
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,910
And here this is our delete class, which we have styled their.

105
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,880
All right, again, we are going to add a status.

106
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,300
The status is going to be delayed.

107
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:14,620
The status is delete and whatever ID, so we are going to do the same thing for this idea that we did

108
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,280
for this one.

109
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,290
All right, so we are going to copy the ID and we are going to put it right here.

110
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,940
And let's close this element.

111
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,160
I think we are done here and now for our very final part.

112
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,180
Let's go back one step and let's close this line as well.

113
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,330
So now we have created an ally which has a class of item inside which we have three children.

114
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,550
And this ILLI is going to be a child of this list that we have.

115
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,010
Right.

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,990
So our dynamic element has been created.

117
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,220
Now, what I'm going to do as now, whenever we create that element, we have to specify it with a position

118
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,130
where do we want to insert that element?

119
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,130
So for that, I've just opened up another page.

120
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,170
It is elements that insert adjacent HTML.

121
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,890
This is the method that we are going to be going to use, right.

122
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,290
So we are going to grab our element and we are going to call insert adjacent HTML.

123
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:25,690
It says Method of Aliment Interface parses the specified text as HDMI or XML and inserts the resulting

124
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,600
notes into the DOM tree at a specified position.

125
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,210
Well, in simple terms, what it means is we are going to grab a parent and whatever we say, insert

126
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,919
adjacent HTML.

127
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,429
It is going to add an item to that parent, right.

128
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,020
So there are four positions that we can insert that element.

129
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,740
The first position is is called before begin, which is before the element itself.

130
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,550
So if I if I added to the list, we we know that we should add it to this list.

131
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,480
If I say before I begin, it is going to come right here.

132
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:08,620
It's going to go before that list after begin, just inside the element before its first child before.

133
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,690
And this is where we are going to insert it just inside the element after its last child.

134
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,640
And why is that?

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,040
Why after it's last year, so you guys can see that this is one, two, three.

136
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,870
If I add four or five, six, four or five, six is going to come after the last child.

137
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,010
So what is the last child?

138
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,530
The last child is one, two, three and four or five.

139
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,730
Six is going to come after that because whenever we create these lists, we go from top to bottom.

140
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,500
We do not go from bottom to top.

141
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,090
We don't want to go in this order that whenever I create four or five, six, it should go on top of

142
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,390
this.

143
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,440
One, two, three.

144
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,900
No, I want it to come beneath this.

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,420
So it is called before and before the last chance.

146
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
If I click on it, this is called before entry.

147
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,150
All right.

148
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,290
And after and after the element itself, which is not something that we want to use.

149
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,600
So feel free to go ahead and check this.

150
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,580
There is a lot more stuff here.

151
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,760
Everything you need to you need to know about that.

152
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,220
I think there are some examples here as well.

153
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,420
But we are going to use our before and I'm going to copy this and I'm going to provide it inside or

154
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,500
inside of a JavaScript as a resource for you guys.

155
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,900
Now, inserting the those and the rest of the code we are going to accomplish in our next lecture.

156
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,090
See you guys then.
