00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,700
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:09,970
In this lecture, we're going to fix a small bog in the angled determination for the paddle.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,960
All right, so our application has been effectively completed, but after I played this game, I found

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,010
out that there is actually a bug in our application and you can see that whenever the A.I. hits it towards

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:33,000
the top of the paddle instead of the ball going to the top of the screen you just saw it came towards

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,160
the bottom of the screen.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,400
The case should be whenever the ice paddle hits it towards the bottom of the paddle, then it should

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,830
come down and toward the top of the paddle.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,630
It should go up.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,650
I'm just going to redo this so you can see.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,970
So now you can see it came down, but the ball has to go up.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,750
So bottom of the paddle ball moves towards the top and at an angle of 45 degrees or it is going to try

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,800
to move at that angle and bottom of the paddle.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,240
The ball should move towards the bottom of the screen at at an angle like that.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,820
Like this one.

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,120
So the our eyes paddle is OK, but the ice paddle clearly has a problem.

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,280
So what I'm going to do is this is where we have determined the direction.

18
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,550
So this is the velocity and this is the way velocity.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,800
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to grab the direction and I'm going to remove it from the Y velocity.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,520
And now let's go ahead and check it out.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,810
There we go.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,780
Now I can see that the ball moved towards the top, moved, and this one also moves towards the top.

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,870
So let me just take a look at the eye to head towards the bottom of the paddle.

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:48,350
Let's see what the is going to do there, it is going to headed towards the top as well and let's make

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,290
sure it does headed there.

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,520
There we go, and it came down so that problem is solved.

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,720
The other thing that I would like to do here is I forgot to add some Borodai here.

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,190
So for this, I'm just going to grab the radius of the ball and I'm going to add it to the direction.

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,430
And I'm just going to go ahead and clean up the code a little and I'm going to grab the the collision

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,430
point and then I'm going to then grab it out of the parentheses and then multiplied with that.

31
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,450
And let's see.

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,810
So what else do we have here in here?

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,330
I'm going to add the ball radius as well.

34
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,680
All right.

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,780
So I'm just going to say ball dot radius.

36
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,090
Let's save it.

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,450
Let's check it out here.

38
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,100
I'm just going to reload the page.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,780
I'm going to increase the volume, and I'm going to play for like a couple of minutes just to make sure

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,010
that there are no further bugs here.

41
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:45,960
All right.

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,950
So let's see.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,830
OK, so the angle for the arrows paddle is perfect and as well as the ice paddle, let's leave that

44
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,270
to the score is working perfectly fine.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,320
Perfect.

46
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,130
I'm going to try to get it to headed toward the bottom of the paddle.

47
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,100
There we go, it is coming towards the bottom and this is coming towards the bottom as well as well,

48
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,340
this is going to go top.

49
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,410
There we go.

50
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,150
So this is a more realistic kind of scenario that we have here.

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,540
And the speed is going to increase gradually.

52
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,970
There we go.

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
And I'm going to try to score like at least one against the sky.

54
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,280
And then I'm going to wrap up this video as well.

55
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:45,440
I just want to take I just want to look for any other bugs that we might end up having now before actually

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,100
doing that.

57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,650
I'm just going to go into a console and I'm going to take a look at the console as well.

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,350
We don't have any error here, so that's a good thing.

59
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,100
Now, let's go ahead and score one against this A.I., at least one.

60
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,720
All right, so I have to wait for, like a few rounds of this ball, like the ball should travel for

61
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,470
for some time until the ball speed is going to increase.

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,120
And then we will be able to basically score against this EHI.

63
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:26,960
And if you feel like this is like dumb and stupid and you want to, like, increase the intelligence

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,840
level, you can go ahead and do that, but make sure to never put it at one, because that way it is

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,360
not going to be fun at all and you're going to lose all the time.

66
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,520
So my suggestion is never increase said do not increase it.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,650
Be on point four.

68
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,560
I mean, point point four is going to be pretty advanced as well.

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,110
But still, you might have a chance of winning.

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,630
There we go, the bone speed is increasing and.

71
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,270
And we should be able to score something against this guy that was close.

72
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,720
There we go.

73
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,790
I can see it travels in a straight line when it hits it in the center and then forty five degrees.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,870
The ball speed is gradually increasing, so this is a game whenever you're playing a game, of course,

75
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,850
you want to take your time, right.

76
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,110
And you want to enjoy that.

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,990
Now, it is pretty visible that this bull is fast, faster than before.

78
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,960
I know it is taking some time, but the good thing is that whenever you play any game that you create,

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,410
you'll be able to understand, OK, what are the issues that are going to arise when you, for example,

80
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,980
you apply or deploy that game to the Internet and the users, they're actually going to go ahead and

81
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,910
play that game.

82
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,340
OK, so the ball is pretty fast now I'm trying I'm going to try to keep up with the speed of the ball,

83
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,830
not to give away any point.

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,860
There we go, there is another one, so let's wait for it until it gets to seven.

85
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:34,460
So now you can see that this is basically well, it is it cannot do anything else.

86
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,650
So that's why my suggestion is that if you increase the I'm just going to mute it.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,940
It's very irritating.

88
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,480
So my suggestion is that if you want to increase the intelligence level, go ahead and increase it to

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,800
four or maybe like 2.5 or three, then you are going to have a good time.

90
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:59,070
That's why I've used it as an independent variable, because I want you guys to have control over this

91
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,570
game.

92
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,830
So if you want to increase the intelligence level, decrease it, that is going to be based on your

93
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,550
own choice.

94
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,960
Everyone is different.

95
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,990
Some some people like to play it really, really difficult.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,010
Some people like myself like to play it lazy.

97
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,030
So that's it for this application.

98
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,620
See you guys in the next one.
