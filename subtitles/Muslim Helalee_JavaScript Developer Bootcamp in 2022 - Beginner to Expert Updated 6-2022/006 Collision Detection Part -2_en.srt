1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:09,180
Hi, everyone, in this we're going to detect the top right and left boundaries.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,930
All right, so we have detected the bottom boundary.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,130
What about the top one?

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,070
So for the top before actually going into the top boundary, I'm just going to go first for the right

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,340
because positive directions are easier than negative directions bottom and right there, positive directions.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,200
And I'm going to say right boundary and you're going to say F now we are going to say we are going to

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,920
do the same thing.

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,500
So we're going to say XP is greater or equal to what?

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,510
Instead of canvas height, we are going to do canvas with minus the radius.

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,310
What do we want to do?

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,990
We want to reposition the ball and in which direction?

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,720
We want to reposition it in the extraction.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,530
Right.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,210
Very simple.

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:08,130
So the exact position of the ball is going to change to the canvas element with so what is the canvas

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:16,640
element that with it's going to be four hundred minus the radius, so minus the radius radius is 50.

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,400
So the exposition of the circle is going to be 350, which is right up the edge.

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,450
The circumference of the circle is going to be right at the edge of the canvas.

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,980
There we go.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,470
So let's save it and let's come here, so if I go there, you can see that it touches the edge and it

21
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:43,010
can it can't move any any any further than that, because that is the point where we have specified

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,930
the exposition for the circle.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,310
So the ideology for the bottom and for the right were the same and the ideology for the top and left

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,300
are going to be the same.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:02,690
So Tom, boundry now before actually writing the code, let's go over the concept so hopefully I can

26
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,260
show it.

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,180
Why do I get that, OK?

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:14,390
Hopefully this is visible, so if I come to the top, so now I can see that accidentally the ball is

29
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,560
touching that by the.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,130
So it's a good position for me to discuss this.

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,600
What is the radius of this ball?

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,800
So the radius of this ball is the center point.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,340
Descender points distance all the way to the circumference of the ball because the circumference of

34
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,410
the ball is touching the canvas.

35
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,680
The canvas is top part.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,320
I could say that the radius of the circle is from the center point all the way to the edge of this canvas,

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,540
and it is 50 pixels.

38
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,080
All right.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,420
So it's 50 pixels.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,510
We have established that.

41
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,660
What is the Y position for the circle?

42
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,420
So we know that the Y and X position for any circle is directly in the middle of that circle.

43
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:07,070
So for the X position, we can just say we can calculate a IDOT if you just put a dot here and the distance

44
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:14,670
from this dot all the way to the edge of this canvas is going to be the X position of the this circle.

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,480
But what about the Y position?

46
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,380
That's what we are interested in.

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:27,650
The Y position of this circle is the distance that the center of the circle has traveled from the top

48
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,660
edge of the from the top of the canvas.

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,330
What is that distance?

50
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:39,170
So this topic of the canvas all the way to the middle of the circle, we just found that out.

51
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,500
It's the radius.

52
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:48,470
So in this case that the ball touches the top part of the canvas, the radius becomes equal.

53
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,990
To the Y position of the circle, I'm going to reiterate this, what is the radius of the circle?

54
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:02,460
The radius of the circle is any line that goes from the center of the circle to any part of the circle.

55
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,690
In this case, we are interested in the top part of the circle.

56
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:14,050
So if the line this line comes out from goes from the center all the way to the circumference or to

57
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,920
the edge of the circle, that is the radius.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,190
What is the radius?

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:26,810
The radius is 50 because the circle is directly touching this canvas, canvas, top edge.

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:35,170
We can say that the line from the center of the circle all the way to the top part of this box or this

61
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,220
canvas is going to be our radius.

62
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,060
What is the Y position?

63
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,290
The Y position is the distance from the canvas is, for example, top part all the way to the center.

64
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,950
Keep in mind to the center.

65
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,230
So if we have a center, a dot here, then you are going to provide it a radius and math that PI Times

66
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,360
two is going to draw that circle for.

67
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,450
So this is the Y position.

68
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,710
What is the Y position?

69
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,660
The Y position is the top part of the canvass all the way to the center of the circle.

70
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,150
We just calculated that that's equal to radius.

71
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:18,100
So the Y position of the circle, when it touches the top part of the canvas, is always going to be

72
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,490
equal to the radius.

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,400
What if it's not?

74
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,250
What if the top part of the what if the Y position of the ball is less than the radius?

75
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,590
What does that mean?

76
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,450
It means that the circle has moved off the canvas like this.

77
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:42,670
So you can see now the I'm going to just come down a little so you can see that the radius of the circle

78
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,210
is still because it goes to the edge of the circle.

79
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,940
The age of the circle is something right here.

80
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,870
It's invisible.

81
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,580
I know, but imagine it.

82
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,800
And the radius is still 50.

83
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,550
Right.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,150
But what is the Y direction y position.

85
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,510
The Y position is the line is the distance from this canvas top part to the center.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,140
And they you can see that the center distance has been reduced.

87
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,000
So the radius is no longer equal to the Y position.

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,440
The radius in fact is bigger than the Y position because the Y position was reduced by the amount of

89
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,900
the circle has moved off the canvas.

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:32,020
So whenever the circle so the circles y position is less than the radius, it means that a collision

91
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:39,700
has happened or at or to be accurate when it is equal and less than the radius, the Y position.

92
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,610
It means that a collision has has, has occurred, has occurred, has happened.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,610
And the same thing goes for this one.

94
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,070
Just reverse that terminology instead of the radius is going to be the same, because this is a circle

95
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:05,420
in all directions, radius is the same, and in case it starts from the center and it goes to any part

96
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,490
of the circle, but instead of the Y position in this case, we just talk about the exposition.

97
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,800
And I'm going to reiterate this one time because we need to dive into code when this center the distance.

98
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,950
Now, this this is touching it.

99
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,020
So the distance from the center of the circle all the way to circumference, which is touching this

100
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:31,520
canvas canvasses left side is going to be radius and the distance from the canvas has left side to the

101
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,940
center of the any circle anywhere.

102
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,860
That's going to be the X position.

103
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,190
When the X position is equal to the radius of the circle, it means that some touching has been has

104
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:50,930
occurred when the radius when the X position, you can see that the X position has been reduced by maybe

105
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,860
like almost a third and now the radius is still 50.

106
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,960
We can see that it's still even though it's it has moved off the canvas, but it is still 50.

107
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,940
And now in this case, the X position is lower or smaller than the radius.

108
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,710
When it is smaller than the radius, it means that the circle has moved off this canvas.

109
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,250
What is the amount?

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,300
The amount is the if you subtract the exposition minus the radius, you're going to get the exact amount.

111
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,240
But that's not something that we want.

112
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,490
We were just interested in the concept.

113
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:36,350
So we are going to say if the Y position of the circle is less than or equal to the radius, we are

114
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,450
just converting what I said into code.

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,720
We want to reposition it in the right direction so the Y position is going to be equal to the radius.

116
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,170
It can no, it can't go smaller than the radius because if if the Y position is smaller, it means that

117
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,180
the circle has moved off the canvas.

118
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,500
The same thing goes for the left position.

119
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,640
So left.

120
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:07,700
And the reason that I'm like emphasizing on this is because in our next project I have other stuff to

121
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,240
explain.

122
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,770
I'm not going to be going over this collision detection so many times.

123
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:21,080
And I'm reiterating myself and re explaining myself and saying the same things multiple times so you

124
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,190
can understand it in the next project.

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,040
We have other stuff to deal with and the collision detection part is actually going to be the easiest

126
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,050
part of game development.

127
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,210
It's the most important, but at the same time it's the easiest part.

128
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,270
It's just very simple logic.

129
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:46,850
So in the next projects, I'm going to be focusing more on other stuff rather than this collision detection.

130
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,180
And another example of this is now you can see that we create functions with ease.

131
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,120
Why is that?

132
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,420
Because we have talked about functions a lot.

133
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm not going to go over the syntax of how a function is created, how a function is called, because

134
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,780
we have already talked about it.

135
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,520
And that's why these lessons, they they make ideas on top of each other.

136
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,280
So in order to understand these lessons, you need to you need to have gone over all of the course.

137
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,440
So then you're going to understand what's happening here.

138
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,420
You can see we have statements, we have functions, we have function calls, we have game loops.

139
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,830
We have a lot of different stuff.

140
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,340
That's why those fundamentals with the intermediate and advanced level are so important, so moving

141
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,910
away from that discussion, if the exposition of the circle is less than or equal to the radius, the

142
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,450
same thing.

143
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:46,030
As for the top, we want to reposition that circle and it should never go less than the radius of it

144
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,870
that's come here.

145
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,890
So now we're going to go less than the radius.

146
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,530
There we go.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,160
So our project is done.

148
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,480
You can move it around.

149
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,220
So you think of it as your character and it can never move off the canvas.

150
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,640
See, it moves by DHS.

151
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:14,820
All right, so with this, our projects, our project of Move the ball comes Sternin in the next project,

152
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:22,980
we are going to create a bouncy orange in which we create an orange circle, look like look alike,

153
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,360
and then that is going to bounce off these walls automatically and we are going to code that logic.

154
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:37,050
So in each of these projects, you can see that we get more and more familiarized with how these games

155
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,740
they work.

156
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:47,310
And right after that, we are going to dive into our very first game, which is pong ping pong, and

157
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,730
that we are going to play against a powerful A.I. or artificial intelligence.

158
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,460
And I'm going to show you how you can create that.

159
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,930
I would just one line of code, right.

160
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,920
That's that's going to be a very, very, very cool project.

161
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,210
See you guys in the next chapter.

162
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,650
And that's it.
