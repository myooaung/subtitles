00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,800
In this lecture, we are going to talk about the array with this method.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:17,330
All right, so the reduced method executes a reduced function that you provide on each element of the

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,430
array, resulting in a single output value.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,510
So we are going to get a single output value right now.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,530
Let's go ahead and let's dive into this lecture so we have an array of numbers, one through five.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,920
Right.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,300
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable called total.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,290
And in here I'm going to call this arrays array and I'm going to I'm going to grab the array and I'm

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,320
going to call the reduced method on that array.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,060
So this method is going to call it is going to grab a callback function.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,150
The callback functions name is going to be some and there is going to be an initial value.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,620
All right.

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,690
So the initial value, I'm just going to pass in zero.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,170
Now, what it is that we are actually trying to do here, we want to grab this number zero.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,880
And each time the function grabs each of these values, each of the items of this array, we want to

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,790
combine their sum this with the zero.

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,200
So the first one plus zero, we are going to get one and then two plus the initial value of zero changed

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,140
from zero to one.

20
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,690
So this is going to be three and then three plus three.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,180
We are going to get six and then four plus six, we are going to get ten and then five plus ten we are

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,280
going to get 50, something like that.

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,720
All right.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,260
So what I'm going to do is let's go ahead and let's create the function.

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,010
The function is some right.

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,840
And we are going to have two parameters in here.

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,990
The first one is going to be a cumi accumulator and the second one is going to be value.

28
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,060
So the accumulator has it and an original value of zero.

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,410
Right.

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:11,150
And this value is going to be the value that is going to be passed by from this array into like in here.

31
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,860
Right.

32
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,260
And now what do we want to do when this function runs?

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,770
We want to return the accumulator plus the value.

34
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,590
All right.

35
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,730
So now let's oops.

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,240
Let's go ahead.

37
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,610
Now, we have created this function and we have called it here.

38
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,270
That's Longet to the console our results.

39
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,840
And let's see what what we are going to get so total.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,950
Let's save it.

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,650
We get 15 and I'm just going to do this one more time.

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:48,560
So in the first the first time that this callback function grabs the items from this array in the first

43
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:55,040
the first time that it does that the accumulator is zero because this is the original value of the accumulator

44
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,760
and the value is going to be one six zero plus one.

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,680
We are going to get one and this zero is going to return to one.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,740
And this is going to go on all the way to this to the final item, because before the final item, we

47
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,390
just have one plus zero.

48
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,210
We get one, then two plus one.

49
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,740
Remember, now this is one.

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,110
We get three, three plus three.

51
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,270
We get six for plus six.

52
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,040
We get ten.

53
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,520
Five plus ten.

54
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,530
We get 50.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,400
All right.

56
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,090
So this is the array reduced method.

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,000
See you guys in the next lecture.
