00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:09,700
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to talk about the replace method, Auri, so the replace

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,410
method is going to search and replace patterns within strings.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,330
So how do I mean, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say twenty eight point one.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,560
So this is this example has two parts.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,930
So example, twenty eight point one.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,040
Now, let's go ahead.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,730
We have let's say we have a sentence and I'm going to call it, you know what, just sentence.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:43,030
And I'm going to say my I don't know, like dog meows my dog Max.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,780
And let's create the regular expression Reg Rage twenty eight point one.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,820
I don't think point one works.

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,570
I'm just going to say Rage X, I'm just going to say rejects.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,020
Right.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:02,050
And now let's say I'm searching for miaows.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,980
Right.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,610
And I want to replace it with barks.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,630
So I'm just going to say replace text.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:19,360
So the replace text replacement text replacement text is going to be Bachs.

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:28,790
And now let's do the replacement, so I'm going to store it and I'm going to say replace result, right.

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,750
So we are going to grab our sentence because that's where we are looking and we are going to call the

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,100
replace method on it.

21
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,870
And whenever we call it, it says an object can search for and replace matches within a string.

22
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,490
So we are looking for something.

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,580
What is what it is that we are looking for?

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,660
First off, we need to provide that.

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,990
So I'm just going to say projects.

26
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:58,130
So we are looking for the regular expression and the regular expression is going to match a pattern

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,800
within that string and it is going to match.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,350
Miaows So we are looking for that.

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,860
What do we want to replace it with?

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,520
And it says replace value right here.

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,970
So what do we want to replace it with?

32
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,880
We want to replace it with the replacement.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,670
Replacement.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:27,070
Text, so let's go ahead and let's say Consul Deathlok very, very straightforward replies.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,100
Results, and when I say it, it says my dog barks, even though it's in here, it says my dog meows.

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,790
We've got the meow and we change it with the bark.

37
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,330
And we did the method and we logged it to the console.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,440
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you another example.

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,060
We can do it another way as well.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,930
So this is twenty eight point two.

41
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,430
And for this to work, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to you know what?

42
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,580
We don't need any of these.

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,040
So I'm just going to call them out and I'm going to say let replace.

44
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,120
Replacement, I'm just going to call it this time, replacement, nothing else.

45
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,440
OK, so a replacement be equal to now we insert our sentence here.

46
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,550
So I'm just going to say my cat barks.

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm going to say so this is our sentence.

48
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,650
Now, this is like a sure way of doing it.

49
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,140
And we are going to call a replace method on it.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,040
Now, here we call the replace by its variable name.

51
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,300
But in here we call the the sentence itself.

52
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,320
We are going to say that to replace.

53
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:44,360
So what what is what is it that we want to we are looking to replace, we are looking to replace Bachs

54
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,170
and what do we want to replace it with?

55
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,010
We want to replace it with MIAOWS.

56
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,490
So let's go ahead and let's say Kansa log replacement Servet and it says, my.

57
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,010
Cat meows So this is the end of our chapter for regular expressions.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,680
There could be like a ton more that if you wanted to really get in depth with this.

59
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,880
But I am not going to because I just give you like the necessary tools to create awesome regular expressions.

60
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:22,580
We are just focusing on forum validation and because we are going to have two projects in this area.

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,370
One of the projects is going to give you a strength for the password.

62
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,720
So it's going to be a password strengthened.

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,540
It is going to be an application.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,270
And the other one is going to be like whenever you're typing something inside the password, you're

65
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:46,880
going to get like life feedback like it is going to give you on this like on the spot.

66
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,250
When you're writing, while you're writing, you're going to get whether an error or not.

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,440
So we are going to do that with regular expressions as well.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,160
So this is it for this lecture and this chapter.

69
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,850
See you guys in the next one.
