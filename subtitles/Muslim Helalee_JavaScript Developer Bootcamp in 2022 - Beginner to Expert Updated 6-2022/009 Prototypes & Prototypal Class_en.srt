1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:07,430
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to talk about prototypes and prototype of class.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,380
All right, so before diving into prototypes, I just want to talk about instant's and instantiating.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,079
All right.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,910
So, for example, let's say we have a class of workshop workshop.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,390
Right.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:31,220
And in here, let's say we have let's just say we have a funt a function that is ASC and it is going

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,930
to get a question.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,500
It is going to get questioned as a parameter and it is going to do something.

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,410
I'm just going to right here do something right.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,900
It doesn't matter what it does.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,650
What matters is that we have a class of workshop right now.

12
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,290
What is an instance now?

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,320
An instance is when an instance is something that is created by the new keyword.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,750
Right, so the new if I were to say new workshop.

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:14,130
And open and close parentheses, this would mean that this is an instance of the workshop class right

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,930
now, what is this instance?

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,380
This instance is actually an object we know because we have talked about.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,810
Right.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,600
So.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:32,750
This object is an empty object that can grab the its of its properties and its methods, it can copy

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,750
them or it can link the properties and methods from the workshop class itself.

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,380
Right.

23
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,350
So it can copy the features of the workshop class.

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,280
All right.

25
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:53,000
So the new keyword is actually what's instantiating the class in JavaScript?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,980
All right, and this entire thing is called an instance, I'm just going to write an instance of the

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:11,310
class work of the workshop class or workshop class just like this.

28
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:19,870
This is an instance of the workshop class and what is instantiating a workshop class that is the new

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,530
operator.

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,870
I just I just wanted to talk about this.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
So this thing is instantiating this thing.

32
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:33,730
And this entire thing is called an instance of a workshop class.

33
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,880
It is an instance of anything that has been created there.

34
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:46,630
So if this were to be like anything else, for example, get posts or a like like post images, whatever,

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,910
whatever this class is, this is an instance of that class.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,710
OK, this is just an example here.

37
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,180
So I'm just going to comment this one out and we are going to come in here and I'm just going to come

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,140
and this back end.

39
00:02:59,570 --> 00:02:59,970
All right.

40
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,910
So we have talked about this sugar layer in our previous lectures.

41
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:11,050
We know what the syntactic sugar is and what is the extension beyond the syntactic sugar, which is

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,010
the super cure.

43
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,120
We know that.

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,100
We have talked about it and we know where we can use them and we know what the this key word is going

45
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,280
to point at because we know how the function is going to be called.

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:32,230
Now, this prototypes that we have used here, this is exactly the same as the class system that we

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,770
have used.

48
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,440
Right.

49
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,410
So this is called the like the layer underneath the sugar.

50
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,130
This this is what's actually happening.

51
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,070
OK, this is what the code will look like.

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:52,600
And you have to keep in mind that this is the old school way of doing a prototype or prototyping class.

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,640
And you can notice that we have a workshop function right here, OK, which is doing which is doing

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,020
the same thing as the class of the workshop class.

55
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,370
Right.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,190
It has the same purpose as this constructor.

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,120
Right.

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,500
And then we start adding methods to this workshop by saying workshop that prototype that as soon here

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,750
we added it directly inside of it.

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,210
But here we just said that prototype that ask.

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,260
Right.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:32,260
And we call the new operator right here on that on that specific function that we have created.

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,170
Right.

64
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,650
So you see some of the underpinnings of classes, but this is the system underneath and what's happening

65
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:47,560
in the class, sugar, it's not that you would really write this code anymore, because if you wanted

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,240
to do classes at all, you would almost certainly be using the class syntax.

67
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,850
You wouldn't write this prototypical code anymore.

68
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,820
But I think it is important for you to understand how this system actually works.

69
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:09,670
You have to understand what are what are what are the relationships, where are all these relationships

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:18,490
are coming from since they're not a copy paste operation, but they are a linkage operation?

71
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,150
OK, we need to understand how this code actually works.

72
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,410
The reason that we need to understand is because when the code breaks, we need to know why did it break?

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,500
Why did it do something different than we expected?

74
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,870
That's why we first we talked about the sugar layer, which was this classes, and now we are talking

75
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,170
about what makes up that class syntax.

76
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,200
And when we know both of them, we will be able to master object oriented programming and we will know

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,960
if if our code breaks, if there are bugs, we will know why.

78
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,620
Why are there bugs?

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,140
Right.

80
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:07,630
So what I'm going to do is we are just going to go ahead and I'm going to call the ask function.

81
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,700
On the jazz, and I'm going to call the ask function on Jank so we know that whenever we say new workshop,

82
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,500
this is an instance of the workshop class.

83
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,400
OK, so when we said this new operator, it instantiates.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,950
Right, a class instance.

85
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:37,300
So if I were to say Jayce dot ask here we have this key word inside this anonymous function, we want

86
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,570
to know what did this key word is going to point out.

87
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:47,140
So I'm going to say just ask and I'm just going to pass and is a great teacher.

88
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,700
Right now, before saving this, before saving it and coming in here, we need to take a look at this

89
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,240
closely and we need to find out whether this key word is going to point it.

90
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,720
So in order to find out whether this key word is going to point out, we need to go to the call site.

91
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:13,130
So here we have a function, which is ask let's go and let's find where the concert is for this function,

92
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,070
it's right here.

93
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,460
And from the call side, we will understand, OK, what the this keyword is going to point out.

94
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,370
So the call cites says that this ask is actually being called on a gess object.

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,220
So we know that the new keyword is going to create a brand new object.

96
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:39,400
So this is our this is our implicit binding method, which is also called the context object.

97
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,410
All right.

98
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,810
So this is the context object.

99
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:49,590
And if I come and if I see what's inside this context object, we can see that it is a an instance of

100
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:56,460
the new of the workshop class or in this case, function that has Teddy inside of it.

101
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,090
Right.

102
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,870
As an argument.

103
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:06,420
So this study is going to be passed where you're right and I'm going to change this question to I'm

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,960
just going to change it to DC, DC.

105
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm just going to say description.

106
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,940
Right.

107
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,550
The see.

108
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,200
All right.

109
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:22,800
So whenever we grab this right, it means that this is actually what the this keyword is going to be

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,440
pointing it.

111
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:31,860
So this teacher will actually be because Jesus is going to create a brand new object.

112
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,210
And inside of it, we are going to have a teacher.

113
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,679
Right.

114
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,799
This is where the teacher is coming from.

115
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,380
Right.

116
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,909
So this argument is going to be passed in here and then passed in here.

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,860
So this teacher is going to be a property of this new brand new object that we have.

118
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,460
All right.

119
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,010
And we know that this teacher is going to be referring to this teacher.

120
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,390
And when I say it, we are going to see that this study is a great teacher.

121
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,100
And if I come down here and say, concer log, let's take a look at the type of.

122
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:14,860
Type of J.S., we are going to see an object because this is an object and it is the same object that

123
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,540
links OK, people use people.

124
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Some people say coppice, but because JavaScript doesn't do copy pasting, it actually links.

125
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,970
There is a linkage relationship.

126
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:36,550
So this object is actually linked to the constructor that is creating this right to the instance to

127
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,460
which it belongs.

128
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,120
What is the instance in this case?

129
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,630
It is the workshop class instance that this object belongs to.

130
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,570
In this case, this just belongs to this workshop function.

131
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,600
Right.

132
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,970
So this is not actually a copy paste relationship.

133
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,020
This is a linkage relationship.

134
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:56,660
Right.

135
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,040
So if I were to go ahead and do the same thing for Jianguo, I would say let's call the Aske function

136
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,730
right.

137
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,320
And I'm going to say it is also a great teacher.

138
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,360
Right.

139
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,190
And now here we have this teacher and here we have this keyword as well.

140
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,810
Now the this keyword of this workshop has been called.

141
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,410
This workshop has been called in here and in here.

142
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,400
But now we are talking about the Jianguo part.

143
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,660
So whenever I call the workshop here and now A and DeJohn John is an argument which is going to be passed

144
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,820
inside this parameter and then we are going to pass it inside whatever the function needs to do.

145
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,240
So this teacher is going to be John.

146
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,980
So we know what this teacher is going to be, because when we if we want to find out that this key word,

147
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
what it points out, we need to go to the call side.

148
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,280
This is the calcite or this doesn't really matter.

149
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,400
But because we are talking about Jianguo, so this is the calcite.

150
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,780
And when we called the ask function, they ask also has this key word, what it is pointing out, we

151
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,890
need to go to the call side, which is right here.

152
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,080
So it is it has been called on the Jango object.

153
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,320
So the Janger object has a workshop function in this in this case or class.

154
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,930
You could call it class, a workshop class.

155
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:26,560
And this workshop class says this DOT teacher equals Stojan so that this key word is going to point

156
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,210
to John.

157
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,340
So we are going to see John is also a great teacher.

158
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,240
If I were to say that we can see that John is also a great teacher.

159
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,980
And if I were to say.

160
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,680
What is the type of Django we're going to get an object as well?

161
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:53,480
So now we know how this prototype system works and when we know how the prototype system works, we

162
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,800
know how the class syntax works.

163
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:56,900
All right.

164
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,060
So this is going to be paid for the prototypes and prototype class, right?

165
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,950
See you guys in the next lecture.
