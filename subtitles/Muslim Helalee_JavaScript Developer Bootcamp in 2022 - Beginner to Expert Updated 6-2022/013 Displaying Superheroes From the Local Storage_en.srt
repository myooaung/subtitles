00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,630
In this nature, we are going to display superheroes from the local stories to the UI.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,610
All right, so now you can see we have our superheroes inside this local stories, but they're not showing

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,350
on the UI.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,590
So what we are going to do is are going to create a function, display superheroes from L.A. and are

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,850
going to put static.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:32,500
And we are going to say display super heroes, display superhero.

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:32,860
Right.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,780
There is not going to be any parameter.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:43,000
So first off, where how can we grab superheroes from the local storage?

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,340
The method and the function responsible for that is the get superhero.

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,550
This is adding it.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,010
This is getting so we need to call this method.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,960
So for that, what we are going to do is we are going to say CONSED Superheroes list.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,440
So superheroes list.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,910
So let's create this.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,340
Now keep in mind, this variable is different than this because we are using CONSED.

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,920
This variable is code to this function.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,230
This variable is code to this function.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:22,910
And we are going to say the same thing, so store superheroes don't get superheroes, so we are going

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,670
to get the superhero when we get it.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,120
OK, there might be more than one.

23
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,070
We are getting an array of superheroes so we can call superhero.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,680
Let's start for each for each method on it.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,900
So let's remove the array.

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,340
And for each time we are going to call superhero.

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:52,640
What do we want to do when this array runs, when this array is iterating over, that we are going to

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,960
instantiate our superhero list class and we want to add the super we want to grab the add superhero

29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,090
method from there.

30
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:01,990
All right.

31
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,690
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to set instantiating the superhero.

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,160
OK, not upper superhero lest class.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:23,620
So for that, we are going to say CONSED list is going to be new superhero last and not that one, that's

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:31,810
incorrect superhero lest it's instantiated and when we instantiate it, then we can call a method from

35
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:31,870
it.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,830
So this is the difference between static and non static in non static.

37
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,790
You need to instantiate it first to be able to grab the superheroes and we're going to add superhero.

38
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,740
Let's add the entry.

39
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,710
So we just called the ad superhero and we just called the entry on it.

40
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,860
OK, sorry, not the entry, but the superhero.

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,200
OK, so and I'm going to come down here.

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,870
We are going to create a you know what?

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm just going to because this is an event I'm going to created here.

44
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,170
Now, this event is actually going to fire when the page reloads.

45
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,430
So that's why I've opened this up.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,500
This is Dom Cont'd Loaded event.

47
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,720
It fires when the initial e-mail document has been completely loaded and passed without waiting for

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,410
stylesheets, images of friends to finish loading.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,830
You can read all about it here.

50
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,860
OK, so I'm just going to this is dumb content loaded, right?

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,050
So we are going to say document.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:52,650
Document DOT at Evenflo Center, and we are going to say Dham content loaded when the DOMS content is

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,640
loaded fully.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,010
What do we want to load?

55
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,390
We want to load the store superhero store superhero darte.

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,380
Sorry, Dad, display the display superhero.

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,580
OK, so when the dom loads at that moment I want to load this method right.

58
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,670
This, I want to, I want to grab the superhero and from there I just want to call it whenever the dom

59
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:24,180
loads and when I call it what it is going to do, it is going to go into the superhero lists class and

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,170
from there it is going to call the ad superhero.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,250
And what is the ad superhero going to do?

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,920
So if we come up here, the ad superhero is going to do all this.

63
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,520
It is going to create a you'll create an ally, create an icon appended to the less data and it is going

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,670
to do all that stuff.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,130
So now let's come here.

66
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,580
So now you can see we already have all of our stuff here.

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,070
So if I remove everything from there and remove from here, let's add Superman, DC, fly, click,

68
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,520
everything is added and add it here as well.

69
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,570
Now, if I remove it from here, it's removed from here.

70
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,240
But if I reload, it is going to come back.

71
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,830
Now keep this in mind that we are not getting items from the local storage.

72
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,740
I mean that you could call this like a trick that we are doing here because we are not actually getting

73
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,400
items, because it's tricky to get items from the local storage and put it inside the UI.

74
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,930
For that, you need to create all this process once more.

75
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:39,480
So when you grab the item, you need to pass it and you need to grab the ID, grab the last grab, you

76
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:48,390
create a UL for it and create the inner HTML and then append it to that superhero less data div that

77
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,910
we have in the e-mail file.

78
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:58,360
So instead of doing all that, all that stuff, what we do is anything that's inside the local storage.

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,880
So where is it, anything that's inside the local storage, we just want to grab that local storage.

80
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,610
And so for example, if we have only Superman inside the local storage because inside the local storage,

81
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,050
we only have an object adjacent adjacent strength.

82
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,940
So let me bring this over here.

83
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,730
So we have only this Jason strain, this Jason's shrink.

84
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:33,750
The resume does not resemble this data that we have in order to, you know, grab it and pass it into

85
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,580
this data.

86
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,750
We need to run this function.

87
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,550
So we get that data, then we get the parent for that data.

88
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,450
This is the parent.

89
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,700
We create a UL for that data.

90
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,640
We create the inner e-mail for that data.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,270
And then from that data, we grab the superhero name superhero universe and superhero power and then

92
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,740
we add it to the screen.

93
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,400
So this is how we are actually doing it.

94
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,040
That's why I'm telling you that it's you could think of it as a trick that we are doing here, because

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,120
this trick actually allows us not to repeat ourselves.

96
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,900
So you could go ahead and do this trick here or instead of this, you could do all this.

97
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,320
So which one is better?

98
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,200
This one is better, right?

99
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,320
Just call the function.

100
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,310
Instead of doing all this, you could just go ahead and call.

101
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,090
And in order to call that function, you need to instantiate that class and then call it and pass in

102
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,780
the superhero.

103
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:40,650
OK, so this is how we completed this application will not actually complete it.

104
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,420
When I click remove from here, we need to remove that item from this from the local storage as well.

105
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,510
And that is going to be the ultimate thing that we want to do in this chapter.

106
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:02,460
I just want to go over this line one more time when the document receives an event and this event says

107
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,670
when the document is loaded completely.

108
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,490
We want to call this display superhero.

109
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,920
Function, the display superhero function is going to get all the items from the local storage and convert

110
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,730
them into the kind of data that we would want to display on our web, see.

111
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,340
So it's just grabbed it and converted it into this.

112
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,110
That's it for this lecture.

113
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,680
See you guys in the next one.
