1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,460
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we we're going to show and hide our different tabs.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,210
All right, so so the first first things first, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say income b10

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,950
you know what?

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,280
I'm going to go with the expense first doesn't really matter.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,410
But this is the way I've structured my code and I'm going to say event listener.

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,090
All right.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,900
So this is the expense event listener, the expense button and by the expense button, I mean this this

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,580
tab that we have selected.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,750
So this is the expense b10 tab one incompetent to all be tab three.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,510
So let's grab the expense BTN and we are going to add an event listener, the event is going to be kaleck,

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,990
so we are listening for a click event and then we are going to run a proper function.

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,800
So whenever we click on the expense button, let's first off see what should happen.

13
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:10,780
So when we whenever we reload the page, we can see that the all button it shows like here in this.

14
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,310
But when I click on the expense all button, it doesn't show anymore.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,010
It is like faded a bit.

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,800
The income tracker is faded a bit as well, but only the expense structure.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,870
So whenever we click on the expense side income and all, click on the income side expense and I'll

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,030
click on the all hyd expense and income sort of like that.

19
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:42,580
So we are going to call in a function and the function is going to be show and it is going to show the

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,740
expense element.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,550
So we are going to call in the expense element and it is going to hide.

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,100
Why is it doing this?

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,660
So it is going to hide.

24
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,010
It is going to hide what?

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,900
It is going to hide the income element and the all elements.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,680
Right.

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:06,780
And it is going to add we are going to call another function which is active.

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,220
Why does it do that?

29
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:16,720
So the active function and whenever we call in the active function, we say it should be as a parameter,

30
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,500
as an argument.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,570
We pass in the expense button whenever we create these functions, you know what I mean?

32
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,090
But for now, I just want to go ahead and do this.

33
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:35,890
And the inactive inactive is going to be inactive is going to be again, the income button, income

34
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,640
button and the all button.

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,330
So we want to activate the expense but expense button and deactivate the incompetent and the all button.

36
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,640
So this is the expense and listener.

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:04,020
All right, and we have two more event listeners as well, so the next one is going to be income.

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,410
I could just select all expenses and I could convert them into income.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,010
So whenever the income button is collect, I want to show income.

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,030
I want to hide expense.

41
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,780
Expense, right.

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,330
I want to hide expense here and expense Arment and all element.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,500
All right.

44
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:38,220
And I want to activate the income button and I want to deactivate the expense expense.

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,470
I want to deactivate the expense button and the all.

46
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,370
But and as far as the all is concerned.

47
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,650
Whenever we click on the old button, we want to show the old button, we want to deactivate the income

48
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,940
element, we want to hide the income element and the expense element.

49
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,570
And also we want to we want to make active the all button and also the active the expense.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,170
But here so we have created this event, listeners, what about their functions, whatever the show,

51
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:21,079
the hide, the active and the inactive functions, so these functions are what we are going to create

52
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:21,410
now.

53
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,100
We are actually going to create all four of them.

54
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,930
So I'm going to come down here and I'm going to call in.

55
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,930
I'm going to say show function.

56
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,590
All right.

57
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,170
So let's go ahead and let's create a function.

58
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,480
Let's name it show.

59
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,960
And we are going to pass in an element in here, all right.

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,760
OK, so we are going to grab our element, whatever that element is.

61
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,660
And we are going to say we are going to stop there.

62
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:01,670
We are going to grab their list of classes and we are going to remove the hide clause.

63
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,920
All right, so what is that element, the element in the case of expense button is the expense element

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,000
in the case of income button, that element is the income element.

65
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,110
In the case of the all button, it is the all element.

66
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,520
So let's come here.

67
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,470
So if I click on this, we can see the now the the income tracker is shown on the express track or is

68
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:25,800
shown.

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:34,190
But whenever I click on the income, so whenever I click on this, this should go away the all button.

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,300
I should only be seeing this income.

71
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,310
And when I click on the expense, the income and the all, they both should be hidden.

72
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,000
So let's create those functions as well.

73
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:54,690
The next thing that I want to do is I want to grab and I want to create the hide function, hide function,

74
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,730
and we are going to create a function.

75
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,180
And the name is height.

76
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,180
We are going to insert elements, not element.

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:11,220
And the reason for that is we have passed in two arguments inside an array like the structuring style.

78
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,010
And here that's why I'm just going to say aliments, because it refers to both of these two.

79
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:17,990
Right.

80
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,460
And inside this function, what I'm going to do is I want to grab our aliments.

81
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:32,050
Aliments, and I want to say for each we are going to use our for each method because there are an array,

82
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,500
right?

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,020
And I could do I could use this syntax, which is the arrow function syntax.

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,450
But I think this is a little bit confusing.

85
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,580
So we are just going to go through our regular syntax element.

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,890
So this element is the dysfunction parameter as well as this loop variable.

87
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:59,770
And we are going to say for each element that has been clanked, we want to add a we want to grab the

88
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,060
class list and add a class to it.

89
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,380
What is that class?

90
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,020
The class is high.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:13,480
And for the high side, if we remember correctly from our success says visibility heading so high,

92
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,000
I'd say that let's come here.

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,560
So when I click on this one, you can see that this is completely hidden.

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,290
All right.

95
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,680
You can see that everything is gone and now like all is gone.

96
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,220
Right.

97
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,740
But we need to fix that and we can fix that whenever we create the active function and the inactive

98
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,250
function.

99
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,370
So let's create the active function.

100
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,540
Very simple stuff.

101
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,330
So we have a function that is named active.

102
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,030
You're going to pass an element in here.

103
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,790
And whichever element that is, we are going to add a class list to it.

104
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,080
Don't add and that class list is going to be active.

105
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:04,930
And finally, let's create the inactive function and let's say function in active.

106
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:12,490
And we are going to because for the inactive, we still again, we have a set like an array.

107
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:20,140
That's why we are going to pass in elements and we are going to say aliments dot for each.

108
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:26,260
And whenever this for each loop runs, we are going to run a function.

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,680
The function R parameter is going to be element.

110
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,620
And whenever that function runs, what do we want to do?

111
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,510
We want to grab that specific element that we have clicked on.

112
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:48,480
So we want to grab that specific element and we are going to top their class list or their list of classes

113
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,160
and we want to remove.

114
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,480
Remove the active clause, let's save it.

115
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,600
Come here.

116
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,650
So now if I come here, if I click on the expense, we can see that this all is is getting removed.

117
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,760
Right.

118
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,060
Which it should not do this.

119
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,010
We are going to fix that.

120
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,470
We can see that it works for these two.

121
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,120
But what about this all?

122
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:21,130
So if I come here for the whenever I click on this, we are going to hide the whenever I click on the

123
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,050
expense, we are going to hide.

124
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:34,770
Hide the income element and the hide the all element, we are going to make activity and expense button

125
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,190
and deactivate the income button and the all button.

126
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:49,420
All right, and actually, this is not all aliment excuse me, this is all list, because the whole

127
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,510
element doesn't have anything inside of it.

128
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,610
All right, so if I come inside this all elements, so this is the all element.

129
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,960
But what we are going to do is we are going to grab the whole list because the list has that style to

130
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,160
it.

131
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,560
So where is this is the list?

132
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,940
This is the style for the old list.

133
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,980
Right.

134
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,690
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to my JavaScript, and so this is the all element we have

135
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,790
selected that because we need it as well.

136
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,250
But from here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all the all elements.

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,800
And you know what, I'm just going to select them one by one and I'm going to call all list.

138
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:43,870
All lest we want to hide the all, lest we do not want to hide the all element right in this case,

139
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:51,370
and I think and we want to show the all the list because we have hidden it.

140
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,210
We want to show it.

141
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,370
So now if I click on this, we can see still the is remaining here, so clicking, clicking, clicking,

142
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,380
everything is working properly.

143
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,880
Now, the reason you might ask, OK, why do we want to show the list?

144
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,550
But in the case of income, we want to show the all income element.

145
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,440
This is going to be answered through this e-mail.

146
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:23,090
So if I come here and let's go ahead and let's use two tabs, because this is a great use case for that.

147
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,390
So what is the expense element?

148
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,300
The expense element that's come here?

149
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,000
Has this is the expense tracker.

150
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,890
So for the expense element, we have selected this diff.

151
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,070
So this is the diff.

152
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,490
All right.

153
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:49,290
But whenever we set height, you can see that the H3 is actually out of this, if I said hi to the expense

154
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,830
itself, then the H3 is going to hide as well.

155
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,230
But we have set it to expand structure.

156
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,110
We want this expense structure to hide.

157
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,980
And whenever we click on the expense structure, we want the expense structure to show because the inputs,

158
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,470
they are inside that expense structure.

159
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,950
So this is the you know, you can see inside the all we don't have any inputs, but inside the expense,

160
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,010
we have three inputs inside the tractor income tracker.

161
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,870
We have three inputs whenever we click on this is three.

162
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,630
We want to see this whenever we click on this is three.

163
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,840
We want to see this whenever we click on this three, we want to see the list because this structure

164
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,720
is different for all.

165
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,100
We have a div, but we have three.

166
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:42,380
If I grab and if I say hide this, it is not only going to hide the list, but it is going to hide these

167
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,410
three as well.

168
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,080
That is the all elements you can see the whole element has an idea for which is this element.

169
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:57,870
And if I said the display hidden to this element divisibility hidden, then this H3 and this UL are

170
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,680
going to hide.

171
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,170
But I don't want these three to go away.

172
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,660
If it goes away, how can I switch back to it?

173
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,820
There is no element there, so I just want to hide the list.

174
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:15,660
Keep in mind, we just want to hide the list and the inputs associated with this list in case of the

175
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,350
trackers.

176
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
But in case of the all, we don't have any inputs.

177
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,070
That's why we are only in hiding the list itself.

178
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,390
Ariete.

179
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,800
I hope this is clear.

180
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,800
This is going to be it for this lecture.

181
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,490
See you guys in the next one.
