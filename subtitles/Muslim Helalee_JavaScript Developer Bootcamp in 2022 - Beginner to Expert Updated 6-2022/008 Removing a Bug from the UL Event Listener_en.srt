00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,670
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,939
In this lecture, we are going to create the complete to do and remove to do functions.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,970
All right, so what we have done is we have targeted the dynamically created to do items and I'm going

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,190
to show you one more time.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,400
So like.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:25,370
Hmm, like drinking, OK, drinking.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,770
OK, so if I just click on this, we can see it right here.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,280
So if I click here, it is going to say complete to do is not defined.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,200
And if I click here it is going to say remove to do is not define.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,360
Now these two errors, they are pretty normal because we don't have those functions defined yet.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,920
But there is another error that I'm worried about.

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:56,470
It's this one that it says uncute type error cannot read property value of undefined.

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,090
And if we click on this, it is going to bring us to where it is going to bring us to this to do status.

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,810
And I'm going to explain to you why we see this error.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,020
So when we have specified a word to do status, we said to do item, which is the item that we have

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,950
clicked on, and then we go inside the attributes of that item.

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,950
And from there we grab the status attribute and we get the value for the status attribute.

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,160
Now, this is fine, but where is the problem?

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,910
The problem is right here inside this dynamically created element.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,400
Now this I icon, this icon, this one has a status.

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:45,700
This one also has a status, but what about this paragraph, it doesn't have a status attribute, so

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,960
let's come into our e-mail.

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,160
What about this year?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,880
Well, it doesn't have a status attribute.

25
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,260
So let's go back to our JavaScript.

26
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,400
What about this elai?

27
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,790
It doesn't have a status attribute, so it doesn't matter what we click on, as long as it is.

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,430
As long as it's not.

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,259
The icon, as long as it's not these two icons, is going to throw an error.

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,669
How do we know that?

31
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,460
I'm going to show you how we know that.

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:21,710
So for simplification purposes, I'm going to come and tell these two and I'm going to hear cancel that

33
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,460
log.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,210
All right.

35
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,680
To do item.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,610
Let's go ahead and cancel the log to do item and let's see if it is going to throw anything.

37
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,530
So I'm just going to put in one, two, three.

38
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,280
If I click on this, we can see that we have clicked on an icon.

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,880
Let's refresh.

40
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,120
OK, just maybe like print something real.

41
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,500
So if I click on this trash, we have clicked on the trash icon.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,390
What if I click on this?

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,760
So this is our paragraph and I've just clicked on it and it shows that cannot read property value of

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,240
undefined.

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,370
It does not tell me where I have clicked.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,580
So for that to work because this consider log happens after the error, it's not executed.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,190
So I'm going to bring it here.

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,630
I'm going to bring it here.

49
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,530
And now this concept, the log has no idea what this to do item.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,570
So I'm just going to grab this and I'm going to put in put it right here.

51
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,110
If it a target.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,800
All right.

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:32,760
Let's save it now, let's create a writing center, click on this, we are going to get our icon, of

54
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,000
course, which has a status of complete.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,740
This one should have a status of delete.

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,610
But when I click on this paragraph, we do get the paragraph which says writing, but we still see this

57
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:44,970
error.

58
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,960
So clicking on the paragraph, we see an error.

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,980
Let's remove it.

60
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,610
If I click on the ally, it gives me an ally and we still see that error because the ally doesn't have

61
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,810
a status attribute and therefore there is no value for that.

62
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,190
That's why the value is undefined, right?

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,810
If I click here, it is going to give me a user because we have clicked inside the user.

64
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,060
We have not clicked on any elai, any icons or any paragraphs.

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,120
And and the UN doesn't have an attribute of status.

66
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,830
Hence the value is undefined because there is no status.

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,170
There is no value for that.

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,530
So what do we have to do is we have to make sure that we cover this corner corner, we cover this.

69
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,980
We like let's say we debug it, OK?

70
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,850
We remove this book from our application.

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,230
So for that one, I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to implement an if statement.

72
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,970
I mean, what is better than an if statement to be able to control the flow of our application?

73
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,640
So before even like doing this if statement, I'm going to show you something very, very cool that

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,050
you can do with events.

75
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,620
But what the exact event object did working with.

76
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,640
So I'm just going to consider log given.

77
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,020
I'm not going to say target, I'm just going to consider log the event itself.

78
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,450
So I'm going to say walking.

79
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,480
And when I click on this, we do get an error.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,410
But that's not the point.

81
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,120
The point is we get all this information from this all this information.

82
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:30,420
What I found out was what I found out to be the most exciting was this path for this specific bug that

83
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,710
we have in our application.

84
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,210
So we get this path.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,920
So whenever inside this event, we want to grab some property of that event, we can access that through

86
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,250
the dot notation so we can just say path, dot path, hence the evt.

87
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,950
The target target is a property of this event object event.

88
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,700
As an object.

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,230
Each object has a specific set of methods and properties.

90
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,820
You can access them through the dot notation or through the back bracket notation.

91
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,080
We have talked about this, right?

92
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
So I want to target the path.

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,270
I want to grab the path.

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,910
So I'm just going to say Evett dark path.

95
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,090
This is the same as the E or as the event that we have used before.

96
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,280
So here we have set it to event.

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,190
It doesn't matter if you write event, if you write evt or if you write it is going to work.

98
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,020
Right.

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,730
I don't think we have used E in this application.

100
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,480
Of course, in our previous applications we have used E a ton.

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,350
So it's it is going to work the same way.

102
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:41,310
So now if I create another one and if I click on this, it is going to give me the path, the path that

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,870
I showed you.

104
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,240
Now you guys can see that this seems like indices.

105
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,880
These seem like indices as says zero, one, two, three, whatever.

106
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:58,020
But the zero index is where is what is when I have her on it, it is going to highlight this paragraph.

107
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,630
So let me show you one other cool thing.

108
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,840
So if I click inside the user and if I come hover over this, well, it is going to highlight this entire

109
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,250
area.

110
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,770
So through this path, ensure through this path, we can know for sure.

111
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,970
What is it?

112
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,610
What is it?

113
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,610
Was it what is it exactly that we are clicking on or that the user has clicked on?

114
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,530
So if I click on this, we are going to get the exact icon that we have clicked on.

115
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,020
I mean, this works like path, but in a much better way in my opinion.

116
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,160
So if I click on this trash, we are going to get the trash well, with a lot more info.

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,820
Now, this info is the tree, the the parent tree or the ancestor tree for this element.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,330
So the first parent is going to be alive.

119
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,480
The second one is going to be well then content and container, then body, then HTML, then document.

120
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,230
Right.

121
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,720
So these are the ancestral tree of this element which we don't want to do.

122
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,330
We don't have any thing to do with those.

123
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,090
We just want the first this one, the index of zero, the exact item that we have collected.

124
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:15,320
How does this help us and helps us in in and writing in our logic, so we are going to say if now here

125
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,650
we are going to use our logical operators.

126
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,230
So I hope you have practiced them a lot.

127
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:28,460
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say Evett Dutt if event dot path now how to how we can access

128
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,390
index through the bracket rotation notation.

129
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm just going to put in zero because as I told you guys, we are interested in the first item.

130
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,860
The first item has an index of zero and from there we are going to grab the local name.

131
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,210
I should have shown you the local name as well, which I'm going to show you in a sec.

132
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,060
So I'm just going to come in this one out.

133
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,620
I just want to show you all our.

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,010
All of the like like the route that we are going to go through and then apply that, so we were up to

135
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,080
her path and then we are going to grab the first item.

136
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,180
And from there, I'm going to show you, you know what I'm just going to show you here it's not going

137
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,150
to take long.

138
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,940
What cooking?

139
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,150
Still the same thing, instead of removing one, I even added one, so.

140
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,390
OK, so if I come here now, you can see that we get our paragraph, which is the element that we have

141
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:28,950
clicked on.

142
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,390
So if I click on this, we get an I click on this, we get another, I click on this, we get our ally

143
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,080
click on this, we get our viewer if I remove this.

144
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,630
And come here and right, walking properly this time and click on this, we can see that we get all

145
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,070
the information that we talked about.

146
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,330
So now let's click on this and the first items index, which is zero.

147
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,530
And if we come down, we are going to see something very, very interesting.

148
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,430
And that is the local name.

149
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,960
So the local name is actually the aliment name that we are looking for.

150
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,180
So the way that we are going to implement this logic is that if the local name is a paragraph.

151
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,650
So let's try this.

152
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,640
Let's click on this.

153
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,780
Let's come here.

154
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,470
Now, you guys can see we get errors in three situations.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,610
One, when the local name is a paragraph, two when the local name is lie right here, and three, when

156
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,960
the local name is you.

157
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:38,560
Well, so in these three scenarios, we get an error, but when the local name is an icon or another

158
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
icon, we don't get an error.

159
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,540
So we need to take these three out of this equation through an IF statement.

160
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,630
That's how simple it is.

161
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:54,620
So for the paragraph, we should be able to see a local name, whereas l come buddy.

162
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,380
So the local name is the element tag.

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,140
This is what we can use to our advantage that's collapsed this.

164
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,640
Let's expand this one.

165
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,820
So for this, the local name should be illi.

166
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,780
And a local name.

167
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,930
Yes, the local name is Elide, the Element name, and I'm going to show you the U.S. so your mind is

168
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,770
at rest.

169
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,390
All right.

170
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,600
Where is the local name, the local name as you are?

171
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:30,490
So what we are going to do, we are going to say is if so, now let's delete this so that local names.

172
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,000
So let's come in this back.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,500
And so we are going to say if the local name equals P or I'm just going to copy this for F or if the

174
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:51,560
local name equals Elai or if the local name is person or logical operators, or you will.

175
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
What do we want to do?

176
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,550
We want to return from the function and this return key is a very, very interesting one, because if

177
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,690
even one of these three conditions is true, then it is going to return and none of the following code

178
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,550
is going to run.

179
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:18,080
This is this is how we can control the flow of logic so the logical operators can also be changed as

180
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,350
well.

181
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,110
So you can use like technological logical operators in one sentence and one has not signed and in one

182
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,760
line of code.

183
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:33,410
So this logical operator says that if either of these three is true, then if the condition of this

184
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:40,670
if statement is going to evaluate to true, hence we are going to return from this function, meaning

185
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,400
none of this code is going to run, none of them.

186
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,610
So let's see that in action.

187
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,500
So I'm just going to consider log one, two, three.

188
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:56,210
So if one of these if statement if one of the logic, one of the sides of this logical operator is expression

189
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,670
is true, the condition of the statement is going to evaluate to true and we are going to return from

190
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,240
the function.

191
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,420
It means that this constant lock should not.

192
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,150
Like run, if this condition is true, the council should not run, this kind of luck only runs when

193
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,820
these conditions, all three of them are false, even if one of them is not true.

194
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,430
Sorry, even if one of them is true, this consular should not run.

195
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,470
All right, so this is the most difficult part.

196
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,460
So if I click on this, we can see that the console log runs.

197
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,790
If I click on the reading, we don't see the console log run.

198
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,020
So let's click on the reading.

199
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,190
The console log doesn't run.

200
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,510
Click on the like.

201
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,680
The console log doesn't run.

202
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,550
Click on the URL.

203
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,830
The console doesn't run.

204
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,680
We want we wanted to run in only two situations.

205
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,230
One, this one and then this one.

206
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:58,000
So you can see that we have run it for two times so we can say this and then trash it.

207
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,820
And if I click on this and we are going to trash it.

208
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,940
So through this statement, we were able to remove those errors that we used to see.

209
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,860
I don't I mean, those errors, they didn't have a negative effect on the applications overall performance.

210
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,640
It is not it's not like a good thing to have in the background there.

211
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,130
I don't want to have any errors there.

212
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:28,750
So I know I called this lecture to create the room complete to do and remove to do functions, but this

213
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,150
was actually to remove a bug.

214
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,770
So in the next lecture, we are going to create our complete to do and remove to do functions.

215
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,570
See you guys in the next lecture.
