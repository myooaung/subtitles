00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,719
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,740
In this letter, we are going to cover while Louise.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:15,350
All right, so we have talked a lot about for a loop so far, but there is actually another way of implementing

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,950
loops in JavaScript as well, and they are called while loops.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,060
Now, while loop syntax is different than the if statement that it started and then the full loop syntax.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,680
Right.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,960
But the functionality is the same.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,729
They basically implement the same thing.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,460
All right.

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,780
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a multiline comment here.

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,810
And this is just for your reference.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,220
And whenever you want to create a wire loop, first stuff, you have to declare a variable.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,560
Now, the loop variable is declared outside the loop itself.

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,130
All right.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,160
And then you write the wire loops keyword.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,860
And in here you're going to have a condition.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:01,970
All right.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,110
And when the condition is true, you're going to run it.

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,380
For example, run run the code or whatever.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,160
Right.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,900
So when the condition is true, you run the code, right.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,910
So think of this more like an F statement.

23
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,340
All right.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,220
So you have the you have the variable declared outside.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,330
And as long as the condition is true, you run the code.

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,050
And where is the instrumentation?

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,440
Decru and mentation comes after you run the code.

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,080
Right.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,460
So at this point, you just go ahead and increment the variable like a variable, for example.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:37,820
Plus.

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,180
Plus.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,710
Right.

33
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,490
So it comes after that.

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,220
You separate it like that and you put it here.

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,600
All right.

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,860
So I'm just going to provide it with some space.

37
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,830
I hope it sticks.

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,730
Yes, it does.

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,510
All right, so let's go ahead and let's create ourselves a while, so I'm going to give you two examples,

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,280
right?

41
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,450
So this is our example, number one.

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,080
So now, first off, we have to declare a variable.

43
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,880
So we are going to say, well, it can't be equal to one now.

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,690
That's right.

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,169
The key word for the while loop.

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,430
And let's create the syntax first.

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,940
So this is a while now inside the parentheses, we have a condition.

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,100
So what is the condition?

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,020
What do we want this loop to do?

50
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,650
Or or actually what we wanted to do?

51
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,520
It comes inside the curly braces.

52
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,320
How many times do we want this loop to run?

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,290
Actually comes inside the parentheses.

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,400
So we want this loop to run, for example, for ten times.

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,600
So we said as long as the K is less than or equal to 10.

56
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,350
So so when that condition, which is as long as care is less than or equal to 10 is met, what do we

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,870
want to do?

58
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,870
We simply want a council log, a work variable.

59
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:04,780
And after we do that, because the key variables value at first, initially, it is going to be one,

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,650
it is one.

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,030
And then the concept of log is going to say one, that's it.

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,660
And then we have to increment it either by one or by any other unconventional method that we have studied

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,290
so far.

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,270
All right.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,050
So now when when we incremented and when we save the code, we are going to see this.

66
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,240
All right.

67
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,280
So the loop starts from one, goes to two, all the way to ten.

68
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,940
So how does actually this work?

69
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,170
So the variable value is going to be one at first.

70
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,240
All right, so when it is one, it is checked against this condition.

71
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,020
So one is less than 10.

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,570
All right.

73
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,000
So this condition holds true when the condition holds true.

74
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,300
This code is going to run.

75
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,080
Right.

76
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,740
So this code, when this code runs, we are going to get one because initially the value is one and

77
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,220
then that one is going to be incremented by one.

78
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,440
So one plus one, we are going to get two.

79
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,120
So two is going to be evaluated against this condition again.

80
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:14,780
And then we are going to get like this condition is going to be true because two is less than 10.

81
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,720
And again, this code is going to run inside this curly braces and then we incremented again by one

82
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,750
and then two plus one is going to be three.

83
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,050
OK, so, so, so forth and so on until we get number 10.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,250
So this is how a while loop is created and how it works.

85
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,560
So let's go ahead and let's take a look at while loops.

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,520
Let's take a look at an array and let's see how we can iterate over that array or through that array

87
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,990
using a while.

88
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,360
All right.

89
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,670
So in the second example, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an array and I'm going to say

90
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:56,000
Kohn's colors and I'm going to provide it with the RGV.

91
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,100
All right, Red.

92
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:07,570
This is going to be green and RGV, this is going to be all right, so let's go ahead and let's declare

93
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,210
the variable for a loop.

94
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,080
But and that loop variable is going to loop through this array.

95
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,530
Right.

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,680
So this is not the loop variable.

97
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,060
This colors is actually the array itself.

98
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,680
Right.

99
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,910
So we are going to declare a loop variable this time.

100
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm just going to call it I.

101
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,420
All right.

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,260
And we are going to say, while a condition holds true, run the following code.

103
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,790
So what is the condition?

104
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:41,170
We want the AI to go all the way to less than not equal, less than colors that length.

105
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,480
So the concept is the same.

106
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,110
The concept of condition, part of the wire loop and the for loop is the same.

107
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,740
And we know that so far.

108
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,060
Right.

109
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:59,980
And when that holds true, when that holds true, we want to log to the console, the eye variable itself.

110
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,760
And when it is logged, we want to incremented by one as well.

111
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,710
So we are going to get the index of zero, the index of one and the index of two.

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,590
Lets copy it down below and commented out.

113
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:19,290
Let's take a look at the numbers and sorry, it is the colors, array colors and let's put in our Ivanovo

114
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,260
so.

115
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,260
In the first iteration, the four is the first index, which is zero.

116
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:34,430
We are going to get red and then green and then blue, OK, we can also go through one another example

117
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,900
as well where we just get the color names, OK?

118
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,810
So without any index or anything.

119
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,680
So this is how one loops work in JavaScript.

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,670
And and I think that set for this lecture.

121
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,950
So see you guys in the next one.
