00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,940
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create a correct answer function and incorrect answer

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,540
function.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,980
All right, so we know why and by now we know what the user has clicked on.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,400
All right.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,200
So let's go ahead and let's implement some logic based on that.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,010
So we are going to say if the answer equals if the answer equals questions.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:37,970
Now we want to evaluate the user's answer against the correct answer, that the correct answers, key

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:45,530
value pair inside the object, which is an item of an array of questions.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,620
Right.

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,810
So right away when I write these questions, we are we have access to this to this object, which is

11
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,850
inside this array.

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,830
So inside this object, we have a question that is a string question, a string.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,400
Everything is basically a string.

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,080
But what is inside this entire list that is really useful for us?

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,950
It is the correct answer.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,990
But before going to the correct answer, we should know what is the answer that the user is currently

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,980
is currently working on?

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,020
What is the question that the user is currently working on?

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,770
So, for example, if the question is question number five, we need to check this answer and yes,

20
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,570
against the correct answer for the question number five.

21
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:39,170
So before even accessing that array, we need to know what is the active question that the user is actively

22
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,230
trying to answer.

23
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,990
So after we have found out the index of that question from there, we are going to grab our correct

24
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,450
answer.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:57,320
So if the answer that we pass on inside this parameter that that is going to be passed and instead of

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,720
this parameter, which is going to come from right here, which we know how we got it.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:12,090
If that is accurate, sorry if that is equal to the correct answer for that specific question, we want

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:20,820
to grab our Oscar and we want to incremented by one right now, we have we have created the score and

29
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,170
the initial value for the score is zero.

30
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,130
This is this.

31
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,450
Where is the score?

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,120
I don't think we have created it.

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,790
So let's go ahead and let's create it down here.

34
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,570
So let's say let's score be equal to

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,700
zero.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,740
Now, this score is the score that we are going to show when all the questions are done.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,880
So first off, we want to increment that score because the score has a value of zero.

38
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,440
When the user answers one question correctly, the score is going to be one.

39
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,480
This is how we add it behind the scenes.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,540
Beats are right.

41
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,060
And the next thing that I want to do here is I want to call two functions here.

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,890
So the first function is going to be answer.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,000
Insur is correct.

44
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,970
I want to call in dysfunction, if the answer is correct, we are going to call the answer is correct

45
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,730
function or else we are going to what is this Lisse else?

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,000
Else we are going to call the answer.

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:35,420
Is incorrect function, all right, so we know that we should call this function.

48
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,530
So why do we want to call these functions?

49
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:45,470
Because because each of these functions is responsible for providing this box with a different color.

50
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,050
So answer is correct.

51
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,240
Is going to change the background of that box to green and answer is incorrect, is going to change

52
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,550
the background of that box to red.

53
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:02,800
So now let's go ahead and let's say the answer is correct function.

54
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,980
Let's create this function, let's say function answer is correct.

55
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,530
And sir is correct.

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,800
All right, so what do we want to do, we want to grab that element, so we are going to say document

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,280
dot, get element by I.D. and I'm going to tell you why.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,410
Get Element by Biden.

59
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,200
And in here, I'm going to pass on the active question.

60
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,620
Dot styled, dot background color.

61
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:44,280
Where is the background color and let's change it to very solid green, so why not go and buy it?

62
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,000
If you remember correctly, this is where we created those 10 boxes.

63
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,510
They have a class of progress box which we styled and see assess, which should be right here.

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,170
This is that.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,700
And they have an I.D., which is a number.

66
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:09,600
Now, the number of that IED starts from zero, goes all the way to question index less than the last

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,170
question or equal to it, and then it increments it by one.

68
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,500
All right, so if the last question is, for example, of course, the last question is nine or eight,

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,870
it has an index of nine, which we have created right here.

70
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,640
Last question.

71
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,690
It was the first necessary variable that we created.

72
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,720
So it is nine.

73
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,280
So first off, the question index is going to have a value of zero.

74
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,000
Then this condition is going to run, which is true, and then this code is going to run.

75
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,680
So when this code runs inside this IED, we are going to pass and what we are just going to pass in

76
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,050
zero.

77
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,610
So the idea of this entire thing is going to be zero.

78
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,430
All right.

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,730
And this is a div.

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,570
So what we do here is we say that we want to find an element whose ID is the active question.

81
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,250
And whenever we are talking about the first progress box, it means that we are talking about the first

82
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:14,720
active question, because if I come here, the active question by default has a value of zero.

83
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,410
And then we increment that active question right here.

84
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,350
We get the active question in here, which is zero.

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,160
All right.

86
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,860
And let's come down here.

87
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,780
Where is the active question?

88
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,710
Where else we have?

89
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,460
We used it.

90
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:38,660
So last question, active question is going to be zero, we we set the active question to be the index

91
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,420
of the array items inside the questions, right.

92
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,730
So let's just highlighted and check for it.

93
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,830
I'm just going to do this.

94
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,850
And here is the active question, the correct answer.

95
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,510
All right.

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,980
And then we get the active question that started that background color green.

97
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,910
Right.

98
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,170
And we are going to do the same thing for answer is incorrect.

99
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:14,860
And sir is incorrect, so let's call that function and let's create the function answer is incorrect,

100
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,610
and when the answer is incorrect, we simply change it back to read.

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,760
Let's save it.

102
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,620
Let's check it out.

103
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,040
So if I click if I click on this, this is red because of course, 150 is incorrect.

104
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,660
The correct is 100 and now it is red.

105
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,760
Sorry, it is green.

106
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,630
So red, red, green, red, green, red, green.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,350
All right.

108
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,860
Now there are a lot of a lot more things that are still remaining.

109
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,150
Right.

110
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,020
And we are going to do them in like one after the other.

111
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:52,000
So for example, whenever we click on either the correct answer or they're incorrect answer, we want

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
to go to the next question.

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,100
And the next question is going to be a function that we have not created yet.

114
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,890
So what I'm going to do is to be able for us, for our active question to make even more sense.

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,150
We are going to go to our next lecture in which I'm going to create finally the next question function,

116
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:20,260
which is going to like some everything to like it is going to summarize everything that we have done

117
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,860
so far.

118
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:27,460
Well, not everything like 95 percent of what we have done so far is based put on the shoulders of the

119
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,330
next question.

120
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,310
See you guys in the next lecture.
