1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,670
Hi, everyone in this actually working to dry the canvas aliments.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,060
All right, so we have selected our canvas here and we have got the context and these are the canvas

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,110
dimensions, the first thing that I want to do is going to be drawing the canvas.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,540
Now we are going to draw the canvas right here, OK?

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,700
And I'm going to create a function.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,510
All right.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,570
And I'm going to call this function, draw Recht.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,680
Right.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,320
And it is going to grab an X position.

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,240
A Y position.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,570
We know all this, right.

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,580
The A with

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,660
a height.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,570
And also a caller, right?

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:53,570
So this is going to be our canvas now, we're going to initialize our canvas with the canvas context

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:04,700
and we're going to say Phil style and let's set it to color and then canvas context, dot, fill, ract,

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,020
fill, rect.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,730
And this is going to grab a horizontal position, a vertical position, the width of the canvas and

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,150
the height of the canvas.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,320
So this is going to be the first element of our game.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,920
The second element of our game is going to be drawing a circle, which is going to be the ball.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,750
Right.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,800
And so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say function.

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,370
We are not going to call these functions just yet.

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,420
When we get to our game loop, we are going to call these functions there.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,260
All right.

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,790
So we are going to say function, draw, circle, draw, circle.

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:53,720
All right, and this is going to accept in exposition a Y position, a radius and a color.

29
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,600
So inside here we're going to canvas context, Phil style, Phil style.

30
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,050
What is it going to be?

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,180
It is going to be the color that we pass.

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,570
And now let's open our let's begin the path.

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,600
So I'm going to say begin path.

34
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:21,800
And for drawing the circle, we have the ARC method, which is going to grab an X position, a Y position,

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,180
a radius.

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,690
The starting angle is going to be zero.

37
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,070
The ending angle is going to be math dot pi times two.

38
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,740
And then finally we are going to say canvas.

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,780
Context that fell, all right, so we have successfully drawn our circle as well.

40
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,490
We're not going to see anything because we haven't called these functions yet.

41
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,010
So I'm going to I'm going to draw the text as well.

42
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,520
So I'm going to say drawing the.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:06,680
OK, so drawing the text and I'm going to say function, draw text, draw text.

44
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,660
And what is the content of the text?

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,690
Let's put it there.

46
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,100
What is the horizontal position?

47
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,160
What is the vertical position of the text and what is the color of the text?

48
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:26,350
So in order to draw text with canvas, first off, we are going to grab our context, canvas context,

49
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,770
and we are going to basically the first style is going to be the same.

50
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,440
So it is going to be the color that we have.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,380
And then we can we have to say that what is the font properties of that color?

52
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:45,640
So that text so I'm going to say 25 pixels is going to be the size or initially it was twenty five.

53
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm just going to increase it to 35 so it's better visible.

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,640
So this is the font size and sans serif is different family.

55
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,940
This is how you create fonts and canvas.

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,310
And finally, we are going to say, as with circles that we say fell for this one, we should also use

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,690
some sort of fell method.

58
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,150
And it is called fill text.

59
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:15,440
And fill the text with the content, with the position of X and position of Y.

60
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,589
Right.

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,230
So this is going to be a four hour draw, a text function.

62
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,740
The next function that I want to draw here is going to be the next thing that I want to draw is going

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,540
to be drawing the net.

64
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,910
Right.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,940
And for that, let's come down here, let's say function and it's going to be draw net.

66
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:47,190
No parameters in here, and we are going to say basically whenever we draw the net is we are going to.

67
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,180
So let me come here to our original game that we have so you can see that we have multiple iterations

68
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,730
of this line, which seems to be like we seems to have like all of these lines.

69
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,230
They have the same height.

70
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,000
Right.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,250
So what we are going to do is whenever we create this.

72
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:13,130
So if I zoom out, because the start of this top, this is canvas height equals zero.

73
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,500
So whenever the canvas is height is equal to zero, we are going to start our first line.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,550
And the second line is going to start when the canvas height is 15 pixels.

75
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,550
The height of this line is ten pixels.

76
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,000
So 10 pixels minus this entire space, which is I'm going to zoom in so you can really see.

77
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,500
So from here to here is ten pixels from here, all the way to the edge of the next line is 15.

78
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,170
So what is this space?

79
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,260
Five pixels.

80
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,260
That's how we calculate it.

81
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,600
Right.

82
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,770
So I'm going to zoom out.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm going to zoom back into nine to one hundred percent.

84
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,190
So we are going to say four led because we don't want to repeat this function like maybe 100 times for

85
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,090
each of the lines.

86
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,120
We just want the loop to take care of it.

87
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,080
We are going to say that the loop is going to start from zero, which is the top side of the canvas.

88
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,930
At that point, the canvas is height to zero.

89
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,180
So it is going to go to all the way to canvas element that height.

90
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,590
Where is this?

91
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,520
Whereas canvases and the height, it's this bottom part.

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,610
So this is going to be the canvas element at height, this bottom part.

93
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,460
Right.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:29,750
And how do we incremented we incremented each time by now and here we're not going incremented by one

95
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,020
working tormented by 15 pixels.

96
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,690
So the first line is going to be at the canvas height zero.

97
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,050
The second line is going to be at canvas height 15.

98
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,150
The third line is going to be at canvas high thirty.

99
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,330
And the gaps that we end up with is going to be five pixels because the line itself is going to be ten

100
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,900
pixels.

101
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,960
And in here we are going to say draw Recht and let's grab this method.

102
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,530
Now, the reason that I've just specified this to draw, not the draw canvas, is because whenever we

103
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,210
draw those lines, there are two rectangles so we can use this function.

104
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,280
If we draw a canvas that's a tangle.

105
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,420
We can use this function.

106
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,960
We can use this function for our panels as well, because our models are also rectangles.

107
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,350
So we just create one function, one utility function, and we reuse it many times over.

108
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,550
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to call that function and I'm going to say that the net

109
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,110
which we are, which we are yet to create the net object's exposition.

110
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:44,420
And then the net objects y position, we will be creating these nets as well, right, and then the

111
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,150
Y position is going to add on the AI or the variable.

112
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,000
So that's how we get that dashed line.

113
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,700
Then we are going to send net worth and a net dot height.

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,040
And finally, next door to color, right, so we have successfully created these and if I come here.

115
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,730
There we go.

116
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,230
So there are no errors yet.

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,100
I'm just going to put it to the bottom.

118
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,740
All right, I'm just going to put it here.

119
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,810
And in case there is something that I need to show you there.

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:27,450
OK, so all of these are spelled perfectly correctly, the next step that that is the logical step that

121
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,850
we should do as I'm going to create an object for the players paddle.

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,640
Right.

123
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,080
So for this panel, I'm going to create an object, another object I'm going to create for the aeppel,

124
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,780
another object I'm going to create for the ball.

125
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,040
And the fourth object is going to be for the net.

126
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,820
And why do we need objects?

127
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,300
Because I'm going to store inside them some properties.

128
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,630
For example, the height of this paddle, the width of this part of the X position, the Y position,

129
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,120
the color, for example.

130
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,990
What else do we have?

131
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,920
And also the score, all of them are going to be stored within that object so we can reused instead

132
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,320
of riding those properties over and over and over again, we just create objects and we reuse objects.

133
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,670
So that is what we are going to do in the next lecture.

134
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,980
See you guys then.
