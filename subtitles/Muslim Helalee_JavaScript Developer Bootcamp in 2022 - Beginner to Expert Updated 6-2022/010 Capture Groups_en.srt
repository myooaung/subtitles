00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,010
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,300
In this lecture, we are going to talk about capture groups.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:15,790
All right, so what are capital groups now, capital groups that allow us to group patterns that we

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,520
are looking for now in our first example in here?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,320
What do we want to do?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,120
Is that so let's let me go ahead and let's create the sentence.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,880
So I'm just going to say book and I'm going to say book one more time on buck book.

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,570
And in this case, we are looking for the word book that appears to eyes in a stronger line, in this

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,260
case, strength.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,750
And there is a space between the two occurrences of the word book.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,530
Right.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,300
So how would you use capture groups now, the syntax for a capture group and.

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,170
Well, I should provide our example.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,170
So this is example 27.

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,060
All right.

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,450
And these are capture groups.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:12,720
OK, so capital groups are just try this, the syntax for them is a parenthesis, a set of parentheses.

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,120
So I want to say I want to grab all of the characters, all of the characters.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,690
Right.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,570
And that have one or more occurrences, hence the plus.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,690
And then we are going to say there is a space there.

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,280
Right.

23
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,130
So this cultural group is going to grab this book.

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,720
Then we have a space.

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,730
That's why I provided the space there.

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,120
And then what I want to do is I want to repeat this entire thing one more time.

27
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,410
That's why there is one.

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:50,530
This is not L, this is L, but this is actually the number one on the keyboard.

29
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,340
All right.

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,420
So now let's go ahead and let's now I've created it here.

31
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,570
Now, there are two ways that we can work with this.

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,650
The first one is we are going to test it.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,890
So let me go ahead and create a regex test result.

34
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,650
So this is regular expression test and this should be capitalized test results.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
And I'm going to grab a regular expression, number 27.

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,350
Right.

37
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,380
And we are going to test the sentence.

38
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:35,170
Sentence and after that, we are going to log it to the council, so if this pattern is correct, we

39
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,590
should be able to which we should, which we do not do.

40
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,710
We should we do it means that what does this actually mean?

41
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,660
So for this to make sense says, I'm going to explain this one more time and I'm going to say that this

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,190
Capital Group is going to be applied on this book.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,610
It is going to find this book within the strength, because this says all all the characters and zero

44
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,810
more or occurrences occurrence of them, which we have four occurrences of that.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,300
But this space says space.

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,250
And this one, it basically repeats this capture.

47
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:18,020
So there is no difference between that and this that I'm about to ride in here.

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,250
So if you're writing like this or if you write it like this, there are not there is no difference.

49
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,280
We still get through.

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,800
But instead of repeating ourselves.

51
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,420
In case we have a culture group that we want to repeat it, we just provide one.

52
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,450
OK, so it is going to work like this.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,530
So this is the testing.

54
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,520
Let's go ahead and let's talk about the matching.

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,340
So I'm just going to copy it below and common these one out.

56
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:55,100
So now we are going to grab our sentence and we are going to say match match to match it to the regular

57
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,950
expression that we have created number 27.

58
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:05,250
And this is going to be this is not going to be the test result, this is going to be the match results,

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,250
let's save it.

60
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,660
And we get this now, you might ask, OK, why do we get, like, book, book?

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,150
And then one other book?

62
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,810
The reason for that is.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,470
Well, this should be marching well, there was I shouldn't have, like, copy pasted that I should

64
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,200
have written it.

65
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:29,980
I'm just going to paste this for you as a reference here that this is a shorthand is a shorthand way

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,910
for this is for repeating what is inside the parentheses.

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,820
So this book book is repeated by this and we have this as well.

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,970
So this parentheses is repeated once with this and then we have the parentheses themselves.

69
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,180
That's why we have another book in here.

70
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,320
So this is a reference for you.

71
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,490
So we have four capture groups.

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,940
We have talked about the testing and we have talked about the matching.

73
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,660
Now, what I am going to do is I'm going to give you another example.

74
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,740
So this is very, very clear.

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,250
So for that, I'm going to comment everything out and I'm going to provide some space here.

76
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,660
OK, and in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create some digits, so the digits are going

77
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,570
to be three, two, one, three, two, one, one, two, three.

78
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:29,280
So three occurrences of three digits, three digit numbers.

79
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,220
Right.

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,070
And now let's create our regular expression, which is twenty seven X.

81
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,590
So what do we want to do here?

82
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,430
We want to find out the same pattern.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,890
So for this pattern, how would we write a regular expression?

84
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:52,410
So we would write that we have a number in the beginning, a number in the beginning, and this is our

85
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,910
culture group inside this.

86
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,400
So we are going to grab all numbers.

87
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:04,140
Keep in mind, D is all digits or all numbers, zero or more occurrences of them, and then we are looking

88
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,880
for a space.

89
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,970
After that, we want to repeat this entire search and then we look for space and then we repeat this

90
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,900
entire search.

91
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,430
OK, and also we have numbers at the end as well.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,850
So we have numbers at the start.

93
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,180
We have numbers at the end.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,600
Only this regular expression is going to return.

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,900
True.

96
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,720
So let's first off, let's talk about the testing part.

97
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,590
So I'm just going to say testing.

98
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,940
And in the testing, I'm going to say let.

99
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:46,800
You know what, I'm just going to copy this from here, it's easier, so regular expression test, it

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:57,390
should be digits, digits and let's copy this, put it right here and oops, put it right here and commented

101
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,910
and and now we get false.

102
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,890
So we have regular expression test.

103
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,560
It is regular expression number 27 and we test the digits.

104
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:19,650
OK, so we have this we have space, we are repeated once and when we have space, we repeated it one

105
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,800
more time and then we have the dollar sign, which says that it is at the end.

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,790
And when I save it, we get a OK, maybe like because this is one, two, three.

107
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,980
We should and this is three to one and now we get two.

108
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,740
So it has to be the same thing.

109
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,520
So it has to be that's why because when we say repeated it, it should be the same thing.

110
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,160
This was a mistake and I'm sorry for that.

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,530
When we say repeat, it should be the same thing.

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,650
So this is like the short the short hand way we could go ahead with the long way as well.

113
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,290
So I'm just going to copy this.

114
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm going to grab this one and I'm going to basted like that.

115
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,050
So both of them is going to return.

116
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:09,180
True, because both of them are looking for a pattern of three digits, three digits, three numbers

117
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,250
that have three digits inside of them.

118
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,270
Now, why did we do the dollar sign at the end?

119
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,690
For example, if I remove the dollar sign, it should say true again.

120
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,170
But if I were to add like four or five secs, like six, five, four, sorry, we are going to get through

121
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,280
as well because we haven't specified what the end results should be.

122
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:37,980
So it is looking for three copies of the same number and after that it doesn't care what comes inside

123
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,669
this pattern.

124
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,320
But when we provide the dollar sign, we say that this pattern should be the starting thing and also

125
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,030
the ending thing.

126
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,700
And when I say it, we get false.

127
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,080
All right.

128
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,440
So this is going to be the testing part.

129
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,980
Let's go ahead and let's talk about the matching.

130
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,180
Matching, right, and for the matching.

131
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm just going to copy, you know what, I'm just going to write it.

132
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,420
So I'm going to say let Reg X match the result.

133
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,760
So we are going to grab our digits.

134
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,860
All right, so in the digits, what do we want to do?

135
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,990
We want to match it.

136
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,740
Match it with what with the regular expression number twenty seven, so a regular expression, number

137
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:33,580
27 and right after that we want to console logit, it is regular expression match result.

138
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,490
So let's come in this one out.

139
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,110
Let's save it.

140
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,150
We get that.

141
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,970
So why do we get three, three, two once and then we get three to one once more?

142
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,320
The reason for that is this.

143
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,120
This thing is going to run first, which is going to give us this.

144
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,840
And finally, we are going to run this parentheses one more time.

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
That's in another iteration.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,110
You can think of it like that.

147
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,580
That's not completely accurate, but you can think of it like that.

148
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,350
So you understand how it works.

149
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,010
And then this parentheses is going to run one more time.

150
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,670
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to give you another comment in here as well as a resource.

151
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,660
All right.

152
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,170
So this is going to be it for this lecture.

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,160
See you guys in the next one.
