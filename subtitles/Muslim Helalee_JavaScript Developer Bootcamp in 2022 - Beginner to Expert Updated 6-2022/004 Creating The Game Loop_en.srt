00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,600
Hi, everyone, in this nation working to create the game loop.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,980
All right, so I'm just going to create a comment here and I'm going to say the game loop, it's going

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,940
to be a bit different than the previous project that we had in the sense that we are going to use set

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,600
interval.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,480
Right.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,850
So I'm going to call this function run game.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,490
All right, now, inside this function, what I want to do first is I want to draw our ball so we can

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,010
see something on the canvas.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,780
So I'm going to say drawing the ball.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,260
Right.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,050
So we know that in order to draw a circle, we first off, we should say begin path.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,060
So begin path.

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:01:00,030
And right after that or before that first style doesn't matter where you provided canvas context, Phil

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,310
style should be orange and then canvas.

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,910
Context, dot ark.

16
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,200
Now, here is where things get interesting, so what do we have here?

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,330
Right, so we have our our horizontal position, we have our vertical position.

18
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,020
Right.

19
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,330
And we need to pass them right here.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,260
OK, so what are we going to do is I'm going to grab our horizontal position and then the vertical position,

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:45,160
then the radius starting angle and math dot pi times two ending angle.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,670
And finally, we are going to say canvass context, dot phil.

23
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,500
So now if I say we are not going to see anything on the screen.

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,800
Right.

25
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,450
The reason for that is we need to call this function.

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,400
So I'm going to say I'm going to come here and I'm going to say set interval and we are going to say

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,510
set interval.

28
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,190
Let's click on it.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,360
All right, so what do you want to do in here, so in here?

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,540
First off, we are going to put in the name of that function.

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,010
We are going to call that function.

32
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,190
How many times do we want to call it per second?

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,060
So 1000 milliseconds is one second.

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,840
We want to call it AFPs times per one second.

35
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,610
So it's going to call it 60 times for one second.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,210
And you can see it does it is being called.

37
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:39,220
But the thing is that all of these circles are being drawn on top of each other.

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,020
Right.

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,200
How do we know that?

40
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,320
So let's go ahead.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,690
Actually move the circle.

42
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,200
Right.

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:53,300
So what I'm going to do is we are going to sort of be able to move the circle is for us to do one thing,

44
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,830
actually two things.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,920
We need to change the position of the circle so we know that the position of the circle is in the middle

46
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,430
and let's change it.

47
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:01,870
All right.

48
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,810
And what is the value that we want to change that position by?

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,600
We want to change it by its velocity.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,450
So the velocity is speed plus direction.

51
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,180
And then we have our position, current position.

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,990
So current position, speed, plus the right direction.

53
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,590
The ball is going to go to the right speed, plus the other direction.

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,070
Ball is going to go to the to the top and you get the idea.

55
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:34,990
So what are we going to do as I'm going to be right here moving the ball from its current position.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Right.

57
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,380
So we are going to grab the XP and we want to add on to it.

58
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:48,140
We do not want to like let's say we do not want to clear the ball all together.

59
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,680
We just want to add on the velocity to it.

60
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,180
That's why we are going to say, plus, if you don't say plus is just going to move to that specific

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,700
position and then it is going to stop.

62
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,090
All right, so and we are going to do the same thing for the for the Y position as well, you're going

63
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,210
to add on to it the Y velocity.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,710
So let's save this.

65
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,810
Let's see what's happening.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,380
There we go.

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,870
Save it.

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,920
You can see that it happens to be in multiple directions.

69
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,089
Why is that?

70
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,290
It is because of our current situation that we have here.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:32,120
So if the coin toss returns something that is not too we are not going to do anything if it is to sorry

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,020
if if sorry if it if it returns something that equals to zero, then we are going to change the direction,

73
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,370
the velocity for the extraction.

74
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,770
If it doesn't we are not going to change it.

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,300
The same thing applies for the Y.

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,870
So each time I reload we are going to get because this is random, each time you reload it is going

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,280
to generate a random number and that's why we get different directions for this feat.

78
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:06,720
And what you might be asking, why is this being elongated, the reason for that is because we are not

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,660
clearing the canvas and we can see all the iterations of that.

80
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,580
Now, how can we see that better?

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,040
I showed you in the previous project, I'm still going to show you in this project as well.

82
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:27,330
So instead of Phil style, we are going to say stroke style instead of Phil, we are going to say stroke.

83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,650
Let's save it.

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,320
Let's come here.

85
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:30,980
There we go.

86
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:38,350
Now you can see the circles being drawn and because we are not clearing the canvas, we can see all

87
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,240
the previous iterations of the circle.

88
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm going to zoom out so you can really see it, see?

89
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,980
Circle is being drawn on top of each other, so that's not something that we want.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,860
So we need to clear the canvas.

91
00:05:51,780 --> 00:06:03,150
So clearing the canvas, so how can we clear so we're going to say canvas context that clear rucked.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:13,590
And zero position zero, so starting from the zero position in the X and Y, go all the way to the canvas

93
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,550
elements dot with and canvas elements dot height and clear everything.

94
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,000
So now there we go.

95
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,730
Our ball is finally moving.

96
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,900
We don't have any collision detection.

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
That's why it's moving off the screen.

98
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,250
So let's bring back our film style so we can actually see the ball moving.

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,650
All right, so let's save it.

100
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,220
See, now the ball is moving in different directions.

101
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:54,980
The velocity is also different, you can see velocity is higher, slower, higher, higher, slower.

102
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,940
So so the only thing left for us to do is to.

103
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,780
Detect the collision, and I'm not going to do that in this lecture.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,640
It's already been seven minutes.

105
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,020
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to postpone that to the next lecture and we are going to detect

106
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,880
some edges.

107
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,590
So see you guys in the next lecture.
