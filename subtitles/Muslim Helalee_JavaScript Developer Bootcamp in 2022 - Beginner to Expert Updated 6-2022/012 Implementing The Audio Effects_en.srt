00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,870
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,280
In this lecture, we will be implementing the sound effects.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,900
OK, so so far, we do have a working game in case you want to play.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,760
So it is completely playable on imagine every device available and you can go ahead and play it.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,090
And now what I would like to do here is I'm going to point you towards this folder.

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,990
So we do have a sound folder, brick paddle, power up and wall.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,230
And right after this video, we will be working with the power ups.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,200
All right.

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,900
So after the canvas, what I would like to do here is I'm going to create variables.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,720
So the first one is going to be audio brick.

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,950
So I'm going to say mudbrick.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,260
It is going to be new audio, new audio.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,580
And let's provide the path for that.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,410
So it is in the sounds folder.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,060
And from there it is going to be brick dot com for a let's copy this a few more times here.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,550
And so the first one is going to be the brick, the second one, and that's our paddle.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,600
And it is going to be the paddle dart.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,560
And for a.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,790
OK, right after that, we have the power up, power up, which we are going to implement.

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,580
So don't worry about it and it is going to be power up.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,960
It's add an O there and finally, we have the war.

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,560
And this is going to be one.

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,370
Now let's see where we should implement them, so we should implement them wherever we have hit those,

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,810
we had either the break, any break.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,350
So I'm just going to collapse this whatever we had a break or any, for example.

26
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,680
The wall or the paddle or when we eat any power up, so first things first whenever we serve the ball.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,340
I want that I want the sound to to play, all right, and that is going to be the panel sound.

28
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,250
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to the service function and right before returning something

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,850
and hear what I'm going to do is I'm going to say audio panel that play.

30
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,150
So let's save it.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,490
Let's come here.

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,340
So this is our game.

33
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,340
There we go.

34
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,640
So that audio is being played each time we serve the ball.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,980
There we go.

36
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,710
So the idea is being played.

37
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:53,090
Next stop, let's play the sound effects for the wall, and so where should we apply that?

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:01,800
So what I'm going to do is let's go to our updatable function, which I assume is down here.

39
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,540
So inside the updatable function.

40
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,530
What do we want to do here?

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,280
So whenever we hit a ball, sorry, we hit a wall, so this is where we are bouncing off the walls.

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,990
So this is if we had the left, right and top, we have to call the idea here as well.

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,310
So we are going to say audio wall.

44
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:34,540
Don't play, so this is going to play it for the left wall and this is going to play it for the right.

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,080
We need to play it for the top ball as well.

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,480
All right, so now let's save it.

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,350
Let's check it out.

48
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,390
There we go.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,120
So on the left, it does play right about the sorry and right.

50
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,050
What about the left?

51
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,370
And I assume it is going to play for the top as well.

52
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:08,580
OK, so next up, what I would like to do is, let's see, I want to apply this whenever it hits the

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,500
paddle as well.

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,280
So in here, when it hits the paddle, we are going to apply the paddles audio.

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,640
So where is it so bouncing of the paddle?

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,540
There we go.

57
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,589
Right here.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,720
We are going to say audio paddle.

59
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,160
Ops dot play, let's save it.

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,960
So apart from the bricks, it should play, it should work everywhere.

61
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,660
I'm just going to increase the idea.

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,900
And I'm sure you can hear that.

63
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,620
Perfect.

64
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,260
So it is working fine.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,690
Next stop, we need to implement that for our bricks as well.

66
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,620
All right, so we are going to go inside our update Brooks function, so I'm just going to close this

67
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:56,920
one.

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,060
And in here, let's see where we should play that.

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm going to play it right after we decrease the number of bricks.

70
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,390
And I'm going to say Ardeo Brick.

71
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,910
And itude, I did it again, fly when to calling the plane, called the plane with it.

72
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,920
There we go.

73
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,130
So we are done effectively with this idea.

74
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,930
I'm just going to play it one more time.

75
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,610
You know what?

76
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm going to go into this responsive and let's see if it plays here.

77
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,160
So when you when you tap it is going to play that and now it is playing it.

78
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,620
There we go.

79
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,140
Let's get a wall.

80
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,280
Oops.

81
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,270
Oh, there we go.

82
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,070
That is the wall.

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,150
So it is playing off all the sides.

84
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,780
It's really difficult with this mouse simulating the touch, OK?

85
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,600
That was very.

86
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:08,350
OK, so you saw how we played with the mobile phone and the speed was 300, the starting speed.

87
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,230
That is because the height is different, right, for the mobile phone.

88
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,560
So we are basically in the touch simulation.

89
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,150
We are basically on a different device.

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,200
That's why it is 300.

91
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,600
But for browser, I assume that for all of my browser it is going to be three three seven.

92
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,440
So that's it for this lecture.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,000
In the next lecture, we are going to start creating the power ups and we will go through them.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,120
Hopefully they are going to take not that many lectures and there they are going to be really, really

95
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,440
fun.

96
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,220
So see you guys then.
