00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,050
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,030
In this next year, we are going to make our UI functional.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,350
All right, so what do I mean by that, whenever I click this, we should get some rate, right?

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,680
So what are we going to do is I'm going to come on top.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,980
And let's see what it is that we want to grab, so in here, inside the inputs, we have an input type

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:33,350
of front currency, which we need to currency, which we need, and exchange amount which we require.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,060
And but so basically, we are going to grab from currency input to currency input exchange amount and

8
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,240
get right between the scrub them.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,010
So I'm going to say consed from currency input and document.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,700
You know what, I'm going to save you some time and I'm going to just copy paste this.

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,700
It's basically those inputs.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,800
We have selected them by their class names.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,570
Nothing special here.

14
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,210
Now where is going to be the event.

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,280
The event is going to be on the button.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,240
When the button is clicked, then that should happen.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,000
All right, Wendy Button is clicked.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,130
All right.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,470
So let's come here.

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,350
So I'm going to say get right between dot and event listener.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,080
And now you can see that one part of this entire scenario is done that is getting the data and getting

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,040
the data or retrieving the data and now converting it into a meaningful form is remaining.

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,210
That's what we are doing here, in case you're wondering.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,820
And one listener, we are going to listen for a click and then we are going to run a function and let's

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,300
grab the event object and now let's just save it.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,020
And now let's come here.

27
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,490
You can see that whenever I click, you can see the page reloads.

28
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,330
Take a look at this.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,280
You can see that the page reloads and this is the default behavior.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,180
Either you click or you hit enter in here.

31
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,020
No, it doesn't.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,630
So if I do hit enter, you can see that the the event is going to submit.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,150
So we are going to say idot prevent default behavior.

34
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,540
We don't want to submit.

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,200
We want to do something else now.

36
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,750
Now, what do we want to do?

37
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,220
We want to grab the value from this currency and put the value from this or the value of this currency

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,790
and put the value of this currency input and the exchange amount so we can understand what is what and

39
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,660
we can convert it.

40
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:51,910
So to be able to do that, as I'm going to say consed from currency value, I'm going to call it from

41
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,000
currency value.

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,610
And what is this?

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,880
It is going to be our foreign currency input dout value.

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:02,920
All right.

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,110
So let's copy it two more times.

46
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:13,090
So this is going to be two currency value, two currency input value, and then we have our exchange

47
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,720
amount.

48
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:22,840
Exchange amount value, so let's copy that exchange and mount.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,530
So it is exchange amount, there is no input there, I'm just going to add an input here as well, input

50
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,400
and now it is here.

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,510
So now I'm going to very quickly cancel logit.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm going to say from currency value to currency value exchange amount.

53
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,340
Exchange amount.

54
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,290
Exchange amount via, so let's save it.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:02,990
So now if I write a friend here, right, USD here and write 1000 and Kaleck, we get all that perfect.

56
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,140
So what do we want to do with this data?

57
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:14,740
We want to grab this value and put it here, and then we want to grab this value to currency, put it

58
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,870
here and then we want to grab the input amount and put it right here.

59
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,790
That said, that's basically what we want to do.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,590
So in order to do that, shouldn't we I mean, shouldn't we copy all that and remove this and paste

61
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,070
it here?

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:40,780
So instead of hard coding C++, what we can do is from currency value, from currency value is going

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,550
to be this one.

64
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,380
This is going to be two currency value.

65
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,470
And what does this amount amount is going to be exchange amount value.

66
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,170
So let's put it here.

67
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:50,970
All right.

68
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,150
So now this is going to be the same.

69
00:04:53,170 --> 00:05:02,590
So if I save it, keep in mind, if I save it and if I come here and if I say if an USD 1000 and click,

70
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,740
we get the same result.

71
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,380
So now the thing the only thing remaining is just get this result and put it inside the UI.

72
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,470
I mean, how difficult could that be?

73
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,780
It's in fact, very, very, very simple, so inside here, we are returning this council log, but

74
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't want to return it.

75
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,980
I want to say document dot.

76
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,710
Query selector what?

77
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,480
What is the element that I want to grab?

78
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,770
I want to grab this element.

79
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,920
So let's grab the class, because we are going to change the entire text of that element document that

80
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,010
query selector.

81
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,460
This is going to be the class dot in our text and our T 60.

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,200
What is the inner text.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,050
The inner text is going to be our exchange result.

84
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,110
It's copy.

85
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,290
Let's put it right here and now.

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:06:01,200
Let's check if it works, we get a if and USD, we get 1000 and click, we get that.

87
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,740
Now the thing with this is that it's not going to go away.

88
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,840
I want it to go.

89
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,240
I want it to go away after exactly like maybe five seconds.

90
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,870
So to set time out.

91
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,940
And I'm going to provide an arrow function here and I'm going to say location.

92
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,290
Now, when you say location to reload, it is going to reload the entire page.

93
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:32,570
OK, it's it's ironic that within our asynchronous function we are reloading the page.

94
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,650
I mean, if you get that, it's it's kind of a joke, right?

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,070
Like a retard joke.

96
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,300
But this is a programming.

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,250
Do we reload the function?

98
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,320
We reload the page inside our asynchronous function.

99
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,260
That's ironic.

100
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,350
OK, so what is the time I could put it to, for example, six seconds.

101
00:06:51,860 --> 00:07:04,520
So now if I do offend USD 1000, one, two, three, four, five, six perfect's.

102
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,960
I'm also a clock, right, so now we are done with this part.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Now the two major parts which are remaining is one, we need to make sure that whenever the input is

104
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,800
empty and we do something, we shouldn't get this error.

105
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,580
Not a no.

106
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,940
See, this is printed to this UI.

107
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,960
This is not something that we want to print.

108
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,180
So what I'm going to do here is we are going to create a basic F check.

109
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:49,390
We are going to check if if from currency value is empty or from or to currency value is empty or or

110
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,740
this is logical or operator or exchange amount value is empty.

111
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,560
Then do what?

112
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,900
Then go ahead and cancel log.

113
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,750
Error in caps alse.

114
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,480
And the aspart.

115
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,940
Come on, buddy, in the aspart, we want to run this thing.

116
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,500
So where is where is this going to end here?

117
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,800
The dot then is going to end right here.

118
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,910
So let's cut it.

119
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,260
Let's put it right here.

120
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,840
Save it.

121
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,660
So now if I click ever if I say Afan, let's remove this.

122
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,510
And if I click, we get error again.

123
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,400
If I do USD and remove this click, we get another error.

124
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,140
And now if I do 1000, we are not going to get any error and it should go after six seconds.

125
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:44,940
Hmm.

126
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,490
All right, so this is done as well, we have checked that, but the thing is, we don't want to log

127
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,890
this error to the console.

128
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,350
We want to show when the input is empty.

129
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,580
We want to show this stuff.

130
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,770
So instead of this, I'm going to call in function.

131
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,410
I'm going to say input, input, error.

132
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:19,020
And this input error, as is, has the responsibility to show this right now, that this is going to

133
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,720
be an input when or when one of these threes is empty, we certainly have an input error.

134
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,580
But there was another kind of error as well, which we threw right here, and that was the invalid code

135
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,860
error.

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,360
So instead of doing this, I'm going to say I'm going to say throw new year.

137
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,570
So throw new error.

138
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:51,100
And inside this error, what I'm going to do, I'm going to call the invalid code function, I'm going

139
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,450
to call the invalid.

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,720
Now, we are yet to create these functions.

141
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,380
We need to create the input error and the invalid code.

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,840
Now, we have created this error here.

143
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,540
How can we catch this error?

144
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,220
We should catch it right here.

145
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,520
So after the dot, then we know how we can catch it.

146
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,950
So if I do it, if I save it, nothing is going.

147
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,440
We will see some.

148
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,970
If I do this, we see error because input, error, they're not defined.

149
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,010
We are going to define them.

150
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,100
Don't worry about that.

151
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,470
We are going to catch the error here.

152
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,280
So to to catch the error, I'm not going to do anything.

153
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm just going to call this function.

154
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,800
Right.

155
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,330
So I'm going to say invalid.

156
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,790
Invalid code function.

157
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,070
Now, keep in mind, we don't have two errors, we have three errors.

158
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,030
One error is the input error rate, which actually has three types.

159
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,800
If this is empty, if this is empty, if this is empty, which you have, which actually has three types,

160
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,270
I'm not talking about that.

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,270
We have an input error, but we have two different kinds of invalid code.

162
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,900
Why are two different kinds just go away?

163
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,940
The first one is whenever the from currency code is incorrect.

164
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,590
The second one is whenever the two currency code is incorrect.

165
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,850
So we actually we are throwing three errors.

166
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,290
So this is catching one error.

167
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,220
So let's save it.

168
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,430
Why didn't it come down?

169
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,000
Should have come down here.

170
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:33,700
Oh, I added it to the set time out, I should add it to here and now it's in the correct place.

171
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,060
So when then is done and then we add that catch.

172
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:45,640
So this is going to throw the invalid error whenever the first input is incorrect, this is going to

173
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,900
throw the invalid error.

174
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,870
When the second input is incorrect, this is going to throw an error when either of the inputs is empty.

175
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,090
So we are going to simulate these errors in our next selection.

176
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,230
See you guys then.
