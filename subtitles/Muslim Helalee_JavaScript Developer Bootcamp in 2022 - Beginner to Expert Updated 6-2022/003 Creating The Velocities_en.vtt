00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.790
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.110
In this next year, we will be finding velocities for the extraction and the Y direction.

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.450
All right, so before actually creating this scam, we need to have some variables and the first one,

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.300
I'm just going to say if B.S. frames per second now, why do we need offices?

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:31.180
Because we I think it was actually I don't remember which I think it was the moving star project where

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.910
I told you that there are two ways of creating that game loop.

7
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.200
One way was the method of set animation frame.

8
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.610
So request animation frame.

9
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.930
And the second one was set interval in this structure.

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.150
What I want to talk about is I want to grab the center and set interval function or method, and through

11
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.910
that I want to create the game.

12
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.860
So, you know both of these cases.

13
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.410
All right.

14
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:06.500
So the radius of the ball let's create that is going to be 50 the same the same radius that we had before.

15
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.290
Now, I'm going to initially declared these, but not initialize them the positions.

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.210
So I'm going to say X and Y P, right.

17
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.240
And I'm also going to say let now the X velocity.

18
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.870
I'm just going to say X capital V and the Y velocity.

19
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.350
I'm going to say Y Capital V instead of writing that horizontal velocity, which is going to end up

20
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.740
with like we're going to end up with a lot of typos and errors.

21
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.860
This is a better representation of that.

22
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.150
Now, just going over the velocity one more time now, speed that we talked about in a previous chapter

23
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.490
is how fast something moves.

24
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.200
We don't care about the direction.

25
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.980
Right.

26
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.670
But velocity is that speed plus a direction.

27
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.670
All right.

28
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:07.270
And what we want in here is we want to grab our velocities in pixels per frame so we know that we have

29
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.360
60 frames in one second.

30
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.760
How many pixels do we have in that one frame of one second?

31
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.060
So you can see that how how detailed this process is.

32
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:30.550
So eventually we are going to convert our X and Y V or velocities to two pixels per frame rather than

33
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.980
pixels per second.

34
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.660
Right.

35
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.650
And another common convention for velocity.

36
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.590
It's and it is actually mathematically correct is DKS for the X velocity and DUI for the Y velocity.

37
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.280
But I'm just going to stick to this convention.

38
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.850
All right.

39
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:57.430
So now what I want to do here is I'm going to grab our X coordinate and I'm going to say, OK, so what

40
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.280
is the X coordinate of this ball?

41
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.980
I'm going to specify that as a canvas element.

42
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.990
So let's say, OK, I should open this up with live server.

43
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.620
OK, come on, buddy, so we can see that we don't have a ball, but we have our canvas.

44
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.420
Now, if I want to put the ball right in the middle of the canvas vertically and horizontally, what

45
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.470
is this point now?

46
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:32.690
This point is canvas element that with so I'm going to say canvas element dot with now canvas element

47
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.010
dot with at this point is zero at this point.

48
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.030
We have canvas Arminda with what is the between of them is canvas element.

49
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.640
Dudd width divided by two is going to give us the center point right there.

50
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.830
So I'm just going to divide it by two.

51
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.010
The same thing we are going to do for the Y position.

52
00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:00.050
We are going to say that canvas element does height divided by two is going to give us the middle point

53
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.050
in the vertical direction midpoint.

54
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.030
So we have specified the height, the position and the Y position for our ball.

55
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.210
And from this we can grab the velocities.

56
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.560
All right.

57
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.110
So what what I what I'm going to do is actually velocity has nothing to do with this.

58
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.600
We are just going to randomly specify that.

59
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.860
So I'm going to say X V, which is the horizontal velocity equals mass.

60
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.560
I just want to generate a random velocity.

61
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.800
One of the features of this game is whenever you reload the velocity, the direction that the ball moves

62
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.030
towards two is going to change as well as the velocity.

63
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.320
So now you can see the ball is faster here.

64
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.490
The ball is, I think, the same the same speed thing, the same, the same.

65
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.700
Now here it is obvious that it is slower, right?

66
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.960
Faster, faster, faster, fast, slow.

67
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.570
And then we get fast, fast, fast, slow again.

68
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.630
So each time the page reloads, we are going to have a random velocity for X and a random velocity for

69
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.930
a Y.

70
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.020
So now here is where you specify the velocity.

71
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.760
Now the velocity for this ball is two or one plus ninety nine.

72
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.550
So if I put it to five o one plus ninety nine for X and Y and if I said what you can see that the ball

73
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.640
is moving faster.

74
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.760
So if you want to move faster, you just go ahead and give it higher numbers.

75
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.040
I'm going to stick to two or one plus 99.

76
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.850
And what does this mean?

77
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.260
So the math that random is going to either give us zero or one or values between that.

78
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.220
We don't care about the values between that, because what we are going to get, what we are going to

79
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.570
oops, where we are going to do here is we are going to lower this value.

80
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.670
So it doesn't really matter whether we get zero point one zero point two, because we are going to FLOHR

81
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.620
That right?

82
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:17.040
It means that we are going to rounded off a rounded up to the next integer to the nearest integer.

83
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.310
So if math are random, gives us zero point for Mark, that floor is going to give us zero.

84
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.110
OK, if math are random, gives us, for example, one math, the floor is not going to do anything.

85
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.760
So if so, the outcome of math that random is going to be either zero or one.

86
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.200
If it is one one times two or one, we are going to get to a one two one plus 999.

87
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.450
We are going to get 300.

88
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.360
So the speed is so the velocity is going to be 300 for the X direction.

89
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.790
And if the other random is zero zero times two one zero and we are going to get 99, the same thing

90
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.080
we want to do for the Y velocity as well.

91
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:07.350
I don't want to declare them to the same thing, but they could be the same if randomly they are the

92
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.640
same.

93
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:16.920
Right now what what this gives us is going to be pixels per second, but we want pixels per frame,

94
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.150
not per second.

95
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.030
We have frames per second.

96
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.760
So how many pixels are in one frame?

97
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.770
We know there are 60 frames in one second, but how many pixels are in one frame?

98
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.960
So for that, we just divided by our AFPs.

99
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.720
Uh, F.P., yes.

100
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.400
And this one is divided by AFPs as well.

101
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:46.530
So now the the outcome of this velocity and this velocity is going to be pixels per frame.

102
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:56.560
So we are either going to have like two like 300 pixels per frame and 60 frames per one second, which

103
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.560
is going to be, I think, 18000.

104
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.040
Or 1800, I think it's 800, so let's grab the calculator.

105
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.520
So 60 multiplied by 300.

106
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.830
Yeah, 18000.

107
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.680
I was correct.

108
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:17.620
So we are either going to have 18000 or 99 times 30, 60, whatever the result of that is.

109
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.970
So we have successfully achieved the X velocity and the velocity.

110
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.830
We have randomized it in our games.

111
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.790
We are going to come up with a better way of actually doing this.

112
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:37.580
Now, what I want to do is I want to go back to these Random Stars project where we had a sort of coin

113
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:46.310
toss situation where if the if you guys remember the random sine function, which is the four for which

114
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:54.440
we had, if the outcome of the math, the random is equal to or above zero point five, we would have

115
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.230
returned one or a positive sign.

116
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.570
And if it was less than zero point five, we would have returned in negative side.

117
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.680
So we basically want to grab a sign from that.

118
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.860
And either that sign is positive or negative randomly, whatever the random, whatever randomly it is.

119
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.240
So in this case, we also have a coin.

120
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.300
It's called a coin toss situation in game development in JavaScript.

121
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.250
I'm not sure about the other engines, but in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this differently.

122
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:34.040
So we have a math done at random which is going to generate random numbers.

123
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.820
But I want random whole numbers, so I'm just going to multiply it by two.

124
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.600
But this is not going to give me how it's going to give me two point one something or two point to something.

125
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.250
But I want to floor this as well.

126
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:56.220
So it gives me like whole and whole integers of floor, just going to say math dot floor and then.

127
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:04.150
Now if this value if this value that comes out of that equals zero, what do I want to do?

128
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.260
I want to grab the X velocity and I want to change it to the other direction.

129
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:16.940
So if the X velocity was positive, it means that the the ball is moving to the right.

130
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.130
I want to move it to the left central.

131
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.250
And the same thing goes for the y axis, for the y directions velocity.

132
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.350
I'm just going to grab this stuff and I'm going to convert it to why they could be the same randomly.

133
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.060
But other than that, I do not want a hard code them to be the same.

134
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.300
So that's set for this lecture in the next lecture.

135
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.060
We're going to create the game loop.

136
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:50.490
And also if if there was some time, we are going to go over the collision detection for this particular

137
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.570
project as well.

138
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.610
See you guys in the next one.
