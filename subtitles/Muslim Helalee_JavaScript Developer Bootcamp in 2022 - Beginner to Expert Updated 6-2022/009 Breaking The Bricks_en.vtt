00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.939
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to update the bricks when the ball hits them.

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.040
All right, so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to go to our game loop.

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.620
And in here, I'm going to create an update bricks function, I'm going to call and update Brick's function,

4
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.450
which is responsible for removing the bricks whenever the ball hits them.

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.580
All right.

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.560
And we are going to create that.

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.980
Where is our update panel?

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.030
So let me just collapse this one.

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.390
And this is our update pottle function and right on top of that in here.

10
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.360
I'm just going to copy that comment and put it there, and I'm going to call it out of date Breck's,

11
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.020
so we have a function that is going to be update Breck's Perfect.

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.570
So first off, we are going to check for Ball Colation.

13
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.180
Collusion.

14
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:13.990
All right, so we are going to say for let I call zero and then I is going to be less than the bricks,

15
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.010
the length.

16
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.460
So Breck's.

17
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.560
Dart length.

18
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.430
Breaks the length, all right, and I we are going to incremented by one, so this is going to loop

19
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.970
over the breaks length and then we are going to create another for loop that is going to loop over the

20
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.460
bricks columns.

21
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.620
So we are going to sell a J equal to zero and J is going to be less than the brick columns that we have

22
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.370
and J is going to incremented by one each time.

23
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.050
So J.

24
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.970
Plus plus.

25
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.130
All right.

26
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.390
So what it is that we want to do here, so we want to set the ball to the edge of the brick whenever

27
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.100
it hits that we want to find that position.

28
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:16.090
So in here we are going to say f the balls y velocity is less than zero.

29
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.090
It means that it is traveling upwards.

30
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.550
Right.

31
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.090
So I'm just going to right in here upwards.

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:34.160
We want to grab the balls y position and we are going to set it to the bricks I and then passing J dot

33
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.550
bottom plus the balls.

34
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.250
Half of the balls height half of.

35
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.640
The ball's it perfect and so this is going to be the upwards, then we will have the down words we need

36
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.390
to take take that into account as well.

37
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.280
So I'm just going to you know what?

38
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.590
I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say downwards.

39
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.880
So that is going to be alse within this hour.

40
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.090
We are going to grab the ball as y position and we are going to set it to basically something like this.

41
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.160
But we are going to say the top minus the balls, half of the balls height, right.

42
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.720
And what I would like to do next is I would like to grab each of the breaks that the ball is going to

43
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.140
hit.

44
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.810
So for that, we are going to say bricks I.

45
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.530
J.

46
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.400
This is going to give us a single brick and we are going to set it to No.

47
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.590
All right, and I think that is it.

48
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.980
I think so, and then I'm going we are going to say break now.

49
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.860
I'm going to say break outr, because whenever this all of this happens, we want to break out of the

50
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.480
not only this for loop, but also the parents for a loop, which is this one.

51
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.300
So this is something that we call a label.

52
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.130
So whenever you label it is going to break out of that as well.

53
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:12.070
So let's say that let's come here and tiebreaks is null and let's see, it is three sixty nine.

54
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:28.080
OK, so if I come here, you can see that our ball is gone, so 369 dot tops Brake's IJA, the top minus

55
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.390
that update bricks, we have also called it, right.

56
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.690
Let's go ahead and let's check out what actually the problem is.

57
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.310
I'm just going to enlarge increase this just for if I can.

58
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.630
It is raining, so that's why I cannot do it.

59
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.290
You can see that it is it is basically I can do anything with that.

60
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.240
So there we go.

61
00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.890
And I just want to take a look at one of them to see what the problem is so it says cannot access property

62
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.050
top of the null, even though we have specified that.

63
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.550
We know that.

64
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.710
The bricks, they have a top and they have a bottom, right?

65
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.500
So whenever the ball speed is less than zero, we will add that to it.

66
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.460
Oh, we need to check for another as well.

67
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.680
So we need to check if the ball actually intersects with that brick.

68
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:37.870
So we are going to say if the brick, whichever brick it is that the ball headset J is not actually,

69
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.280
no.

70
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.130
It means that it is not actually like absent.

71
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.120
If it if there isn't any brick, how can we break a brick.

72
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.490
So that's what we are looking for here.

73
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.740
And then we are going to call in the bricks function, the bricks array passant I enjoy for each individual

74
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.680
brick and in here we are going to call in and intersect method which we are going to create.

75
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.380
Don't worry about it, and then everything else is going to go within their so right.

76
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.680
So let me put all of that there.

77
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.050
Let's save it.

78
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.730
So now let's go ahead and let's create this intersect function.

79
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:30.170
So I'm going to go down to the to this breaks, I'm just going to come in these ones in and below here,

80
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.380
I'm going to say this is going to be our Intersect function.

81
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.100
So I'm going to say this intersect and it is going to be a expression.

82
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.100
So what do we want to do here now, let's say we are going to define for position for four of the sides

83
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.610
of the ball, so we are going to say it ball bottom.

84
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.070
The ball bottom is going to be the balls y position, plus half of the balls height.

85
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.760
So half of the balls height.

86
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.050
Then we are going to sell that ball left.

87
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.160
It is going to be devil's exposition, minus half of the balls with.

88
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.240
Perfect, then we are going to specify the balls, right?

89
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.970
And that is going to be devil's exposition plus half of the balls with.

90
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:40.480
Perfect, and then we are going to specify the balls top position, which is going to be the balls y

91
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.580
position, minus half of the balls height times zero point five.

92
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.940
And we want this function to return.

93
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.410
What it should return.

94
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.730
It is going to return.

95
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.700
All right.

96
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.090
So it is going to turn this left.

97
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:03.090
So the left side of the break should be less than the right side of the ball.

98
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.930
So ball.

99
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.650
Right.

100
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.010
Perfect.

101
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.090
And.

102
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.300
The balls left side.

103
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:21.800
Should be less than the bricks, the bricks right side, so this then this dust, right, and are getting

104
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.170
to the bottom side of the brick.

105
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.960
So Brick, this stuff bottom should be larger than the top side of the wall.

106
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.440
And these are basically y coordinates and coordinates.

107
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.770
And finally, we are going to say that the bottom part of the ball.

108
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:52.700
Should be bigger than the top part of the break, we just wanted to return this, so we have used this.

109
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.690
This should be Capital T. So we have used all of this in here.

110
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.470
Right.

111
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:06.900
And the next logical step for us is going to be I'm going to head up to our Breck's, where we draw

112
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.240
them, where we drew them.

113
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.980
So I'm going to head up there.

114
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.220
Where is our draw Breck's function?

115
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.890
There we go.

116
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:20.640
And in here before actually running that, I want to see that if a brick is not, we do not want to

117
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.410
run anything.

118
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:27.630
So if the BRAC is null, we do not want to druidry.

119
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.500
So we are just going to continue to the next iteration.

120
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.930
So I would like to do that here as well and.

121
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:45.260
Ah, right, so I think we are ready to test this, so let's come here and I'm just going to go ahead

122
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.280
and decrease this to maybe right here.

123
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.100
So if I hit the ball, it should break some bricks.

124
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.660
Well, why is it doing that?

125
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.220
It should when it breaks it, it should bounce off of it.

126
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.860
But you can see that it is not bouncing off of that.

127
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:07.970
So I think there is something missing here, so that's what I'm going to do, is I'm going to go to

128
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:18.250
our break sort of update bricks, and when it removes or destroys a brick, we want to grab the bones.

129
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.580
Why velocity and change its direction.

130
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.340
So minus by balls, that yv.

131
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.380
So now let's save it.

132
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.190
That's come here.

133
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.120
There we go.

134
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.950
So it creates I'm just going to go for like a few seconds, maybe like 30 seconds, I'm going to hit

135
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.110
I'm going to continue to break like a least a couple of rows.

136
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.320
The reason for that is I want to check if there are any bugs or something.

137
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.270
But this is this could take some time.

138
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.010
So what if we go ahead and if we change the ball speed to point seven, which should be really fast.

139
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.650
There we go.

140
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.630
Now, I hope I can keep up.

141
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.310
I just want to check if there are any issues or any bugs.

142
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:10.660
If we go to you can see that we have different spins for the ball, even though we we are yet to actually

143
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:16.450
create that, we have a minimum bounce angle, but we need to make it like really official.

144
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:23.130
Create a method for that, and I have commented it out, it is inside your code, but it is commented

145
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.970
out and maybe we are going to do that next.

146
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.900
So let's just try to destroy some bricks.

147
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:40.210
Perfect, so so far, row one and row two, level one and level two, they were perfectly fine.

148
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:48.780
I'm just going to keep on, like for a few more rose or a few more times, I'm just going to go ahead

149
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.070
and.

150
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:58.500
And it is a good it is a good idea to always test your code for all the possible outcomes, because

151
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:05.930
you need to know what the how exactly your game or your application is going to react in different circumstances.

152
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:13.470
So there is no surprises when when that application is ready for production, you need to test it for

153
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.700
all the possibilities and all the bugs that it might have.

154
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.750
OK, so it seems to be working perfectly fine.

155
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.560
There we go.

156
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.400
There it is.

157
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.370
So go up.

158
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.010
So that was a good run.

159
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:37.050
So if I can get it up there on top of those reds, then that is going to break all of them.

160
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.950
But this is random, so it's not really in my control.

161
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.980
I cannot control it.

162
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.280
If it did it on its own, then then that's good.

163
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.610
Otherwise, I'm not sure if I can get it up there.

164
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.520
Because that the bossman is random.

165
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:04.120
So you can see that I think we are we can safely say that it is working fine.

166
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.340
And there shouldn't be any issues here, so let me just.

167
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.590
Oh, there we go, huh?

168
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.460
There we go.

169
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.080
No, it didn't win there anyways.

170
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.690
I think the issue is the issue is solved.

171
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.790
And what was the speed?

172
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.240
It was four or five.

173
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.150
I'm just going to set it to that.

174
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.150
And.

175
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:40.440
All right, so what I would like to do is now I want to take care of that spin that we have for a revolt,

176
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.160
right.

177
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:46.600
So first off, what I would like to do is I want to go to the ball function, so let's clops this one.

178
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.650
So the navigation is going to be easier for us and.

179
00:13:53.870 --> 00:14:03.590
OK, so let's come down its clops this one, and let's update bricks, so you should go to our update

180
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.460
ball function.

181
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.850
And from here, I'm just going to comment in all this.

182
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.940
So we have a spin.

183
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:20.240
Whenever whenever the ball is less than the wall, whenever the ball is moving left, when the ball

184
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.900
is moving right, or when the ball is moving towards the top.

185
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.460
And then let's see if we have any any else in here.

186
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.430
So this is going to be the top.

187
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.210
No, we don't have any other spin ball here other than I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add a

188
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:49.380
spin ball to if balls position is we want to we want it to be whenever it bounces off the paddle, we

189
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.150
want that spin ball as well.

190
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.370
We want the ball to spin.

191
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.000
So I'm going to call that function here as well and.

192
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.870
I think we are going to be we are done here, so why don't we have to do as the next thing that I would

193
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.780
like to create is going to be our spinnable function.

194
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.000
So where is our said dimensions to right beneath there?

195
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.790
I would like to create that function here.

196
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.090
And this is called spin ball.

197
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.270
And basically what it does is whenever the ball hits any surface, be that the paddle, the wall or

198
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.360
the brick, it should spin at a certain angle.

199
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.330
Right.

200
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.680
So let us first off create our function.

201
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:43.600
All right, and we're going to sell it upwards, it's going to be equal to whenever the buys started,

202
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:49.090
the bulls, why velocity is less than zero.

203
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.630
It means that the ball is traveling, traveling upwards.

204
00:15:52.810 --> 00:16:01.870
And what I would like to do here is if I come to my updatable function, we have a angle and angle that

205
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:08.080
that is going to grab the negative y velocity and the balls, what x velocity.

206
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.650
And we it is going to give us the exposition.

207
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:19.770
Then we have our angle, which is going to be math at random times, math that pi divided by two minus

208
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.220
all that multiplied by the ball spin.

209
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:29.700
So what I would like to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to cut these from here because we

210
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.900
have a spin ball.

211
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.120
So we we really do not need that.

212
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:39.510
I'm just going to I'm going to cut them with this with their comments.

213
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.200
So I'm going to paste them right here.

214
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.310
I'm going to save it.

215
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:53.520
And because we won the spin ball to actually work whenever we hit any brick, we are going to go into

216
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.160
our I'm just going to copy that function call inside our update bricks in here.

217
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.020
I'm going to be calling the spin ball function as well.

218
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.220
So we just called it there.

219
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:11.940
And what this is going to do as this is going to be responsible, this function for keeping the angle

220
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.380
between two limits.

221
00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:14.270
Right.

222
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.829
So for Ed to do that is.

223
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:24.640
We are going to we did something like this, if you remember, and that was inside our Bowlsby, we

224
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:30.380
were keeping the angle, the angle between two elements and all that.

225
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.910
We did all of this.

226
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.430
But now all of this has to be done inside our spin ball.

227
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.140
So I'm just going to grab everything.

228
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.000
I'm going to cut it from here and I'm going to come to our spin ball function.

229
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:51.790
And down below, I'm going to paste everything and I'm going to save it, so they rearrange themselves,

230
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:52.840
right.

231
00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:01.360
And we have I just want to go to top and see we do have our minimum bounce and go and I'm going to bring

232
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.900
it down.

233
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.040
Right.

234
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.720
And this is going to be 30.

235
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.820
So this is going to be the minimum bounce angle from the horizontal in degrees.

236
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.070
Right.

237
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.800
So.

238
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:19.110
The next thing that I would like to do, as I would like to modify this statement that we have here

239
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:25.590
and what I want to do is I want to create an upward variable rate, which we have done here.

240
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.600
And after that that we have created, I want to use it inside an if statement.

241
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:31.350
Right.

242
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.960
And the if statement.

243
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.330
Now, you can see that this is almost hardcoded.

244
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.940
I do not want a hard code this because we do have a minimum bounce angle as well.

245
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:42.690
Right.

246
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.680
And where is our let me just search for it.

247
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.540
So it is in bounds angle.

248
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.150
There it is.

249
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.540
So inside our serve ball we have our minimum bounce angle.

250
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200
And here as well.

251
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:05.800
So what we are going to do is we are going to use the minimum bounce angle from here inside our spin

252
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.650
ball function.

253
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.950
So where is the ball function?

254
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:16.210
OK, that as the apply speed, this is disserve ball, this is the spin ball, and at the end I'm just

255
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.770
going to go ahead and I'm going to call the appli ball speed and I'm going to pass and the angle.

256
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.150
And you can see that the serve the ball speed is called here as well.

257
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.200
And the angle is passed as well here.

258
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:34.930
So what I what I would like to do is let's come into this spin ball and I'm going to comment everything

259
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:35.350
out.

260
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.930
I could delete it.

261
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.060
So I think that is better.

262
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.140
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to delete everything and I'm going to say let the minimum

263
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:49.290
bounce angle be equal to the minimum bounce angle that we have.

264
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.340
Minimum bounce.

265
00:19:53.630 --> 00:20:02.120
Minimum bounce angle that we have divided by 180 degrees and then multiply by.

266
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.710
Multiply it by the math, that pie to get radiance, all right, and then we are going to say if if

267
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.410
the if the ball is moving upwards.

268
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.370
All right, what do we want to do?

269
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:28.500
We want to check for if the angle is less than the minimum bounce angle, so if the angle is less than

270
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.110
the minimum bounce angle.

271
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:38.490
So basically we want to check if the angle is less than the minimum single, it means that it is less

272
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.230
than 30.

273
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.770
We want to keep it at 30 if it is greater than minimum bounce angle.

274
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.740
We want to make sure it is not greater than 150.

275
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:55.440
So we're going to grab the angle and we are going to set it to minimum bounce angle and al-Assaf.

276
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:05.810
According going to Angle, if angle is greater than the math dot pi, which is going to give us one

277
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:12.170
hundred and eighty minus minimum, minimum balance angle, which is going to be 30, we want to keep

278
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.970
the angle at that, at that limit, which is going to be 150.

279
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:28.410
And for our final condition, we are going to say else, if angle if angle is greater than negative,

280
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:35.170
oops, else not in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another if statement and I'm going

281
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:41.110
to say if angle is greater than the negative minimum bounce angle.

282
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:50.310
We want to keep the angle, and that's how basically it is going to be this right here, just swap it

283
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.970
with a with inequality and then we're going to say Ancef.

284
00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:03.060
Why do I keep doing that, al-Assaf the angle we need to account for the negative angles as well matha

285
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.650
dot pi.

286
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.600
Now that is mine.

287
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.220
So this is going to be plus minimum bounce angle.

288
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.200
Then what do we want to do?

289
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.890
We want to do this, we want to keep it at that 150 limit.

290
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:22.040
Be that positive 150 or negative 150.

291
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.080
Yeah, save it.

292
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:30.870
So I'm going to, I'm going to keep playing so you can see that we have our minimum.

293
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.760
Oops, I lost it there.

294
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:41.880
So you can see that we have our angle, oops, oh, that was not something you can see it is not coming

295
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.330
down.

296
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:43.940
It should come down.

297
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.760
Now, it came down that was something bizarre.

298
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.450
So what is the problem here?

299
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:55.150
It says reference error angle is not defined at 360.

300
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.510
So if we go to 360.

301
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:08.070
Angle is not defined here and OK, so let me remove this from here.

302
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.010
OK, so let's check it one more time.

303
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.760
Let's see.

304
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:15.760
Mm hmm.

305
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:21.720
So it seems to be bouncing back a lot so you can see so there we go.

306
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.650
And there is still something missing here.

307
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:32.030
When it hits the the the wall, it should go into in the negative direction.

308
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.950
And the angle is it's it's very, very big.

309
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.390
It is not is not what we want here.

310
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:54.260
I'm thinking that the problem should be with the way that we have handled this here and so we have if

311
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.960
the ball is moving our force, so this is going to be our main condition.

312
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.760
Right.

313
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:07.640
And the when the ball when the angle is minus bounce angle, it means that the ball is no longer moving

314
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.210
upwards.

315
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.360
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut all of that.

316
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.940
I'm going to cut because this condition is going to end right here.

317
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.450
This is the F Closs and the other one is going to be the alse Closs.

318
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:28.520
So in the LS, what we have is we basically have the same thing, but we are going to change the signs

319
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:28.940
for that.

320
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:37.280
So if the angle is less than the minus, we are going to set it to minus if if the angle is greater

321
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.060
than the.

322
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:47.150
So in this case, it is going to be if the minimum if the angle is greater than the minus minimum bounce

323
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.820
angle, we are going to set it to that because we don't want it to go smaller.

324
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.360
Right.

325
00:24:52.370 --> 00:25:00.920
And if the angle is less than the math that pi now we are going to multiply this entire thing by plus.

326
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.930
So that is going to be plus and this is going to be minus.

327
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:11.160
So if math that pi if the angle is less than this, we are going to set it equal to this.

328
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:17.870
So let me put it right here and then we are going to call in our appli ball speed and we're going to

329
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.500
pass and the angle that we have.

330
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.810
So let me check this out.

331
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.230
So there we go.

332
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.370
You can see you saw the spin out of the of the paddle.

333
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.490
There is another spin.

334
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.370
And that was the spin from the brick.

335
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.260
See, this is the spin, right?

336
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.210
So.

337
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.730
And this was the spin from the wall, so all of them, they are spinning correctly.

338
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.150
She and now you should.

339
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.070
Take a look at this and there we go.

340
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.940
So what are we going to do as I'm just going to play the final version once?

341
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:17.090
All right, seems to be working correctly, but our version spin seems to be a bit larger than the spin

342
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.110
that that we have for the final version, right.

343
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.310
So this version is I think the spin is larger.

344
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.480
I don't know why that is.

345
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:33.010
Maybe like the ball spin is greater, C, C that this is really large.

346
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.580
So let's go to top.

347
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:43.610
And what what I want to do is I want to check the the ball spin so our o the ball spin is, you know,

348
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.310
we set it to this but we did not reduce it.

349
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.230
So the ball spin should be zero point two and I just put it to zero point to now.

350
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.960
It shouldn't be like that extreme of a spin.

351
00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:01.610
So we should see, we should still see some spin, but not that extreme amount that we saw previously.

352
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.530
Right, so.

353
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.510
I'm not seeing.

354
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.410
There we go.

355
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.080
That was one spin from the panel.

356
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.570
And that's another spin from the break from the brick.

357
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.670
So both of them work.

358
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.300
Let's take a look at a spin from the wall.

359
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:21.290
That's another one.

360
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:29.790
There we go, that's another one from the brick, the wall should also spin the ball a little.

361
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.100
So, uh huh.

362
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.970
Even we saw that in our previous condition.

363
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.760
So what I'm going to do, I'm not going to go ahead and waste more time with that.

364
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.710
You can go ahead and you can play around with it.

365
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:44.670
Right.

366
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.870
And we are done with the with this part.

367
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:57.520
The next part that we will be doing is we will handle scores and lives and we will also print them.

368
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:04.710
So there is one more thing that before forgetting, I have to show you that collapse these functions.

369
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.310
Where is our new game function?

370
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.330
New game function right here.

371
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.030
So you see that we have set the level to one.

372
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.230
If you set the level to two, this is what you're going to get.

373
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.510
So you can see that we have more rows here.

374
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.100
If you set it to three, you're going to get.

375
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.230
Save it.

376
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:27.550
You are going to get more gross and finally, if you set it to turn, this is the amount that you're

377
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.050
going to get and this is going to be the maximum level.

378
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:36.250
So if you start breaking, this is when you get to level 10, it is going to be really difficult for

379
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.260
you to navigate and also really challenging.

380
00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.890
That's why it's level 10.

381
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:49.320
So you how you will have to work like this and what are going to do eventually is we want this levels,

382
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.670
these levels to show automatically.

383
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.700
And what I wanted to show you here, as you can see, that we have red and down below we have green

384
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:07.450
and have this color is gradually changing from red to orange to yellow to light green and then to perfect

385
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:07.870
green.

386
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:15.400
I just wanted to show you this, and I'm going to set it back to zero, which is going to be our first

387
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.260
level all the way to ten level.

388
00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.340
So that's it.

389
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.140
See you guys in the next lecture.
