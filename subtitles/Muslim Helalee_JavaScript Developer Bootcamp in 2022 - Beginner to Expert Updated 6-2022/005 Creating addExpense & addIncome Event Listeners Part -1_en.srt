00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,540
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:09,770
In this lecture, we are going to create an add expense and an ADD and come eventless dinner.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:20,830
All right, so so far, what we have implemented in the end regarding this application is whenever we

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,270
click on any tab, we can see the information related to that.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,980
OK, now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say.

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:42,500
And expense, I'm going to create an event listener for the ad expense and expense event unless Tegner

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:43,670
right.

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,010
And we are going to create one for ad income.

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,160
Now, these are listeners.

10
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,260
They are going to be received in income.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,340
They are going to be fired or received by us as developers.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,940
Whenever the user either clicks on this ad button or the user clicks or just the user presses the enter.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,410
Now, there are two.

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,010
If the keyboard if your computer keyboard is like the big, big ones, I don't know what they're called.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,390
If they have like a calculator on the side, for example, on the on the right, if you have that sort

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,800
of keyboard, it means that you have to enter keys to return keys.

17
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,180
One is in your regular key, the other keyboard and the other one is in your calculator on the side,

18
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,970
which is beneath this plus sign.

19
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,620
OK, I can show you because this is a screen recording, not a keyboard recording.

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,060
But what I mean is you have you have to enter keys.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,790
So if I go ahead and if I take a look at this one, I think this is the regular one.

22
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,480
Yeah, we don't have any.

23
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,730
So if I go ahead and if I increase it, still just the keys soon here.

24
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,040
We just have one in Turkey.

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,180
But if you have a calculator on this side, then right here instead of these two buttons, you're going

26
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,550
to see another in Turkey.

27
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:18,200
So whenever the user either presses this enter or this one on the right bottom side and or the user

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,420
presses this, add clicks this add button, what do we want to do?

29
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,530
We want to run a certain function.

30
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,710
Now, that certain function depends on two things.

31
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,970
One, is it the income or is it the expense?

32
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,760
So if it is the income, we are going to run a budget and function.

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,710
If it is an expense, we are going to run a budget out function.

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,450
So let's go ahead and let's implement this functionality.

35
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,740
So for this, I'm going to grab our add expense button.

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,190
Right.

37
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,960
And let's go ahead.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,960
And let's just very quickly take a look at this.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,090
What this is.

40
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,990
So this is the ad expense.

41
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,630
These are our input buttons and this is the input which has a type of submit.

42
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,730
And if I come here, this is actually our input adding ad add expense.

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,840
So when the user clicks this button or presses both of either of those enter keys, I want to do the

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,550
same thing.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,820
So out of listener, what is the event that we are listening for?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
It is going to be click and when the click happens, I want to run a budget out function.

47
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,120
Now what is this budget about function and why don't I specify it here?

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,750
Because I'm going to call this function more than once.

49
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,010
I need to like create a standalone OK, not inside.

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,550
I like not as a callback function.

51
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,210
Right.

52
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,030
So I'm just I'm going to call it the budget out.

53
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,750
And for the add income, even the center, we are going to grab the add income that add a wellness center

54
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,270
and we are going to listen for a click.

55
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,460
But the function is going to be different.

56
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:03,770
Well, it is going to be budget and OK, so this is one is income and the other one is outcome or expense.

57
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,030
So now before diving into the function, I want to create another event listener as well.

58
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,140
And in that of a listener, we are going to listen for a key press and I'm going to trace whether that

59
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,160
key is the in Turkey or not.

60
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:20,990
All right.

61
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,370
So I'm going to say.

62
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:35,470
We could we could call it add expense and tur key, we could call it add expense in Turkey or.

63
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:45,320
The I think we could call it both of that, so because this is going to be the same for both of them

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,540
in Turkey event.

65
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,200
Listen.

66
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,250
All right, so what do I want this event to be attached on?

67
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,510
I want this to attach it to be attached on the document.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:05,020
And whenever on the document, which is our e-mail page, we we receive a key press.

69
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,890
Now, we have talked about the key press.

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,100
We have a key down whenever the key is pressed down, key up whenever the key is pressed up again.

71
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:21,020
But when when we have a key down plus key up, we have a key press, we are going to run a certain function.

72
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,920
But this function, this is going to be a callback function because I want to trace our event object

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,460
now because this is on the document and key press and literally we have 100 more than 100 keys.

74
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,890
We want to trace a certain key.

75
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:46,660
We want to find out if the IDOT key is not equal to enter.

76
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:54,080
So this is the name of the turkey or if it is not equal to enter, we want to return the function.

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,600
So unless the user presses the turkey, we are unless the user presses, we are not going to run that

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,070
function.

79
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,340
So we could just go ahead and see that in action.

80
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:14,550
So I'm just going to say, hmm, the enter key is pressed, so let's save it.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,730
Let's come and tell our application and let's go to inspect.

82
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,160
So in here we can send the budget out as not.

83
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,020
We are going to define that.

84
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,970
So until we do, let's go ahead and comment them out to not get any more errors are right.

85
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,590
So we are inside our documents.

86
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:37,030
So if I click here and if I press, for example, the shift key, nothing happens.

87
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,470
But if I press the enter key, we can see that the entire case is prÃ©cis is pressed.

88
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,340
Right.

89
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,740
And now if I even press the other enter key, we are going to see that and this.

90
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,130
And how does this actually work?

91
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,010
I can show you I can just go ahead and log the event itself whenever we press the turkey.

92
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,460
So this is the event.

93
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,240
Keep it.

94
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,370
Pay attention.

95
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,910
I'm not going to collapse it.

96
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm not going to expand it.

97
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,660
So this key, it says enter.

98
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,330
We can see that the event is an object, right?

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,150
Objects.

100
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,600
They are key value pairs and they have properties and methods.

101
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,970
We are interested in the key property.

102
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,050
And if I come down, it's says key and the value for that is enter.

103
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,920
Now keep this in mind.

104
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,590
So if I just remove this, if I press the first kind of enter and the second kind of enter, now you're

105
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,900
going to see what what, what is it, what it is that I exactly mean.

106
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,240
So both of them have in Kiev enter, but this one has the first one, which is the real enter key.

107
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,410
It says enter, but the second one, it says numpad enter and the location is different.

108
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,860
See, even the key code, that should be different as well.

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,450
So the key code for this one is thirteen.

110
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,490
But I think now the key code is the same.

111
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,170
Only the location is different.

112
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,880
So the location for the original enter key is zero.

113
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,520
But for the numpad in Turkey, which is numpad enter, it is going to be three.

114
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,950
But what do they have in common?

115
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,260
They have in common the key.

116
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,530
So you could write this in another way.

117
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,770
You could just add a like chain, like a logical or a logical or operator.

118
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:30,160
But instead of doing that and complicating this code, I just went ahead and said, enter, OK.

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,880
And if the key that we have not a of the key that we have clicked on is not enter return, it means

120
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,559
do not like calculate this function, just pack it up and go.

121
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,429
All right.

122
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:47,310
But if what do we have clicked on is the enter key, what do we want?

123
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,180
We want to run two functions.

124
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,800
So the first function is going to be budget out and we are going to pass in the event object.

125
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,960
The second one is going to be budget and budget.

126
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:06,280
And because whenever we pressed the enter key, it is going to be either the add expense or the add

127
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,700
income.

128
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,360
So the budget out is going to be rendered when we press on the add expense and budget and on the add

129
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,710
income.

130
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,300
So now I'm going to come in these guys back and let's go ahead and let's create these two functions.

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,060
So I'm going to say budget out.

132
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,380
We could go either way.

133
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,960
We could we could create the budget out and then the budget and or the other way around doesn't really

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,350
matter.

135
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:38,710
So we have a function that is budget out there where we are going to pass and the event object, notice

136
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,760
that this is green because this function is is defined.

137
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:52,190
And in case you're wondering what kind of theme this is, this is the Dracula theme control katee a

138
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,660
right.

139
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,620
That is the short shortcut control capability.

140
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,350
And this is this Dracula theme.

141
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,420
You can see I have like a ton of themes.

142
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,650
I'd like to change up themes in my during the recording, during the recording of my courses.

143
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,570
So if you have followed my other courses, my previous course, the Flexibles course, I've changed

144
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,310
theme like three times.

145
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,570
This is what I do.

146
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,330
I like to keep things like a diversion like like, hmm.

147
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,500
What is the word.

148
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,330
I want to change things up so I'm not going to first we had this dark visual studio, but we just changed

149
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,950
it to Dracula.

150
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:39,220
Another cool one if you're looking for is Cobalt two, which is a blue theme, very, very soft on the

151
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,520
ice.

152
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,940
So I really pay attention to whether or not the theme, that specific theme hurts my eyes or not.

153
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,230
So that's really important.

154
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,430
All right.

155
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,770
So budget out.

156
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,880
What do we want to do here?

157
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,610
First off, because we are working with a form, I'm going to prevent the default behavior.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,340
So prevent default behavior.

159
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,160
We do not want the form to supplement, OK, because this is an input type of submit and this is a form

160
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,140
element and it is going to submit.

161
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,760
We are we do not want to do that.

162
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,730
Now, what do we want to do?

163
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:27,780
Is whenever if if what we have clicked on is if what we enter right is not the title or nor the amount,

164
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,840
we do not want to run the function, what do I mean by this?

165
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,910
So we are going to use our not operator and we are going to say expense.

166
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:47,640
Title dot value f f the expense title, that value is null or the expense.

167
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,270
Amount where the amount that value is now.

168
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,300
We want to return this function.

169
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,590
Now, what does this mean?

170
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,040
It means, OK, budget, and we are going to define that.

171
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,490
Don't worry.

172
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,000
So it means that if we are in the expense and there was nothing written inside these fields, when the

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,270
user clicks add we do not want to print anything.

174
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,320
This is basically preventing the user from doing that.

175
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,690
Now let's create an expense object.

176
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:28,250
Now this object is going to be the first item which we are going to push to this entry list array and

177
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,710
that array is going to be stored inside our local storage as well as be displayed on the UI.

178
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,340
So first off, the first key that I want to pass is going to be type and I'm going to call it expense.

179
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,460
Then we are going to have our title.

180
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,450
Now what what does the title is going to be?

181
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,560
The title is going to be expense title data value.

182
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,880
So whatever the title is going to be, whatever value the user puts there.

183
00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:00,460
And finally, the amount, what is the amount, the amount is going to be expense.

184
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,580
Amount dot value, whatever the user writes.

185
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:13,800
And then we are going to grab this expense and we are going to push it to the end, shrillest dot push

186
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,220
because we want to add items stoehr list.

187
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,910
We are going to use the push method.

188
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,550
And what is the item name?

189
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,540
It is expense.

190
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,260
OK, and we could go ahead and say Kansa log expense.

191
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:37,040
OK, so what do we have actually inside the expense, so if I it still says budget and I mean it's so.

192
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,410
OK, that's coming that out.

193
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,210
Let's come here.

194
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:48,780
So if I go ahead and if I say rent and say 2000 and when I click add, we can see that it has been added

195
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:48,990
here.

196
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,230
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to zoom out.

197
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,760
I'm sure you can still see this UI.

198
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,550
I just want to work with this one more.

199
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,460
So it is exactly our object.

200
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,170
The object has an amount of 2000 tied on a front type of expense.

201
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,820
I know this video is 14 minutes and I'd like to keep videos short in this course.

202
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,520
I haven't done a good job of that.

203
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,650
But there is something that I want to show you.

204
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,750
Notice this 2000.

205
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,590
This is not a number.

206
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,740
This is a string.

207
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,440
So how do we know that there is another operator in JavaScript and that is the type of operator.

208
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:33,720
So if I go ahead and if I say type of expense.

209
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:49,090
Type of expense, let's grab the first one and OK, so let's add it rent to like let's say 200 and Klegg,

210
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,040
it is going to say undefined.

211
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't think it has grabbed it.

212
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,490
Type O, it should be this, not this one.

213
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,330
It is expense.

214
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,800
It should be number two.

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,330
I think we should be able to grab it, grab the type.

216
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,870
If we couldn't then we are getting you, we are going to go a different route.

217
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:17,770
If I click on it it still says undefined expense to oh sorry I should say that amount.

218
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,170
Type of that amount.

219
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:29,150
That's like I was accessing it like an array, and that is not an array and it says a string, it means

220
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,400
that this number is actually string.

221
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,760
We don't want it to be a string, because if this is if this number is a string, what does that mean?

222
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:46,010
It means that we cannot add it like we cannot say two plus two because it's a string.

223
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,310
It is going to grab two plus two and it is going to give us 22 because it is going to put the other

224
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,180
two right next to it.

225
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,500
So there is a method called pass.

226
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,940
We could go pass, float or pass integer.

227
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,070
It doesn't really matter.

228
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,320
This is the method.

229
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,890
It is going to grab a string and it is convert that into a floating point number.

230
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:16,640
We could say pass integer in T and it is going to tell us it is going to give us this information,

231
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,540
a value between two and thirty six that specifies the base of the number and num string a strength to

232
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,700
strength to convert into a number.

233
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,240
Right.

234
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,300
So this is going to convert a string to a number.

235
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,110
And let's say expense amount, dot value.

236
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:43,140
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cancel that log our expense and then we are going

237
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,960
to cancel log type of that.

238
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,560
So let's enter that.

239
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,600
Let's say rent one hundred.

240
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,180
And if I click on it now, it says a number.

241
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,320
And now you guys can see that this is not surrounded by quotes.

242
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,490
This is blue.

243
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,360
It means that this is a number and type of operator says that this is actually a number.

244
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,619
This is it for this letter.

245
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,150
See you guys in the next one.
