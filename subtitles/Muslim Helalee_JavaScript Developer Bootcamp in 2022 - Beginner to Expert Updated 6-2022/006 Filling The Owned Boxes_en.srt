1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,470
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will handle filling the boxes.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,760
All right, so let's go ahead.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,920
Actually.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,380
Create the logic for that.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,600
So what I'm going to do inside are we're just going to collapse this one for now inside our Haisla and

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,000
select site right beneath here.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,040
What I would like to do here is.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,920
We are going to select and fill the square, right?

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,580
So, first off, I'm going to create a variable and that is going to be filled square and I'm going

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,180
to set it to false because initially we don't have any squares filled.

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:51,240
Then we are going to loop over our current selves for let sell of current cells if.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,460
Our squares.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:05,420
If our squares and in the squares we have rows and in the squares, we also have columns or so we have

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,220
row column, if that's going to be if that side is selected.

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,290
So we are going to call in our select site.

16
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:19,900
If that is selected, we are going to say that the right.

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,310
So let's get out of here as well.

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,960
We are going to say that Failed Square is going to be true.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,940
Right?

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:35,630
So if it is that the highlighted the selected side and after all the selected sites are selected, then

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,270
we are going to say that that square is actually filled.

22
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,570
And right after that, I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to cut this and I'm going to

23
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,260
put it right after for a loop.

24
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,870
So we're for a loop ends right here.

25
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,270
And I'm going to cut this one as well.

26
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,150
And I'm going to tell you where we should put that, because we need to check for the scores as well.

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,720
And then we would like to switch the player.

28
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,470
So f the square is true.

29
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,419
Felt square is true.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,830
What it is that we want we would want to do in here.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,340
I'm going to put in for now a comment that is we are going to handle game over and we're going to handle

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,910
it later.

33
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,240
For now, we have other things that we need to take care of and in the else we are going to switch the

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,720
player's turn right.

35
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,670
So, so far, so good.

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,610
And what I'm going to do here is I think we have created a variable called.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't think have we created that numb, selected?

38
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:53,920
Oh, it is inside the square class, so we have created this numb selected and and this is going to

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
give us the number of sites which are selected.

40
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,240
If they are more than if they are equal to exactly four, then we are going to fill that square.

41
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,880
Right.

42
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:12,070
So this is going to give us if that is if we need to fill that site so within our class.

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,750
Within the class of the square.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,220
Let me take a look at this, should we should we do it?

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,410
Yeah, we are going to do it within this class of square.

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,060
We are going to go ahead and we are going to select the number selected and we are going to increase

47
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,040
it whenever any side is actually selected.

48
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,450
So we're in our square class where it is that we are selecting sites.

49
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,700
We are selecting sites right here.

50
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,240
OK.

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,040
So in here, hmm?

52
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:55,560
So the way that I'm doing this is going to be so here we have a switch statement and this is going to

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,410
highlight each side is going to select the highlighted side.

54
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,740
It is not going to highlight it.

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,130
It is going to select that side and is going to grab the owner and it is going to set it to whichever

56
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,720
place players turn.

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,080
It is.

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,440
And it is going to say that, yes, it is selected.

59
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,570
Right.

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:24,030
And if all of the switch statement does not return anything, what we would like to do that is in here,

61
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:31,050
as we would like to say that the highlight is not right because none of the sides have been selected.

62
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,770
That's why the highlight is, you know, and right after that, I'm going to grab or numb selected and

63
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,300
I'm going to incremented by one.

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,170
Right.

65
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,320
And we are going to say if if this dot, the number of selected is exactly equal to four, then we want

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,690
to basically give that the the owner who has completed four of the sites or has put on the last side.

67
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,920
We want to give it another turn.

68
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,680
So we are going to say this stud owner is going to be player's turn.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,840
We are going to give it another turn.

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,230
Now, inside here is where we are going to handle the score.

71
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,990
So I'm just going to put in a comment and we are going to come back later and then we want this if statement

72
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,680
to return.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,060
True.

74
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:20,720
Right.

75
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,460
So we wanted to return true for this.

76
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:30,030
And if this if statement does not return true, we want to return false.

77
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,660
It means that that a player has not completed four sides and we do not want to give it any anything,

78
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,820
any bonus or anything for that, for that matter.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,950
So let's save this.

80
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,470
Let's come inside the browser.

81
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,110
So let's go ahead and let's actually test this.

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:52,210
So if any player completes the fourth side, they should get another turn.

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,210
So now we didn't get another turn, we should have gotten let me reload this.

84
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:10,080
And now it is not it is always switching the player from one player to the next player.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,980
All right.

86
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,600
So let's go ahead and let's actually check what is happening here.

87
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:23,280
So in here, what we did was we said that if it still does not return highlight, we want the highlight

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,720
to be null and we incremented the NUM selected and then we are going to save this Dunnam selected Asfour.

89
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,550
We want to we want to set that to the player's turn and we want to return.

90
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:35,850
True.

91
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,340
If it doesn't return true, we want to return false.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,940
But we have implemented that in in our select site.

93
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,610
And now taking a look at this, you can see that we are iterating over this select site twice.

94
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,370
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to get rid of that.

95
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,380
And I'm going to say select.

96
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,770
Side once, and I'm going to save it and we are going to come here and now we have to check if that

97
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,640
is going to work.

98
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:12,670
All right, so let's go ahead and select this, we have orange, we have green, we have orange.

99
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,840
Now, if I fill this, the green should get another turn.

100
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,410
There we go.

101
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:26,770
So I'm going to I'm going to let the orange fill this one and the orange when the orange completes the

102
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,370
square, the orange is going to claim another turn as well.

103
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,950
There we go.

104
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,050
It is the orange.

105
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,290
Just turn and then this is the orange.

106
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,930
And then we should get another turn and there we go.

107
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,120
So that is completed as well.

108
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,780
We have successfully handed over the turn to whoever has completed that.

109
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:54,670
The next logical thing for us to do is just to go ahead and grab that long awaited draw, fill function

110
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,590
and actually draw something with it.

111
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,050
All right.

112
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:07,630
So in here, what I would like to do first is we would like to do we would like to know if that box

113
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,790
is not doesn't have any owner.

114
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,070
If it doesn't have any owner, then we would like to return.

115
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,170
If it if the owner is.

116
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,230
No, it means it doesn't have any owner we would like to return.

117
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,180
All right.

118
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,700
So in here, let's say F.

119
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:36,690
This stud owner is not if it is, if the if there is no owner, we come on, we would like to return

120
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,289
from their.

121
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,980
All right, so I'm just going to say a return, otherwise we want to provide there a light background,

122
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,620
so draw a light background.

123
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,000
So let's grab our context and we're going to say Phil style, the film style is going to get color from

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,940
whichever players turn it is or whoever owns that sell it is going to grab it.

125
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:16,200
And we are going to say true, because we want we want to grab the light version of the color, not

126
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
the solid version.

127
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,530
And then we need to draw that.

128
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,050
So we are going to say Phil Rect.

129
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:31,660
Phil wrecked and in here, the position is going to be this dot left, plus our stroke.

130
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,640
And the white position is going to be this top plus the stroke.

131
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:51,220
The width is going to be this start with minus two times the strokes with two times the strokes dimension,

132
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,600
and we are going to have the same thing for the height as well.

133
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,720
But we are going to change it to this day and age.

134
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,220
All right.

135
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,080
So let's go ahead and let's save it.

136
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,740
Let's see if it actually works out right.

137
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,670
There we go.

138
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,290
You can see that basically the stroke will allow us to you can see that the little space that there

139
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,530
is between this line and the starting of this box, that is going to be our stroke.

140
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,790
That's why we gave it a stroke.

141
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,530
It is just for aesthetic purposes.

142
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,840
The next thing that I would like to do is I would like to draw our text.

143
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,890
So let's go ahead and let's let's actually create the function for that.

144
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,910
So this is a new game.

145
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,570
This is select site.

146
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,290
We have or get color function there.

147
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:49,280
And in here, I'm going to create a function for drawing the text.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,180
So I'm going to call it draw text function.

149
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,750
So let's say function, draw text.

150
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,850
So so far, everything is going really well in here.

151
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,830
We are going to pass in the text.

152
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,430
Now, this function is going to be called multiple times.

153
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:15,710
And whenever it is called, we are just going to call whenever we want to draw a text, we are just

154
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:22,970
going to call, this is going to have a position of X and then why the color and the size?

155
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:38,530
So they can start Phil style is going to be the color than the iconic start font is going to be our

156
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,640
the size.

157
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:46,840
First off, let's provide the size and then the unit, which is pixels and then the font family, which

158
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,130
is sans serif.

159
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,310
You can provide any font family that you want.

160
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,640
Then we have our context filled text.

161
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,620
We should pass in the text, the exposition and the wife is perfect.

162
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,260
So we have created our draw text function.

163
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:13,860
What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to top and I'm going to create some variables for our text as

164
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,140
well.

165
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,110
So let's calm down our colors in here.

166
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,940
I'm going to say text variables.

167
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,540
Variables, I think, like this.

168
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:35,730
So first things first, we need a text for A.I. In this case, it is going to be player two, but I'm

169
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,170
just going to set it at A.I., but I'm going to give the text as player two and then I'm just going

170
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,780
to copy a bunch of times.

171
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,630
So then we are going to have a small text.

172
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,220
Now, keep in mind that one of the texts I'm going to I'm just going to say I smell one of the texts

173
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,720
is going to appear here.

174
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:04,470
The bigger text is going to appear here, like the complete name, player one, and then P1 or P2.

175
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,110
They're going to appear within the boxes.

176
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,550
So we need two versions of texts.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,720
And it is going to be up to then we have our text player.

178
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:28,360
Which is going to be player one, then we have the text of player SML, which is going to be one.

179
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,430
Perfect.

180
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,360
So right after that, we are going to have our.

181
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,490
Text size, cell size cell, which is going to be equal to the cell.

182
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:52,090
Cell, our cell divided by now, you can increase this if you are divided by two, the text is going

183
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,110
to get increased.

184
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,790
If you divide it by three, the text is going to get even smaller.

185
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,920
So it depends on these dimensions are not hard coded.

186
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,890
You can change them if you want.

187
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,100
Then we need to have a text size top.

188
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,380
Which I'm just going to set it to text size top and it is going to be the margin.

189
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:23,710
Our margin that we have divided by six, we are going to have a text when it when it is a tie, not

190
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:31,150
term, it is tie and we are just going to say draw and then we are going to have a text when someone

191
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,610
wins and we are going to say one.

192
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:41,770
Basically, we are going to say either player won one or a player to one and then we don't need this

193
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,300
anymore.

194
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,930
So let's save that.

195
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:53,370
And let's go ahead and let's create a function that is going to give us our text and I'm going to call

196
00:14:53,370 --> 00:15:00,600
that get text, so I'm just going to collapse that collapse this this one.

197
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,810
We have our get color right beneath there.

198
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,450
I'm going to grab that comment, put it right here.

199
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,420
We are going to call this get text.

200
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,520
Right.

201
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,480
And within this function, we want to check which players turn it this.

202
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,970
So we show either the small text or the object, the bigger text.

203
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,140
So first off, we need to check for that.

204
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,750
So we are going to say function, get text.

205
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,040
Right.

206
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,640
And.

207
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:38,760
And here, I'm just going to capitalize this one, and in here we're going to pass in player and we're

208
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:46,440
going to pass in small, we're going to say if it is the player, if it is the player's turn, we are

209
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,980
going to return and the return we are going to check for something.

210
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:59,280
If it is small, we are going to return text player small, otherwise we are going to return text player

211
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,280
or else it means that it is not the player's turn, it is the other players turn.

212
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,110
We are going to check for small.

213
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,960
If it is small, we are going to return the other players text, which is a small and or if a small

214
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,320
is not true, we are going to return the bigger text.

215
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,940
I became so we have created this function as well.

216
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,870
Now let's go ahead and let's actually.

217
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:40,610
Use this function somewhere, so inside our drawerful method that we have right here down beneath this,

218
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,510
what I would like to do is I would like to draw the owner's text.

219
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:52,380
So owner text and we are going to say draw a text.

220
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:01,450
Perfect, so inside the draw text, what do we have, we should pass in a text X, Y, color and size,

221
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,240
right?

222
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,310
So for the X.

223
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,660
Sorry for the text I'm going to pass in whichever text it is, it is going to be that get text function

224
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,920
that we just created and we are going to say this stud owner and we are going to set it to true.

225
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,140
I'm going to pass on a comment and I'm going to hit enter because we are going to have many of these.

226
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:34,290
The way that I will be creating this is going to be like exactly this, because this is a function call

227
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,640
of our draw text.

228
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,830
This is the draw text function.

229
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,710
We're basically calling that function down there.

230
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,820
But inside the function call, we are going to pass in many arguments.

231
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,230
So I'm just going to divide them line by line so it is easier for you to understand.

232
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,010
Now let's go ahead and start passing the exposition, which is going to be this star left, plus this

233
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,830
W time, half of this half of the width of that box.

234
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,800
The U.S. position is going to be the top of the box, plus half of the height of the box.

235
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,870
Where are we?

236
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,400
OK, so let's just hit enter, put in a comma there.

237
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,290
OK, so what is the next one we need to pass and the color.

238
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,870
So for the color, we are going to call in our get color function.

239
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,250
We are going to pass and the owner there.

240
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,130
And because we want to grab the.

241
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,600
A nice daylight color.

242
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,770
We are going to say false.

243
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,640
And finally, what is the size?

244
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,490
The size is going to be the text size cell.

245
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Let's save that and let's come here.

246
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,050
OK, we don't see our text in here.

247
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,020
Oh, it should be within this.

248
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,930
We are basically drawing it within this box.

249
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,420
So let's check it out now.

250
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,260
It should be player, too.

251
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,150
There we go.

252
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,820
It is players, too, and we get another turn.

253
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,200
And at this time it should be player one.

254
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,420
And you can see that this is light orange and this is that dark orange.

255
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,040
It's not dark.

256
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
It doesn't have any opacity.

257
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,230
And thus this green has opacity and it doesn't have any of it.

258
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:26,770
So basically, when any of the players when the color of their text for their box is going to be the

259
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,430
color of their line as well as that color is going to be a.

260
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,830
And like it, we like sort of transparent color of their line.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,750
So they completely match.

262
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,880
I'm sure you know what I mean by looking at this, so we were successful, we were able to successfully

263
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,530
draw the text within these boxes.

264
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:58,030
The next logical step for us is going to be drawing the scores and actually creating the players there,

265
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,710
drawing the scores there.

266
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:06,070
And right after that, we are going to cover handling the game over status.

267
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,700
So I'm not going to go ahead and I'm not going to go over the score.

268
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,840
And this lecture, we are going to cover score in our next lecture.

269
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,940
And right after that lecture, we are going to cover whenever the game is over.

270
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,180
What should we do then?

271
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,780
So see you guys in the next lecture.
