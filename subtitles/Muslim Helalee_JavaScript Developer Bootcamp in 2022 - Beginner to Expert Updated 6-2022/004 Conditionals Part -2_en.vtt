00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.670
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:07.510
In this lecture, we are going to take a look at another way of writing conditionals in JavaScript.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.190
All right, so we have talked about the statements now what I want to talk about is the switch statement,

4
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.720
which kind of does the same thing as if statements.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.640
So the first scenario that we are going to cover is checking.

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.690
Checking for a single condition, right, so first off, we are going to check for a single condition.

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.760
Now, let's go ahead and let's talk about the swift statements and swift statements.

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.780
They are different in their syntax from if statements whenever you want to create a switch statement

9
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.500
conditional.

10
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.240
First off, you have to specify your variable.

11
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
So we are going to go ahead and we are going to Grabowsky, for example, and we are going to set it

12
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.350
to 10.

13
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.460
All right, and then the syntax for switch statement is, first off, we the switch key word and then

14
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.960
open parentheses and then open curly braces.

15
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.360
So if and here comes the variable name.

16
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.930
Right.

17
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.630
The score, but this is not our condition, our condition is going to be inside, our condition is going

18
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.560
to be inside our curly braces.

19
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.930
All right.

20
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.740
So this is how different they are.

21
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.270
All right.

22
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920
So this is our variable.

23
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260
What do we want to do with this variable?

24
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.170
So we want to what do we want to do?

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.400
We want to provide it with a condition.

26
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.240
So if the condition in the condition that the score is equal to 10, we want to it to the console.

27
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.350
What grade A..

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.050
All right.

29
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.540
I'm going to go over this syntax one more time.

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.370
So we say that the initial value of this core variable is going to be the number 10.

31
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.770
And in the switch statement, we grab that score and we say in case in case the score is ten, we want

32
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.820
to print to the console.

33
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.169
Great.

34
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.970
And keep in mind that this is cool.

35
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.560
All right.

36
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.870
This is not semicolon.

37
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.790
This is just simple.

38
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.350
I'm going to zoom in for you so you guys can see this is Colon.

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.650
All right.

40
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.480
This is semicolon, but this is colon.

41
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.750
And when you provide colon and JavaScript and when you hit, I'm just going to go ahead and cut this

42
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.590
one and I'm going to show you how this works.

43
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.510
So when you write Colon and when you hit enter or or the return, whatever you want to call it, when

44
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.240
you enter, you can see that it has been indented by two tabs.

45
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.520
All right.

46
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.870
And then this code is going to run.

47
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.540
So think of this.

48
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:54.000
Think of this part as your condition and this part as the code that you want to run in case your condition

49
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.930
has been met.

50
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.620
Right.

51
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.080
So this is how this is going to work.

52
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.650
We are just going to go ahead and zoom out of it.

53
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.150
All right.

54
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.680
So we are going to save it now because the score is 10.

55
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.040
We are going to see great a what if we change it to 11?

56
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.700
We are not going to see anything because we don't have any other scenario that we want to run here.

57
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.770
We do have any other scenarios for switch statements as well.

58
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.890
So this is a switch statement checking for a single condition.

59
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:35.700
We also have a default statement in which we can check for two conditions, default statement.

60
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.940
And we are going to say checking for two conditions.

61
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.140
All right, so first off, let's go ahead and let's create our variable, which is score, and we are

62
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.310
going to put it to ten.

63
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.060
All right.

64
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.540
And then in the switch, what do we want to do?

65
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.190
We want to include that variable because we want to apply some conditions on that variable.

66
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.230
So in case the variable has a value of 10, we want to present to the console great a right.

67
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.420
We want to present to the concert grade eight.

68
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.610
What if the what if the score is not 10?

69
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.040
So what if in that case, what happens in that case?

70
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.930
So in that case, whenever I hit enter here, you guys can see that it is still indented.

71
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.620
So what we are going to do is we are going to hit backspace once and we are going to provide a default

72
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.430
statement.

73
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.710
And think of this default statement as the statement that we had in our in our previous lecture for

74
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.420
conditionals.

75
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.720
So in the default statement, what I want to do is I want to provide just great.

76
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.110
So let's go ahead and let's save it.

77
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.040
Now, you guys can see we print out grade eight and grade B now here is here is the important part about

78
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.840
the switch statements that whenever you provide a condition, you have to break out of that condition.

79
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.720
So the break key has to be written here.

80
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.040
And it is so simple.

81
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.970
You just write break.

82
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.800
So now when this condition is met, we do not want the other code to run.

83
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.630
That's why we just break out of this and that's it.

84
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.590
But if you do not provide with this key word, this condition is going to begin to run and this one

85
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.620
is going to run as well.

86
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.850
So now the score is 10.

87
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.640
We see grade A, let's put it to score nine and we should see grade, which we can write.

88
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.550
So this is this is the default statement checking for two conditions.

89
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.380
And now things are going to get interesting because now we are going to take a look at this, which.

90
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.490
Switch default.

91
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.930
All right, switch the false statements in which we can go ahead and we can check for multiple for multiple

92
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:07.880
conditions, statement checking for more than two conditions, right.

93
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.850
So first off, let's go ahead and let's create our variable and let's put it to eight initially, OK?

94
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.130
And we are going to write the syntax for a swift statement, and we are going to reference that variable

95
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.480
here.

96
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.000
Right.

97
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.650
And OK, now let's go ahead and let's write our conditions.

98
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.800
So in case the variable has a value of 10, what do we want to do?

99
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.980
We want to run.

100
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.840
We want to print to the council grade, not grade B, we are going to print to the council grade eight.

101
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.360
And when that code runs, we want to break out of it.

102
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.940
So we do not want the remaining code to run as well.

103
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.170
All right.

104
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.660
So in case the score has a value of ten and sorry, the value of nine, what do we want to do?

105
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.220
We want to run this code.

106
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.380
We want to say that grade is B, OK?

107
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.920
And now we we have to break out of it as well.

108
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.290
So what if this this score has a value of eight?

109
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.590
So when the score has a value of eight, we want to print to the council grade C.

110
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.370
Right.

111
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.310
And we are going to break out of it as well.

112
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.840
And when the score has a value of seven, we want to print to the console Grady's.

113
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:34.850
Right, and we are going to break out of it as well, and in any other scenario, this is our default

114
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.030
key, this is our default key word.

115
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.450
And in any other scenario, we just want to print to the console great f but save it.

116
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.440
So because the grade is eight, whereas the grade eight.

117
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.260
So when the grade is eight, we are going to print to the console.

118
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.310
Great story.

119
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.100
When the score is eight, we are going to print to the console.

120
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.460
Great.

121
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.750
See when the score is seven, we are going to print grade.

122
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.170
When the score is five, we are going to print grade F.

123
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.430
When the score is ten, we are going to create a.

124
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:13.430
So whenever you create some sort of logic inside your in your JavaScript, make sure to check it for

125
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.660
every condition.

126
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.210
OK, make sure to give it a value of nine which is great B value of ten which is great.

127
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:28.040
And to make sure that it works the way you want it to work, it works expectedly, not surprisingly.

128
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.340
All right.

129
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.630
You don't want surprises when you are creating logic, right.

130
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.090
That's it for this lecture.

131
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.840
See you guys in the next one.
