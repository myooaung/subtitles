00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:08,810
Hi, everyone, in this culture, I would like to solve a bug with the responsiveness of this game.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,740
All right, so we have come this far, and if I go ahead and if I decrease the width of the window,

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,360
you can see that this the move the position of this panel is not moving at all.

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,820
But if so, if I go ahead and if I make this model, you can see that we had this problem.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,800
If I reload, I know that it is going to start from there.

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,350
Our walls are responsive, but not the position of the panel, nor the ball itself.

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,070
Right.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,960
So what I would like to do first is I would like to address another issue, and that is whenever we

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,310
want to move our paddle the ball, when it is not served, it seems to stay in its place.

10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,160
And when we serve it, it is going to go.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,380
But before serving, it is not going to go anywhere.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,610
So what I would like to do is, first off, go ahead and and fix the updatable position and then we

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,570
will go ahead and implement that responsiveness issue.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:21,570
So in here, what I would like to do is I want I want to move the ball, move the ball with the paddle.

15
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,410
So.

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,870
The panel.

17
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:34,350
All right, so if now we only want to move the ball with the panel when it is not already moving, when

18
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:43,290
it is not moving towards the top, it means that when the ball's y velocity is equal to zero, what

19
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,010
do we want to do?

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,430
We want to grab the balls exposition and we want to set up to Pardo's exposition.

21
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,160
So that should just do it for us.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,330
So I shouldn't serve it.

23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,160
I'm just going to you can see.

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,180
So now that I move the paddle, the ball is going to move.

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:10,110
But whenever you hit into space and now when you move the paddle, the ball is not going to move because

26
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,370
the ball is only going to move with the paddle if the Y velocity zero.

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,460
All right.

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,820
So now that that problem is solved, let's go ahead and let's actually tackle the responsiveness issue

29
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,420
that we have.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,660
So what I'm going to do for that is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to cut the new game function

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,480
called from the down below and let me collapse this function.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,840
And I'm going to come to our set dimensions and I'm going to pace that function.

33
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,490
Where is that?

34
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,290
There we go.

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,870
So I'm going to post it here.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
Why did I do that?

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,960
The reason for that is so if I come on top, you can see that our set dimensions function only is called

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,470
when we receive this event.

39
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,510
So whenever we receive the whenever the window is resized, we want to call the set dimensions as well

40
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,730
as the new game, which is responsible for creating a new game for us.

41
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:13,350
So it doesn't matter if you're playing, if you if I just go ahead and open up this console here.

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,020
So this is the finished game so you can see that I'm playing.

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,570
But whenever I change the size, you can see that the the game is going to reset.

44
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,020
That's what we are actually saying here.

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:31,320
So if I do that and if I change it now, you can see that the the pattern is changing with that as well.

46
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,350
There we go.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,970
So I guess that set for this lecture.

48
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,510
See you guys in the next one.
