1
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:02,610
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,800
In this lecture, we will handle score and lives.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,280
All right, so first off, I'm going to go up there to our game parameters and I'm going to create a

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,650
constant and I'm going to call it game lives and I'm going to set it to three cliche and then we are

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,150
going to have a key.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:33,740
Score, which is going to be safe, Towra, local storage, and it is going to be called high score.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,650
Perfect.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:35,600
All right.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,190
And next up.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:49,850
I would like to create the text for the color, for the text, so I'm going to say color text to 60

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,590
and I'm going to just set it to white.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,420
You can change it to whatever color you like.

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,320
And right after that, I'm going to create another bunch of text property.

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,160
So I'm going to say I'm going to call them text properties.

15
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:11,060
So in the text properties, what we have is first things first, we have our text font.

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,580
So I'm going to say text font.

17
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,220
The text font is going to be sans serif, sans serif.

18
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,870
And then just going to copy it a bunch of times, we are going to have the text level.

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,880
Then we are going to have the text for the lives.

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,170
Should just grab this one, so lives, then we will have the text fourscore.

21
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,830
Perfect, after that, we are going to have the text for high score, which I'm just going to call a

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:55,640
score high, then we will have a text for game over.

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,980
So let's just grab that and let's say game over.

24
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,470
Over and finally, we are going to have a text for when?

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
Now, let's let's grab this.

26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:18,740
So this one is going to be level this one, the lives is going to say just ball, the score is going

27
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:26,080
to say score and the high score is going to say best or you can change it to high score.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm just going to capitalize it.

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,200
The game over is going to say game over.

30
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:41,270
So game over and Cabral's and the win is going to say you won.

31
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,360
So we have created this

32
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,990
next stop.

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,630
I would like to go ahead and I would like to create our levels live score, score high on all of that

34
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,200
as well.

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,030
All right.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
So in here.

37
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,620
Right in here, what I would like to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to.

38
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,020
So here we have our panel, then we have the ball.

39
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,500
Then we have the I'm going to remove the touch from here.

40
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,520
All right.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,220
And then we have our bricks.

42
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,210
Then we have the level, which I'm just going to go ahead and remove it from here as well.

43
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,890
And down below, what I would like to do is why do we have an error?

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,380
Because this is coming, right?

45
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,040
Yep.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,570
There we go.

47
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,510
So I'm going to create I'm going to create a variable left.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,070
It's going to be game over for our game over.

49
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,990
And then we are going to have, you know, what the power up.

50
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,490
So I'm just going to create them here.

51
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,880
Of course, we are going to talk about them in our upcoming lectures.

52
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,560
I just want to make sure that they are created so sticky why we are here.

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,560
So we are going to have the power up for extension, another one for sticky, another one for Super

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,950
Bowl.

55
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,560
And then we are going to have our win text.

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,150
Right after that.

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,740
I'm going to create a real level.

58
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:12,570
And then the lives score score high.

59
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:23,950
OK, this is a score and score high, perfect after that, let's create the number of bricks perfect.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
And let's create the text size.

61
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,560
And in here, I'm going to also add our touch X, so let's save that.

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
Let's come here.

63
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,390
We don't have any error.

64
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,460
We have not messed anything up.

65
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,880
Perfect.

66
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,890
Now, what I would like to do is I would like to go to our set dimensions function.

67
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,610
All right, so where is our said dimension's function?

68
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:00,440
And here, what I would like to do is I would like to create a context for the alignment, for the baseline

69
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,400
of our text.

70
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,570
Right.

71
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,110
And.

72
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:16,010
I'm going to say con eckstut, text, baseline text, not that text baseline, and I'm going to set

73
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,030
it to middle.

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,130
All right, so we have done that as well.

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,450
And after that, what I would like to do is I want to create a new ball, a function, and then where

76
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,920
is our new game function?

77
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,060
Right on top of there.

78
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,190
So I'm going to grab this and I'm going to put it right here.

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,230
Now, you could call this a little bit of refactoring that we do here.

80
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,010
I just want to tidy up some loose ends.

81
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,730
So I'm going to say function.

82
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,740
Kneubuhl This is going to be in charge of creating a new ball for us.

83
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,970
And in here, what I would like to do is I would like to cut everything from there and I would like

84
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,680
to put him here.

85
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,810
I'm not going to save it.

86
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,730
Keep that in mind.

87
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,660
I will.

88
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,310
I'm not going to save it.

89
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,000
And then I'm going to come to our new game.

90
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,480
Let's remove all the space so we have our level.

91
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,260
Let's initially the game over is going to be equal to force.

92
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,500
The score is going to be zero.

93
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:25,380
The when whoever has won is going to be false because no one has won and the lives amount of the lives

94
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,510
is going to be the game lives that we have.

95
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,740
Right.

96
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,570
And in here is.

97
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,430
Right after this, what I would like to do is I want to create another function that is going to be

98
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,870
called new level.

99
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,940
Right, and I'm going to call it beneath this function.

100
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,790
OK, so I'm going to call I'm going to create it there.

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,510
So on top of the out of bounds, in case you're wondering why the out of bounds was here, I think it

102
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,660
was below the set dimensions and I brought it here.

103
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,250
This is the correct place for it.

104
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,930
So just go ahead and copy it and bring it here out of bounds.

105
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:12,880
So in here, what I would like to call create is a new level function and let's say function, new level.

106
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,960
This is going to be responsible for creating a new level for us and in here is where I would like to

107
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,560
go ahead and grab our touch and set it to no.

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,310
All right.

109
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,190
And I'm going to call in the new ball function here and I'm going to call in to create bricks.

110
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,740
Excuse me.

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,760
I would like to call in the create bricks.

112
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,230
OK, so just make this.

113
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,640
Correct.

114
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's put it here.

115
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,980
So this is going to be our new ball function.

116
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,200
Why is it not why is it throwing an error here?

117
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,060
Oh, because of these.

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,450
I see what you say.

119
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,400
So let's remove this.

120
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,910
And in here, I'm going to call our create bricks.

121
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,570
Create bricks function as well.

122
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,780
We're basically calling it here and then.

123
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,970
All right, so inside our new game function.

124
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,810
I no longer want to call the create bricks here, I just want to call the new level function here I

125
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:36,110
would like because inside the new level function, we already called the new the create bricks and also

126
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,950
the new ball.

127
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,870
Function, so where is our touch X, I think we have we are we have never provided it here.

128
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,390
So the touch X is right here.

129
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,050
It is going to be null and ah, right.

130
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:02,580
So from now inside this new game function, I also would like to do our local storage and we are going

131
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,430
to say getting the high score from the local.

132
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,140
Storage perfect.

133
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:22,330
Now we are going to say score a star or score string is going to be equal to local storage, not get

134
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,890
item.

135
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,710
We have not said it, but we are going to set it somewhere and it is going to be key score.

136
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:30,820
Right.

137
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,120
And we are going to say F score string is null.

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,050
If it is empty, if there is nothing there, it means that the score high is going to be equal to zero

139
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,730
else.

140
00:09:48,090 --> 00:10:00,080
Else our score high score high is going to be equal to where is the score high coming from, let's click

141
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,400
on it.

142
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,250
Yes, it is coming from there, so we should be good.

143
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,460
So otherwise, where is our.

144
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,990
No game, where are we?

145
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:18,750
We are here, we are here, otherwise the score high is going to be let's grab the pass and function,

146
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,830
right?

147
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,270
And it is going to convert.

148
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,120
It is going to give us when we pass in a string, it is going to convert it to a number and that is

149
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,070
going to be the score strength.

150
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,330
Perfect.

151
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,700
So we are done with that as well.

152
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,020
Next up, I want to go to my create bricks, whereas I will create bricks function.

153
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,080
Um.

154
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,620
Create it, break color word, oh, there we go.

155
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,120
So inside the create bricks function, I would like to create our text the size of our text that we

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,030
are going to show by the text, I mean this that we have here.

157
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:15,700
So this is going to be like based on the height of the bricks that we have and I'm going to say text

158
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,800
size.

159
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,360
Now, the text size that we have declared there is going to be the height of the row times, the margin

160
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,480
that we have times zero point four or five.

161
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,180
This is going to be the height of our text.

162
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,920
And now it is time for us to go ahead and actually draw our text, so on top of the drop ball, I'm

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,520
going to call a function, draw a text.

164
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,490
I'm not going to save anything because it might throw an error.

165
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,910
And for that's it.

166
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,390
Well, and it is going to keep throwing that on.

167
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,210
My computer is going to overwork itself.

168
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,960
Perfect, so let's go ahead and let's actually draw our text, create the variables, the dimensions,

169
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,830
there is going to be a lot of things that we need to do there for for our text to really work.

170
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:17,600
So what I'm what I am going to do is I'm going to go let's see where I want to put the draw text.

171
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,890
So where is our draw parallels?

172
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,570
So let's collapse this one.

173
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,230
This one.

174
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,280
This is a redraw panel and I want to put it there on top of the draw walls.

175
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,850
So let's copy that and let's put it here.

176
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,920
And I'm going to say draw.

177
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,940
Text, so let's go ahead and let's create that function, draw text.

178
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,650
Yes, we have called it they're perfect, so in here, what I would like to do is first I want to grab

179
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,250
our canvas context and I want to say Phil style.

180
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:04,640
Phil style, and we are going to set it to the color of the text that we have and then let's create

181
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,360
the dimensions perfect.

182
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:17,330
So we are going to have a label size Soulet label size is going to be equal to a derivative of our text

183
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:17,840
size.

184
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,180
So there's going to be time zero point five.

185
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,480
We are going to have a margin, which is going to be four times the wall, times two.

186
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,550
That is the margin.

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:37,790
We are going to have a maximum with a lot for our text, and that is going to be the width of the canvas,

188
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:46,880
minus the margin on each side, which is going to be margin times to then we are going to have a because

189
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,380
we have four columns, one, two, three, four.

190
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,230
We are going to have max widths for each of those columns.

191
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:03,790
So I'm going to say Max with one and this is going to be our Max with time zero point two seven.

192
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:17,060
So this is going to be the width of the width of the first half of the column of text one.

193
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,190
Let's copy it three more times.

194
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,280
And in here, this is going to be two and I'm going to set it to zero point two.

195
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,600
Then we have three this all these are the center of columns, and I'm going to set it to zero point

196
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,380
two as well, and this is going to be four.

197
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,180
And I'm going to set it to zero point two seven zero point two seven is actually correct.

198
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,740
So we have created the withes and now let's create the position.

199
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,840
So we need four positions as well.

200
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,640
So I'm going to say X1 is going to be.

201
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,930
So the first one is going to be the position is going to be the margin.

202
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,270
So it's going to be position.

203
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,210
Of the call them one and let's do this.

204
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,110
So for these second columns position.

205
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,280
I would like to grab our with and I'm going to multiply by zero point four.

206
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,030
So at this point, the width times zero point four at that pixel point is going to be the position of

207
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,930
the second column.

208
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,650
The position of the third column is going to be.

209
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:38,090
With time zero point six, so these two are going to be relatively closer to each other, let's grab

210
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,390
the position number four and position number four is going to be our with minus the margin.

211
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,020
So it's up against the wall on the right.

212
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,300
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a Y label here as well.

213
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:03,040
And that is going to be wall plus the label size, and we are going to create a Y value here as well,

214
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,720
and that is going to be the Y label plus.

215
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,030
Plus, the text size.

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,510
And to and I want to reduce it a little, so I'm just going to multiply it by zero point nine so our

217
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,610
dimensions are done, we are going to go ahead and we are going to say drawing labels.

218
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:39,090
So Conex start phonte the set up the fund first and let's open our tactics, we are going to pass in

219
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,260
a reliable size.

220
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,690
Roman writing.

221
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:55,520
So let's grab our legal size and we need to toss in there the pixel and then let's passan what is the

222
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,570
text font that we have or the font family?

223
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,290
So it is going to be text font.

224
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,800
Right after that, we are going to grab our text line and we are going to set it to left.

225
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,990
And then we are going to grab the full text.

226
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,790
Con.

227
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,819
Phil, text or original text and in the full text.

228
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,940
First off, we need to pass in the text.

229
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,760
So on the left side we have score and let me show it to you.

230
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,290
So here we have score, then we have ball, then we have level, then we have best.

231
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,180
So in this order, we are going to pass in the full text properties here.

232
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:51,760
So first one is going to be text score, this is the text, the position is going to be X1 the after

233
00:17:51,760 --> 00:18:01,510
the position, the Y position is going to be Y label and the width is going to be max with one.

234
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:02,940
Perfect.

235
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,010
So this is going to be the text of the score.

236
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,680
I'm going to copy this one more time.

237
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,280
And I'm going to copy this one one more time, so then we should provide them with the center.

238
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,540
So in the center we have our lives or ball and then we have our live level.

239
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,270
All right.

240
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,930
So here I need to pass and text live.

241
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:35,110
Perfect, so the position is going to be x2 and the width is going to be matched with two.

242
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:41,730
This is going to be three and the position is going to be X three, x two.

243
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,490
And this is going to be.

244
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,640
Text level.

245
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,190
Perfect, and for the last time, I'm just going to grab that, put it right here, and this is going

246
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,490
to be for this to the right and this is the best text score high.

247
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:12,820
Text, I'm just going to say hi, perfect, and this is going to be four, so now these are our text.

248
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,820
So if I save that, have we call the draw text?

249
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,730
And so there we go.

250
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,760
This is our text score board level and best.

251
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,490
Now let's draw the values as well.

252
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:31,360
So before actually going out of the function, we are going to say drawing the values.

253
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,290
I'm just going to say, drawing values, we don't know what the values are.

254
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,940
So first off, it's you know what?

255
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,820
It's actually going to be very similar to this one.

256
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,640
So I'm just going to grab it and put it here.

257
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:52,330
So for the text, we are going to have text size and then the font is going to be the same thing.

258
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,010
The alignment for the first one is left for the second and third one.

259
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,410
It is going to be center for the fourth one.

260
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,580
It is going to be right.

261
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,640
Then we are going to have X1 and then x2, x3 and X four.

262
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,980
This is no longer Y label.

263
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,760
So this is going to be Y value perfect.

264
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,980
The max widths are going to be the same as well and we need to change this text.

265
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:24,370
So for the first one it is going to say score, this is going to be the text of the score.

266
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:32,320
For the second one, we are going to grab our tactics and I'm going to grab the dollar sign and curly

267
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,890
braces.

268
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:41,530
So we have our number of lives that we have and then we have the the remaining lives are here.

269
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,970
The maximum number of lives that we have is going to be here.

270
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,230
So Max Lives is like this.

271
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,270
So this is remaining lives.

272
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,480
This is the maximum lives that that you can have.

273
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,670
For the level we are just going to pass some level now, this level is going to be zero and then one

274
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,920
and then two and then three.

275
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,120
So this is going to change dynamically.

276
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,470
And for the for this, we are going to pass in the score high.

277
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,490
So let's save that and let's come here.

278
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,040
There we go.

279
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,930
So whenever we start the game, you can see that we have three out of three balls.

280
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,880
The level is zero.

281
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,680
The best is zero.

282
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,510
Everything is zero.

283
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:31,980
But if I were to go to our new game, set the score like I know this is this is not going to be like

284
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,510
very practical, but I just want to show you, you can see the score is one hundred and the level is

285
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,990
five.

286
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,150
Perfect.

287
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,410
So let's reset them back.

288
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,270
Now that that is done, let's see what else do we want to do?

289
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,770
I'm going to go to our cruciate bricks function.

290
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,480
So where is that where it should be towards the top, if I remember correctly.

291
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,020
So draw bricks, create bricks, function.

292
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:08,180
And in here, I want to grab our score and I want to provide it here as well, so the score, whenever

293
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,200
the user hits the green, we are going to have score of one.

294
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,460
When it when it goes up one rank, we are going to add two to it.

295
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,210
So it's going to be one three and then this is five.

296
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,360
And I think the red one is going to be seven.

297
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,110
So let's see where we would like to provide this.

298
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,680
So this is our rank.

299
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:34,130
So right below there, I'm going to write a score and the score is going to be based on the rank high

300
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:40,130
minus the rank, and it is going to be two.

301
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,850
And then we are going to add one to it because we are going one level up.

302
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:52,490
When the user hits each of the upper ranks, we are going to add like two scores to that, two consecutive

303
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,480
scores to that.

304
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,550
All right, that is done as well.

305
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,620
The next thing that I would like to do is let's go into our update Brooks function.

306
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,710
So where is our update?

307
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,850
I'm just going to close this for now.

308
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,120
This is the new ball.

309
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,520
This is the new game.

310
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,770
This is the new level of date breaks.

311
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,130
And I am going to you know what?

312
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,210
Now I'm going to leave it there for you.

313
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,610
Update.

314
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,000
This is our update.

315
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Bricks function.

316
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,650
So inside this function right after that, I would like to call a method that is going to be update

317
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,000
score.

318
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,930
And inside there, we are going to pass in our bricks, each of each of individual bricks, individual

319
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,450
bricks is core, right?

320
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,020
And.

321
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:53,060
And then let's go ahead and let's create this, so where should we put it?

322
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,410
So we have our update panel right here and right below the update panel.

323
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,080
I'm going to create our update score function.

324
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,660
So score.

325
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:15,100
Now, this function is going to accept a parameter, so we are going to set up a date score and it is

326
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,830
going to call it the break score.

327
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,090
Right.

328
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,210
So first off, what we would like to do is we would like to add on to the score that we have by the

329
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,830
BRICS score and then we are going to check.

330
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,350
Check for a high score.

331
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:42,600
Now, f score is greater than score high.

332
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,810
What is it that we want to do now?

333
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,470
You remember that we have grabbed an item from the local storage.

334
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,310
And we did not actually set an item to local storage.

335
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,130
This is where we will sit at the item to local storage.

336
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:06,160
So if the score is greater than the high score, it means that we have another high score.

337
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,180
So the high score is going to be equal to that score that we have.

338
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,390
Just have we have just scored right or right and we are going to grab our local storage.

339
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,330
Locals, come on.

340
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,390
Local storage, and we are going to say set item.

341
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:34,150
The items are going to require a case for which we have, which is the key score and the value is going

342
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,800
to be the score high.

343
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,660
All right, so let's save that as well, and what I'm going to do is let's go to our out of bounds function.

344
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,470
And I told you that I think I told you that in here what we are going to do is we're basically testing.

345
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,390
So this was basically a test.

346
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,340
This is not we do want our new game to run.

347
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,790
Right.

348
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,370
But we don't want it to run like this.

349
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:11,380
Whenever I would out of my function is going to call whenever the ball hits the brake and we cannot

350
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,990
get it and it is going to go down, then the out-of-band function function is going to be cut.

351
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,040
Right.

352
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,030
So what I would like to do here, as in the out of bounds function.

353
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:29,460
I'm going to say first stuff, when when it is out of the band, I'm going to reduce it by one life

354
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:38,640
and then we are going to say if lives is equal to zero, it means we don't have any more lives.

355
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,010
That means that the game is over.

356
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,250
Right.

357
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,300
So game over is going to be true.

358
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,030
And finally.

359
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,860
Game over is true, and finally, we are going to call the new ball function here.

360
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,730
So what I would like to do now is go ahead on this, test it.

361
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,260
comScore says, and not a number.

362
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,570
OK, so.

363
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:24,260
Where is our score, where have we specified that the score said dimension's pinball?

364
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm just going to collapse these functions that we are not going to need?

365
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,310
Serve all of that one as well.

366
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,970
So this this this this one as well.

367
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,960
So in here, this is where we are updating your bricks.

368
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,520
And this is the update score and this is somehow it is it's returning now and this update breaks.

369
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:04,890
So let's go to top to or create bricks, because the score is actually coming from our brick class and

370
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,630
the score is right here and we have passed it inside the constructor as well.

371
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,850
But as far as calling this is concerned, there we go.

372
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,250
We can see that we don't have any score.

373
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,460
So whenever when we created the score right here, we need to pass it here as well.

374
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,380
I'm going to pass and the speed mult as well.

375
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,560
So in case we don't have any problems with that.

376
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,270
So let's try this one more time.

377
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,270
So there we go.

378
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,010
You can see that the score is one and the best is one.

379
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,400
The score is going to be two.

380
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,230
I'm going to play it for a while.

381
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,810
All right, so there we go.

382
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,610
And.

383
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,490
Why is the angle so extreme?

384
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:53,650
I think we put it, too, that this is random, so you can see that our score is we just lost the ball.

385
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:00,610
The ball is the score of the ball is reduced, the number of the balls is reduced and the score is for

386
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,050
the best.

387
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,760
As for if I reload the page, this score is going to come from the local stories.

388
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,390
That's why it doesn't matter if you refresh, it is going to stay there.

389
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,490
So let me just check the ball speed and the angle.

390
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,090
So let's go.

391
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:21,880
There we have the ball speed is zero point the zero point four or five ball spin.

392
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,800
Let's just increase it to zero point seven.

393
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,230
So now you know what?

394
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,090
I'm not going to increase it because it should increase, I think.

395
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,070
Did we do the speed as well, the speed increment?

396
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,490
I don't think we have done that.

397
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm not sure about that.

398
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,120
I don't remember.

399
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,080
So let's check it.

400
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,780
A fly ball speed.

401
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,050
Yeah, we did that.

402
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,450
So the speed should be increasing.

403
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,100
As well.

404
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:57,710
So so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to check it, so our score is three, best is four.

405
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:04,370
If the score is above the high score, like right here, then the high score is going to be equal to

406
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,660
the score and it is going to be committed to local storage.

407
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,010
That's what we did.

408
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,520
So the higher ranks, there we go, they have a higher score.

409
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,490
So we have a score of 19.

410
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,120
This is going to be 20.

411
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,840
And this is going to be 21.

412
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,710
So let's see.

413
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,820
This one is 26, so that was five.

414
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,980
This should be three.

415
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,900
Yes, the other one should be seven.

416
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,300
So the red one has to be seven.

417
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,590
I'm just going to keep playing until we hit the red one.

418
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,790
I could increase the speed.

419
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,090
But we are we are getting close.

420
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,630
So you can see how the best score is also changing, so hopefully we are going to hit an orange.

421
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,730
We have done that.

422
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,900
So let's go ahead and let's wait.

423
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,730
There we go.

424
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,120
It didn't.

425
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:27,670
OK, so the best score is 60 and we are getting closer, so we don't have to wait for a long maybe like

426
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:32,670
in the next minute or so, we should hit a red one as well.

427
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,580
There go, come on.

428
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,920
So, uh.

429
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,540
Let's wait for it.

430
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,290
We are getting closer, I know.

431
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,220
Just bear with me.

432
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,680
I just want to check what is the score?

433
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,940
It should be seven, because that's the logic that we have implemented in order.

434
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,010
And I told you that you have to check it.

435
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,560
It's there is no other way.

436
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,700
You got to, like, go ahead and check this to make sure that it is working properly.

437
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,980
I mean, this is just a small game.

438
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:26,150
Like if it were like a bigger one, like like a really huge game, like 3D game, then that would have

439
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,940
taken longer.

440
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,350
This is just like a very basic, simple 2D game.

441
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:40,380
So the next time it bounces up there, we should hit a red one or this way.

442
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,380
So it should we should hit.

443
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,550
That so let's see now, um.

444
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,930
OK, it didn't.

445
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,840
Hopefully this time we are going to hit one.

446
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,320
So there we go.

447
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,190
Oh, it didn't.

448
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:12,370
So we are going to keep track of our score from this point onwards, 146 159 and.

449
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,790
165, come on.

450
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,410
There we go, 172, so it is going to increase, each rank is going to be increased by two.

451
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:40,990
And I think this is going to be it for the for this lecture and see you guys in the next one.
