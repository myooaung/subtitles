Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.450
In this next year, we are going to simulate errors.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.170
All right, so.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.230
I'm just going to copy this comment and I'm going to put it right here.

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.170
So the first kind of error is going to be our input error.

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.450
First off, I'm going to be creating both of the functions and I'm going to showing you I'm going to

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.840
be showing you how these errors are created.

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.350
And whenever you know how the error is created, you will be able to understand how you can debug it.

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.310
All right.

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.050
So we can say function.

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.390
So what is the function name invalid now?

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.190
It was input, input, input, error.

13
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.750
There is not going to be any parameter.

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.630
So for the input, error is simple.

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.760
Whenever we click and there is nothing, we just want to show this message for like a couple of seconds

16
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.710
or something like that.

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.820
So let's grab this diff.

18
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.710
So this diff has an input type of error class.

19
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.630
So I'm going to say document dot, query selector.

20
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.530
Keep in mind I'm not storing the results anywhere.

21
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.730
I'm just going to do something whenever I grab that and I'm going to say that class.

22
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.010
Let's start at what is the class that I want to add that's show class, which has display block.

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.030
All right.

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.300
So I'm going to show it.

25
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.290
Let's save it.

26
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.640
It's come in here.

27
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.750
Let's click please fill out all the all the input fields.

28
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.060
But now the error is not going away if the user should be able to fill something.

29
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.470
So we are going to say sit time out.

30
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.590
And there we go, our favorite Arab function, and we are going to select it once more.

31
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.900
I mean, you could store it inside a variable and then say dot, dot, dot at show and then dot remove

32
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.300
show.

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.600
So after exactly

34
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.670
twenty five hundred or two and a half seconds, I want to remove that or so enter.

35
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.720
Boom goes away.

36
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.520
So if I say AFN, we are still going to get our air, we need to simulate all the possible outcomes.

37
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.760
So there are no surprises when this application is ready for production.

38
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.530
Perfect, but if I say 1000, we get the results perfect, so this is OK, this is done.

39
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.420
We are done with our first input error.

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.100
This error was simpler than the one that we are going to do here.

41
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.830
So let's create our and then next, exciting function, invalid code, no parameters.

42
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.760
So when the code is invalid, we want to show this right.

43
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.550
So it's basically going to be almost the same.

44
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.620
So I'm going to copy this code and I'm going to put it here.

45
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.060
But the class name is Invalid Code, so let's grab that.

46
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.020
Let's put it right here.

47
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.300
And now I'm going to change the time and to one one and a half seconds.

48
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.790
So if I say F, you can see that's an incorrect currency code USD 1000.

49
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:22.510
Invalid currency cut, so let's do this, zoom out a little bit, and if I say offend and they just

50
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.600
then just the U.S. invalid currency.

51
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.320
Now you can see we have two types of errors here.

52
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.240
I'm going to show you what I mean exactly by that.

53
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:42.430
So for this catch now, keep in mind, this is going to give us errors for this part and this catch

54
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.040
is going to give us errors for this part.

55
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.310
So if I have an error, for example, here, we should be able to catch it.

56
00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:00.300
Right here, so I'm just going to catch I'm going to say console the lock error and let's pass error

57
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.790
here.

58
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.500
And error dot message.

59
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.560
Message, let's save it.

60
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.100
So if I say if and and say us, hopefully we will be able to catch it.

61
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.190
You can see that we got that it says valid currency code, where is the error message?

62
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.700
We got something there and it went away.

63
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.190
Let's just log the error itself.

64
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.420
OK, and we are not calling that here, right, but we are, but the reason that it's being called is

65
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.820
is inside our convert currency.

66
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.290
We get our exchange rate.

67
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.600
We call that in there.

68
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.570
Right.

69
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.740
So if I say throw new error, like.

70
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.570
Our

71
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.620
first input just going to say first input, okey doke.

72
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:11.110
So so if I say A.F. USD and 1000 and if I save it, you can see that it says first input because this

73
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.090
this is incorrect.

74
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.240
It throws that error.

75
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.900
Right.

76
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.080
And that error is coming from here.

77
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.480
Of course, we are catching it here.

78
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.490
Now, this catch, it is going to catch this error and any other errors.

79
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.570
And we know how this works because because of promise training, when we train our promises or our dud

80
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.500
then is the one catch.

81
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.390
It is going to catch all the errors.

82
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.760
Right.

83
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.350
But if I say one, two, three here or.

84
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.840
Yeah, yeah.

85
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.400
We just want one, two, three.

86
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.580
And if I say AAF, USD, both of the errors are going to fire.

87
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.940
Right.

88
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.340
You can see that we get one, two, three.

89
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.190
The reason for that is the reason that we are not getting we are not getting this error is because we

90
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.400
just catch we just caught it here.

91
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:09.670
So if I were to say error, I hope you're getting what I'm saying error, error dot message, then we

92
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.280
are going to get that message as well.

93
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.100
So message and error, that message was put in a comma and uh.

94
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.010
Hmm hmm.

95
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.070
Hmm.

96
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.280
That's yep.

97
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:35.810
So if I say AAF and use 1000, we should be able to get both of the errors, you can see that this is

98
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.630
the thing that's cool about it.

99
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.450
So if we catch it, it is going to catch both of the errors.

100
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.700
That's what this catch is going to do.

101
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.890
It's going to catch this error and this error, which is coming from here.

102
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:58.370
So if I come in this one out and if I save it and if I do offend U.S. and 1000 and let's save it, you

103
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:05.990
can see that it says not a number because this is not a number and it's not catching it because we did

104
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.770
not throw it.

105
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.380
When when you don't throw it, it is not going to catch it.

106
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:21.740
If I say A and if I say USD and if I say 1000, 10000, it again, it is going to say not a number.

107
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.850
Right, because the exchange rate is not a number and this error is coming from here.

108
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.270
This exchange rate is and has to be a number.

109
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.950
That's what we checked for.

110
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.260
And this shows my point.

111
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.810
This one, two, three is coming from this catch.

112
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.570
This error is coming from here.

113
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.440
OK, so I'm just going to throw it one more time.

114
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:47.590
So even if I say A.F. USD 1000, we're going to see that same error.

115
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.290
And you can see that we get both of the areas where that error is coming from.

116
00:07:52.910 --> 00:08:02.120
But if I say if and and then I say U.S. and Kleck, you can see that this is the second iteration.

117
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.680
Click, we get the same.

118
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.960
That's the good thing about this catch.

119
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.520
It catches all the errors.

120
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.380
So and here we are going to call our invalid code and we are going to remove this.

121
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:21.440
And in here we are going to call our invalid code.

122
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.990
So I think we are done with simulating this error.

123
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.890
I just wanted to show you different combinations and what actually is happening here.

124
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.850
Right.

125
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:40.140
And if I say a F USD and 1000, we get invalid currency code.

126
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:48.330
If I say a F and and remove this D and say right and valid currency code and if I do D and click, we

127
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.900
get that.

128
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.190
So with this, our application comes to an end.

129
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.340
I hope you have enjoyed it.

130
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.590
Certainly it was a bigger one than the rest, but we are diving into bigger applications.

131
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.520
The next one is going to be the Guardian news.

132
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.950
Very, very cool.

133
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:03.740
All right.

134
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.210
So that's it for this lecture.

135
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.870
And see you guys in the next one.
