00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:08,080
Hi, everyone, in this natural working to create the clear superhero input's function.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:18,620
All right, so before diving into that, I need to clean this code up a little and we created this in

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,830
the previous lecture and time ran out.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:28,340
And now what we what we have to do is we have created this list container, but we need to find a parent

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:28,620
for it.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,850
That's why we selected less data.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,590
So I'm going to say less data dot append child.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,260
What is the child that's going to be the list container, let's say.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,140
Let's actually check that these actually works for Superman D.C. Fly.

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:52,010
Now, you can see that this has been created and now this superhero list class, if you go inside the

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,340
prototype, it has an ad superhero entry and now you can see that underneath the hood.

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,010
It's actually those prototypes are just the syntactic sugar sprayed on top of the prototypes.

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,260
Think of it like that.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,220
Right.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,990
But there was a problem here.

16
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,030
Whenever we are in the Superman, they're still here, but we need to clear that.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,380
Right.

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,040
So that is the function that we are going to create now.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
So I'm going to go ahead.

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,180
I'm going to I'm going to keep that there.

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:30,680
Now we are going to see less that the next method is going to be clear superhero in pets.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,530
And I don't think there is not going to be any parameter here.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,930
So let's go on top and let's create this function.

24
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,920
So that's common.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,070
This one as well at Super Hero.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:55,130
And in here we are going to say real clear superhero in feels just clear them.

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,690
Now, what is the function name.

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,740
The function name is this and what is this going to do?

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,900
This function is going to do very, very a very, very simple thing.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,270
And we are going to use, again, the structuring for that.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
How cool is that?

32
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,140
Very new features, so we are going to say document dot, query selector.

33
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,940
And we are going to grab the name.

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,360
That value, so what it is that I'm trying to do here, so we are going to grab this element once more,

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,360
grab it in here once more, grab it in here once more, and we are going to say that value and we are

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,120
going to set it to an empty to an empty string.

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,070
All right.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,850
So that's basically what I am trying to do here.

39
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,340
All right.

40
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,260
Put it there.

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,700
And this is Univers.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,920
And we are going to put it here as well, and this time this is going to be power and for all three

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,060
of them, we are just going to put empty strings when they when we call this function, oops.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,670
When we call this function, we just want to clear that.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,590
Right.

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,780
So let's go ahead and let's check it out.

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,420
So Superman D.C. fly.

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,580
When I say that, you can see that they have been added there, but they have they have also been removed

49
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,150
from here.

50
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:28,060
So if I come here inside the Proteau, you can see that it's just class when we created it, but actually

51
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,650
it's an object.

52
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,240
So what is the Proteau saying?

53
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,200
It's an object.

54
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,290
That's why it's called object oriented.

55
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,090
Now you can see that the second method that we have added is, is this ad of the second one is clear

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,290
superhero inputs.

57
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,150
Right.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,640
So we were successfully, successfully able to do that.

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,050
And with this our election comes a lecture comes to an end.

60
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,910
And I really hope that you'll like this kind of approach.

61
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:05,860
I may never like I may not repeat it for the for the next lecturer's sorry for the next projects, because

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,150
those projects are going to be there are crucial.

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,560
All of the projects are crucial.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,670
But because this is a different paradigm that we are doing, I just want to make sure that you master

65
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,890
object oriented programming in the first.

66
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:31,380
Project that you do it and I'm just going to come here and I'm going to say form submission, event

67
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,580
listner.

68
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,350
All right, so that's it for this year.

69
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,940
See you guys in the next one.
