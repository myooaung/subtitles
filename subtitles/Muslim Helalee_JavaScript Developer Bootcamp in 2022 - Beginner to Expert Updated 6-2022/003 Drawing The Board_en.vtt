00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.240
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we will draw the board.

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.400
All right, so the board is going to be drawn dynamically, but before actually doing that, let's go

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060
ahead and let's select the elements that we will be working with.

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.370
So first off, I'm going to grab all of our boxes and I'm going to store it within this variable.

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.430
And because there is more than one, we are going to say query selector.

6
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.470
All right.

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.370
And all of them have a class of boxes.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.510
Now, this is going to return to us an e-mail collection, but we need an array.

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:50.250
So we are going to say CONSED boxes array and we are going to say array, dot from and then pass in

10
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.230
the variable name.

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.030
And this is going to convert that variable into an array.

12
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.780
Now let's go ahead and let's grab the result, which is the H1.

13
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.950
So document.

14
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.730
That query selector, right, and use it using the name each one.

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.940
And then finally, we are going to grab our reset button or restart.

16
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.450
So document that query selector.

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.710
But now keep in mind that in a real world application, this is not a good practice to you, select

18
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.890
your elements using their class as use, using their element names.

19
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.020
The reason for that is you will, of course, with any website, you're just going to have one, each

20
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.300
one.

21
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.960
But there is a high chance of having more than one.

22
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.610
But so it's better to just give it the give them a class like this.

23
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.300
So I'm just going to give it a class and I'm going to say a reset button and I'm going to save that.

24
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.820
Let's copy the class.

25
00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.510
So just to follow good coding practices and within these brackets, within these quotes, you can do

26
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.810
any valid cyesis select selector.

27
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.080
And for our H1, we are going to say I'm just going to give it a class of results.

28
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.490
Now you can do a class and or I.D. It doesn't really matter which when you use.

29
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.690
And there is actually no like upside to one rather than the other.

30
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.480
It is just a matter of preference, whichever you want.

31
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.750
Some people really like the idea of the idea of IDs and they use IDs all over their jobs.

32
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.020
But I personally do not agree with that.

33
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.120
In my opinion, you should be able to use whichever whatever it is that you want when it comes to Estima.

34
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.610
So you can grab the class, you can grab the ID, you can grab any attribute of that specific element

35
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.490
that you want to work with after that.

36
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.550
What I would like to do is I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to create some game parameters, parameters,

37
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:12.200
and we're going to have our player one and we are going to denoted as O Capital O, and then we are

38
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.700
going to have our player to denote denoted as Capital X..

39
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.220
Now, this could be anything, right?

40
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.690
And then we are going to select players turn now.

41
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.980
The player's turn is going to be the players, the first player.

42
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.010
We are going to change this, so don't worry about it.

43
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.620
Now, after that, what I would like to do is in here we have spaces now I could use like spaces, the

44
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.380
name spaces, or I could do like choices.

45
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.650
I think choices makes more sense.

46
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.540
So I'm going to initialize the choices.

47
00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.220
These choices, all of the choices with an empty array and then let's go ahead and let's create the

48
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.510
function that is going to draw the board.

49
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.820
Now, the way that this board is drawn is very simple.

50
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.350
We have nine items here.

51
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.490
And knowing that this is actually an array, we know arrays are zero based indices.

52
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.709
So the first one is zero index.

53
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.830
The index is zero one, two, then three, four, five and five, six, seven and eight.

54
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.820
So based on this, we will be able to draw the board.

55
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.290
And where will I like to call?

56
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.370
This is on top here.

57
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.320
Right, so now let's go ahead and let's actually draw that so we are going to grab our boxes and for

58
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:52.860
each of them we are going to grab the box, each individual box and the index for that individual box

59
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.780
and then let's send a callback.

60
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.600
So what do we want to draw?

61
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.090
We want to draw a border.

62
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.420
So let's initialize it with an empty string.

63
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.570
And then we say, if now keep in mind if.

64
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.690
So if I come here, if the index is less than three, what does it mean?

65
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.720
It means we are talking about the first row, so the first row has index of zero one and two.

66
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.560
So they are less than three, right?

67
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.950
If they are less than three.

68
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.520
We draw a border bottom for them.

69
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.690
Right.

70
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.480
So let's go ahead and let's actually do that.

71
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:41.110
F index is less than three, it means that we are talking about the top row, then we want to grab the

72
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.750
border and add onto it.

73
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.910
Keep in mind, we do not want to override it.

74
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.050
We want to add other we want to be able to add other borders as well.

75
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.030
So if you just provide this and you override this with this border, then this border is going to go

76
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.190
away and this one will be remaining, which we do not want.

77
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.410
Now let's grab our border bottom property from C assess.

78
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.630
I want it to be two pixels solid and the color should be white.

79
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.750
And then let's just ended with a semicolon and let's say that it's come here.

80
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.790
We don't have we don't have our border yet.

81
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.980
And the reason for that is we need to assign it to this.

82
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.080
We need to assign it to the box.

83
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.270
So we are going to say box.

84
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.540
That style should be equal to border.

85
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.670
Now we should see something.

86
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.190
There we go.

87
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.680
So this is our first border.

88
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:46.150
I'm going to create them step by step so you can really understand what's going on in here.

89
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.810
What I would like to do is I would like to use a modulus operator with which, to be honest, I'm not

90
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.240
sure if we have covered.

91
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.580
And it doesn't matter because I will be explaining this.

92
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:05.110
The modulus operator is going to give us the the remainder of a division operation.

93
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.860
Right.

94
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:14.230
For example, if you divide ten by five, the modulus operator, the remainder of that is going to be

95
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.650
zero.

96
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.070
Right, because ten is completely divisible by five or by two.

97
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.680
So you can divide by that.

98
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.870
Now, we say that if the index divided by three equals zero, it means the remainder is zero.

99
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.830
What it is that we want first off, let's assess where we are talking about.

100
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:46.630
So where it is that the index is divisible by by something solid by three and the remainder is going

101
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.190
to be zero.

102
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.860
So what can be divided by three four from which we can get a zero remainder.

103
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.730
So it could be either three or six.

104
00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.630
Right.

105
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.190
Or zero.

106
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.580
So we can get zero zero divided by three.

107
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.030
We are going to get zero for the remainder three.

108
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.010
This is this is three right here where the cursor is three divided by three.

109
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.090
We are going to get zero as a remainder and then we have six.

110
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.730
So zero three and six.

111
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.170
So basically we are talking about this first vertical column.

112
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.960
Of course, columns are vertical.

113
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.470
So this first column for the first column, we need a border.

114
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.010
Right.

115
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.330
So we are going to say board.

116
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.230
You know what?

117
00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:40.059
I'm just going to go ahead and copy that and I'm going to paste right here and I'm going to change this

118
00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.470
bottom to right.

119
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.059
Let's save it now.

120
00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.230
We should see a border.

121
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.880
There we go.

122
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.040
So this is the border that we just create now.

123
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:56.540
For us to create this ball left, we need to do this basically the same thing, but with a little bit

124
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.160
of difference.

125
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:06.620
Now, if the remainder of that division is too, it means that we are either selecting to five or eight.

126
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.360
Right.

127
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:14.350
You could go ahead and grab a piece of paper and a pencil and you can do the division.

128
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.580
I'm just going to go ahead and say, if it is to, then I want this border to be applied to left.

129
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.390
And you can see that we have this, the only border that we need to create is this one.

130
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.410
So for that, I'm going to grab the last item.

131
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:36.010
So item six, item seven and item eight, which all three of them are greater than five.

132
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.330
So I'm going to say it's copy that if index.

133
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:47.250
Is greater than five, it mean it is six, seven, and there are only three possibilities we want to

134
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.530
add to the border, we want to add to the border a border of top.

135
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.230
Let's save it.

136
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:53.940
That's come here.

137
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.810
There we go.

138
00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:01.360
Our border is perfectly fine and we were able to actually draw the border.

139
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.300
Now, this was fun, right?

140
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.640
We haven't done anything using JavaScript.

141
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:14.670
What we have drawn, we haven't drawn like using like success in this manner that just taken into account

142
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:20.330
the indices and doing the math and just drawing the borders dynamically.

143
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.450
So with this, our lecture comes in and see you guys in the next one.
