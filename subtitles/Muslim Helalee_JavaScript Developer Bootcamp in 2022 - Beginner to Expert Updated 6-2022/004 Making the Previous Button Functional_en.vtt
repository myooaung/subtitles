00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.080
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.350
In this next year, we are going to grab our previous button and we are going to make it functional.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.330
Oh, right now, this part I was supposed to cover in the previous lecture, but it got very long,

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.590
so I just postponed it to this lecture and we're going to dedicate an entire lecture to it as well.

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.730
So the way that this works is going to be very, very, very similar to our next button.

6
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.330
All right.

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.760
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and.

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.320
All right.

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.100
So what what what what is it that we want to do?

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.230
So whenever we click on the next button, we should be able to click on the previous button as well.

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.080
But what?

12
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.010
We can do it.

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.390
All right.

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.000
So let's go ahead and let's accomplish that.

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.810
So in here, Ron, I'm going to do is first off, I'm going to grab our previous meeting and I'm going

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.500
to add an event listener to it.

17
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.629
We are going to listen for a click by the Browse by the user, and then we are going to run a function,

18
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.050
write.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.150
And in the function, what I'm going to do as first off, I want to know what the current images, so

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.210
I'm just going to grab that from there and I'm going to post it here.

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.860
And then when I know what the current images image is, I want to grab the previous element sibling

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.160
of the current image, because this is the the previous button.

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:39.420
And whenever I click on the previous button, I want the current image to be switched by the previous

24
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.440
image, right.

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.380
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say const.

26
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.920
And instead of calling it the next image, I'm just going to call it a previous image.

27
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.280
And for this, we are going to grab the current image and we are going to say previous elements of link,

28
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.730
and that's how simple it is.

29
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.740
All right, so the and the final thing that I want to grab is I want to grab the index for the previous

30
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.450
image as well.

31
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.100
So it's going to be previous index and we are going to go into our images and from there we are going

32
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.100
to apply a method which is find the index.

33
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.790
And when they find the index method, it's called we want to run a function and function from a function

34
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.250
is going to have a parameter of image and the image is going to be equal to the previous image.

35
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.470
So this is the result of this function is going to be in a numeric value because this is a fine index.

36
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.950
It only finds index indices and it provides it to this images and then we can grab it through this previous

37
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.300
index, a constant or variable.

38
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.230
So what I want to do here is I want to go ahead.

39
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.810
Basically, it's the same thing that we did here.

40
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.020
So what I want to do is I want to see a list that style dot transform.

41
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.110
Is going to who is going to be equal to this?

42
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.230
I'm just going to stay right here.

43
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.320
But the difference is that now we are not.

44
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.670
We are not actually actually moving forward right now, and it is not going to be the next image, it

45
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.470
is going to be the previous image.

46
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.360
Right.

47
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.600
And the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab the current image, current image, that class

48
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.300
analyst and I want to remove the current image class.

49
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.090
And I want to add it to the previous image.

50
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.100
So previous image that classless start at.

51
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.000
And I want to say current image.

52
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.090
So whichever image is the previous image, it is going to receive a class of current image.

53
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.650
And in our next button, whichever image which was the next one, received this class.

54
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.160
Right.

55
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.380
So we are just moving backward and that's basically it.

56
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.340
So if I go ahead and if I click on this one, we still can see our image, our error.

57
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.800
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and remove this head in class because we are going

58
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.810
to add a dynamically anyway.

59
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.330
So.

60
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.830
So if I go ahead and if I move forward, I should be able to move backward as well.

61
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.610
So if I go all the way to the end, so this is at the end, we can go all the way to the front as well

62
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.380
with this image.

63
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.130
So each time when we click this, it is going to grab this entire list and it is going to transform

64
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.640
it and transform property's value is going to be the width of this image, which is fifteen, thirty

65
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.080
six.

66
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.570
Now there are still two missing pieces of this puzzle.

67
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.090
The first piece is whenever we click whenever we are on our first image.

68
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.440
We want to remove the previous arrow and whenever we are on our last image.

69
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.550
We want to remove the next error.

70
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.920
All right, so these are the two pieces of the puzzle missing, but we are going to cover them in our

71
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.610
next lecture.

72
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.190
The thing that I want to do here is I just want to decrease the number of lines of code because we have

73
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.700
studied functions in JavaScript and functions.

74
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.030
They allow us to write reusable code.

75
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.980
So what I can do is I can just go ahead and cut these three lines and these three lines and create another

76
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.430
function.

77
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:46.790
So what I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to the top and I'm going to create a move to move

78
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.700
to a IMG function.

79
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.260
All right.

80
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.130
So I'm going to create another function.

81
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.370
And this is going to be a function expression.

82
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.420
We are going to say move to image.

83
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.340
And, um.

84
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.970
All right, and in here, we are going to create a function and we are going to pass in three parameters

85
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.350
and I'm going to tell you why.

86
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.740
So the first parameter is going to be list.

87
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.750
The second parameter is going to be the current image and the third parameter is going to be the next

88
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.160
image.

89
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.420
And in here, what I want to do is I just want to go ahead and cut all of that, just cut it and just

90
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.170
pasted here and let's save it.

91
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.950
And now let's call this move to image inside this next button, because we need to call it to be able

92
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.940
to use that.

93
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.290
And we need to pass in the parameters, so the arguments for those parameters, so the first argument

94
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:48.430
for the list we are going to pass in the list itself for the current image we are going to pass in the

95
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.300
current image and for the next image you are going to pass in the next image.

96
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.740
So now if I save it and if we come here, it still works.

97
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.090
It's all right.

98
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.670
It works, but there is still something missing.

99
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.400
I mean, we cannot call this function inside our previous because we don't have any next image.

100
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.750
All right.

101
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.810
So now this next image part is actually like it's a problem for us.

102
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.200
So we should come up with a way to change this name, to be able to call this function in this previous

103
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.820
button as well, because we have talked about how functions are allow us to write reusable code.

104
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:34.480
So what I am going to do here is instead of writing next image or previous image or instead of creating

105
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.900
a function expression for the next image and creating another function expression for the previous image,

106
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.520
which beats the point of functions, what I can do is I can remove this next image with the target image.

107
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.790
So if I write target image now, target image could be the next image.

108
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.370
It could be the previous image.

109
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.470
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go back and I'm going to grab all the next and I'm going

110
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:07.120
to add I'm going to replace him with target image and I'm going to save and in here we are going to

111
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.270
pass in the next image for that for that target image.

112
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.910
Now, this list argument is going to come and be passed instead of the list.

113
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.060
The current image is going to be passed instead of this current image.

114
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.940
And the next image is next.

115
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.810
Image is value is going to Pastan instead of this target image.

116
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.490
And we are going to get our effect as well.

117
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.930
So if I click on it, we still see that it is working.

118
00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.010
But what if what about the previous image?

119
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.850
So we are going to grab this and we are going to remove everything and we are going to just call this

120
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.330
function.

121
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.970
I'm going to provide a space there and I'm going to provide a space they're now in here, we do have

122
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.640
a list specified because it's right here.

123
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.430
We do have a current image, which is right here, but we don't have any next image.

124
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.180
So instead of next, we are just going to call previews.

125
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.310
And if I click on this, it is going to go it is going to move forward.

126
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.800
And if I click on this, it is going to move backward.

127
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.900
All right.

128
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.670
So now we have successfully used our function as a reusable code.

129
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.360
That's it for this next year.

130
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.100
See you guys in the next one.
