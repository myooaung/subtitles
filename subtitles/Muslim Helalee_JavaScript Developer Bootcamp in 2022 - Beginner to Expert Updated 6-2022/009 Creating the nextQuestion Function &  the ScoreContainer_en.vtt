00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.200
Hi, everyone, in this next year, we're going to create the next question function.

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.340
All right, so I'm going to come here and I'm going to say next question function now, why is this

3
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.480
function important?

4
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.680
It is important because for a few reasons.

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.170
First, whenever you click on an incorrect answer, you should go to the next answer.

6
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.470
Sorry to the next question.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.150
If you click on an incorrect answer answer, you should still be able to go to the next question.

8
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.250
These are the two scenarios.

9
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.600
The third one is whenever you're not able to answer a question and the timer runs, you still should

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.950
go to the next question.

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.610
This is why the next question is very, very important.

12
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.900
So let's go ahead and let's create the next question.

13
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.280
All right.

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.010
And in here, what I'm going to do is, first off, we are going to go ahead and grab our account and

15
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.220
we are going to set it to zero, because whenever we go to the next question, the next question is

16
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.080
where the count is going to be zero.

17
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.730
All right.

18
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.120
And then I'm going to create an if statement and we are going to check if if because the reason that

19
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.480
we create an if statement here is because what if the next question is not there?

20
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.760
What if we don't have any next question, then we want to print out the score, contain the result.

21
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.610
And if we have a next question, we want to go to the next question.

22
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.970
So we are going to grab our active question and we are going to say if the active question is less than

23
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.190
the last question, do what?

24
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.990
Grab the active question and incremented by one.

25
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.500
This is where the active question makes sense.

26
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.570
Right?

27
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.150
And when you incremented by one, do what?

28
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.900
OK, so the active question is incremented by one.

29
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.020
And this function is called next question.

30
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.220
It means that the for example, the last question has an index of nine, yet the active question has

31
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.280
an index of five.

32
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.500
So we still have like four more like five more questions to go.

33
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.840
Right.

34
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.020
That's why we increment the active question by one.

35
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.860
So the active question now has an index of six.

36
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.830
All right.

37
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.070
So when the active question goes to the next question, we should render the question once more the

38
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.790
render the question, the the question function.

39
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.170
Right.

40
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.780
And this is the first function that we created.

41
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.960
So we are going to render this function one more time.

42
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.420
We're going to call this function one more time.

43
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.350
And when we call this function now, the active question has, let's say, an idea of six and this has

44
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.180
a value of six.

45
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.180
And when you provide six here inside the question, it means that inside this questions array, we are

46
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.770
going to grab the sixth item inside there.

47
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.550
And when we grab that sixth item, we are going to change the text to this.

48
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.250
The answer choices are going to be changed to this.

49
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.710
The background image is going to be changed to this.

50
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.160
So each time we render a new quote, we go to the next question.

51
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.660
We should render the question as well, because if we do not render it, there will be no question to

52
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.680
be seen on the page.

53
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.180
So else else basically says if active question is equal to last question or active question is bigger

54
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.350
than the last question.

55
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.890
In that case, it means that we don't have any more questions.

56
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.440
We want to clear our interval, which with the timer that we have created there.

57
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.900
Right.

58
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.990
And when we do that, we also want to render the score.

59
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.610
I know we have not created this function yet, render score, but we are going to create.

60
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.490
So when the if the question if there are still questions, show the question, if there are no questions,

61
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.650
clear the interval and render score.

62
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.970
Just render the score.

63
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.060
Just tell the user how much person to correctly answer.

64
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.029
What are the number of the quirkily?

65
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.980
Answer questions.

66
00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.480
Now this next question, we are going to grab it.

67
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.900
First off, we are going to call it inside the Czech answer.

68
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.810
The reason for this is I'm just going to keep explaining it.

69
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.260
All right.

70
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.850
And I'm sure you're going to get it.

71
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.030
OK, so in here we have an if statement.

72
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.040
All right.

73
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.110
So if the answer is correct, we are going to increment the score and we are going to change the background

74
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.620
to green.

75
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.810
If the answer is incorrect, we are just going to change the background to red.

76
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.210
But it doesn't matter if the score is if the answer is correct or if the answer is incorrect.

77
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.940
We still want to go to the next question.

78
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.450
Right.

79
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.080
So like this, for example, there are four answers.

80
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.640
Even if I click on the incorrect answer, we are going to go to the next question.

81
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.120
If I click on the correct answer, still we are.

82
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.740
To go to the next question so it does not matter whether the answer is incorrect or the answer is correct,

83
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.100
we want to go to the next question.

84
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.820
That's why this next question is called outside this if statement.

85
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.990
All right.

86
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.900
It means that after the chick answer function is evaluate is done with this F statement, it should

87
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.160
go to the next question.

88
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.900
That's very simple.

89
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.500
The next place that we want to call this is the render counter, because whenever we go to the next

90
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.110
question, we want to reset the renter.

91
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.610
Right.

92
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.320
So if the answer of the count is less than the question time, we talked about how we do all this.

93
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.710
But what if the count is what if the answer is incorrect?

94
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:03.500
Or basically what this does is whether what if the user has not entered any any answer?

95
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.060
So, I mean, I'm talking about this functionality that the user is thinking and ten seconds pass.

96
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.570
What about then what do we do then?

97
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.670
We know when ten seconds, seconds pass, we just reset the counter.

98
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.650
But what about the next question?

99
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.200
What about the the renderer question?

100
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.050
What about those?

101
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.830
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come here and we are going to grab this and I'm going to remove

102
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.270
the count equal to zero.

103
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.480
But because the count equals zero is already inside.

104
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.870
Our next question and I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to call our next question.

105
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.930
All right, so whenever the user has not answered the question, we are going to go to the next question,

106
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.420
but there is one more thing that we want to do.

107
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:04.750
So when the user didn't answer the question, we will be going to the next question, but this box will

108
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.260
be read as well.

109
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.240
So we need to call and the answer is incorrect function here as well.

110
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.110
So let's save it.

111
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.070
Let's check out our application.

112
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.870
So close that so I'm not going to answer this question, so I'm not going to answer it and we are going

113
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.630
to wait for it because by our calculation, it should go to the next question.

114
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.040
It did go and it gave us a read.

115
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.730
Right.

116
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.850
So even if you do not attempt and the time passes, you're going to get a read.

117
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.400
But if I when I click on it, we get to the next question.

118
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.440
The count is zero.

119
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.300
We get a green, we get to the next question.

120
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.200
The count starts from zero and we get a green answer incorrect.

121
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.730
We get to the next question.

122
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.500
The count starts to zero, but we get a read here because this says answer is incorrect.

123
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.010
Very simple stuff.

124
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.800
And finally, the only thing left here for us is whenever the user answers all of the questions, either

125
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.660
correctly or incorrectly, we want to render our score.

126
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:17.150
So I'm just going to say render score, render score function, which we have created, which we have

127
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.870
called their.

128
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:24.940
So I'm just going to say to function, render score, all right.

129
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.250
And in here, what do what do I want to do?

130
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.830
I want to grab this core container.

131
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.520
All right.

132
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:41.620
And I want to say style dot visibility should be visible because we have selected our core container

133
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.179
and we have set it to visibility hidden.

134
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.730
Now we want to say it should be visible.

135
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.740
And now when the square container is visible, let's say let's come here.

136
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.050
So let's try to go one plus one negative.

137
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.040
So this should be correct.

138
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.290
This should be incorrect.

139
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.380
This should be correct.

140
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.410
This should be incorrect.

141
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.770
This should be correct.

142
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.420
And this should be incorrect.

143
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.970
So now we are we get to our square container, but there is no message printed here.

144
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.810
We should print a message.

145
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.400
Right.

146
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:24.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to say score percentage and

147
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.630
I'm going to call a score percentage.

148
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.570
And we are going to say math dot round.

149
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.550
So round whatever number you have and do what.

150
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:43.660
So we want this math to to multiply our score by 100 and then divide it by questions.

151
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.420
Were his questions at length?

152
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:56.090
I'm going to explain to you why this so, for example, we have answered seven questions out of 10.

153
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.680
All right.

154
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.500
So the score is seven.

155
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.630
I'm just going to grab my calculator.

156
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.330
What is that?

157
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.260
Count.

158
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.250
Come on, buddy.

159
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.790
Give me a calculator.

160
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:16.110
All right, so we have answered seven questions out of ten, and now we multiply it by 100, we get

161
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.040
700 and then we divide it by questions the length.

162
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.320
So what is the length of the questions?

163
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.360
It is ten.

164
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.220
So let's divide it by 10.

165
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.240
What is the percentage that we get?

166
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.890
It is a simple like.

167
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:37.160
It is a simple mathematical formula in which we just get percentage, and because if I do not multiply

168
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.340
by 100, I just get seven.

169
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.790
And so let's make it zero, we just get seven and we divide it by 10.

170
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.080
We are going to get points seven multiplied by 100.

171
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.290
We are going to get 70.

172
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:56.390
So the person this is how we are going to get our percentage.

173
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.900
Right.

174
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.470
And we can also get the score as well.

175
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:07.840
So in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to I'm going to create two twos inside the score container.

176
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.360
We remember we remember that this core container inside our e-mail is empty.

177
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.790
So these elements, they're going to be dynamic elements.

178
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:23.240
So we are going to grab our core container and we are going to say inner HTML because we are going to

179
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.960
create two.

180
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.310
We are going to add it.

181
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.130
OK, first off, we are just going to create it and the next one will be added.

182
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.690
So let's go with the pack tactics.

183
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:48.270
Let's create our two starting tag and I'm going to say person take off off correctly answered insert

184
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.210
questions.

185
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:59.110
Percentage of the answer questions, and we could just say this, and now let's grab our template strings

186
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.260
and from here I'm just going to call in the score percentage.

187
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.630
And now this is done, of course.

188
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.540
Now, let's go ahead and let's create the ending tech H2.

189
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.720
So everything is done.

190
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.080
Let's take a look at it.

191
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.520
I'm just going to do this.

192
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.090
Just want to get to the end.

193
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.490
So it's a percentage of correctly answered questions is 50.

194
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.780
So let's check it out.

195
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.160
One, two, three, four, five.

196
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.190
Indeed, it is 50 percent because there is 10 questions we have answered five.

197
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.920
That is 50.

198
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.210
The next element that I want to add on now, if I do not say plus, I'm just going to show you what's

199
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:37.920
going to happen.

200
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.730
So no.

201
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:49.380
Number of Kirkley answer questions, we are just going to grab our core variable, save it, let's go

202
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.840
to a very, very quick.

203
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.630
All right, now it says a number of correctly answer questions, where is the percentage?

204
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:07.350
Because we initially we we provided this score container A.T.M. witness to and then we we we ourselves

205
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.500
overrode it, overwrote it with this issue.

206
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.690
But we should append both of them with the plus operator.

207
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.260
All right.

208
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.750
And when I say it now, we are going to get both of them.

209
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:25.650
So I'm just going to go very quickly with says percentage of correctly answer questions, 30 number

210
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.420
of correctly answer questions, 30, because we have one, two, three.

211
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.760
All right, so let's go ahead and let's check it out.

212
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.420
Let's see if every question is accurate.

213
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:47.830
We see our counter works, we see our background image, and we also see that each question relates

214
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.990
to that background image that we have.

215
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:56.220
Baby, we have Wolf Lone wolf, and we have this and we are done.

216
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.510
So this is going to be it for this lecture and for this chapter and for this project.

217
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.730
I really hope that you have learned a lot and you've really enjoyed it because I did.

218
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.490
And this is a wrap up.

219
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.350
So see you guys in the next chapter.
