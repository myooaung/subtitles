00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:08,740
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create the drag leave and drop if listeners.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,850
All right, so we know that whenever we grab our item and when we say drug, enter.

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,940
It is going to change the background color of the container, but whenever we leave the background,

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,080
color still stays the same, which is not something that we want.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,570
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our list and we are going to add another event, listeners,

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,650
and we are going to say drag no.

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,640
When the drug leaves, what do we want to do?

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,280
We want to run a function.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,120
The function is going to run simply one simple thing.

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,230
All right.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,820
And that simple thing is just a background color.

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,830
So we are going to grab our list.

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:02,350
You're going to see a list style dot background color, and we are going to set it to a color now.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,160
The color is going to come from this Cyesis because the reason for that is so originally this is the

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,510
color.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,510
What is this color?

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,980
This color, which is right here.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,780
It is this color at this point, which has the point five at the end of it.

19
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,180
All right.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,320
But whenever we drag our item, the item is entered.

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,140
It changes color to grayish kind of color.

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:30,370
And when it leaves, we want the container containers background color to revert back to its original

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:30,770
color.

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,580
So for that, I'm going to grab the color, which is the original color of that container, and I'm

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,590
going to put it right here.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,380
Let's save it.

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,850
It's come here.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,450
And now when I leave, it is going to change color.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,060
Go leave.

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,210
See, now it changes colors.

31
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,830
All right, so this is done as well.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:59,780
The last thing that we need to do here is that we need to create the drop event listener because all

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,170
of the drug VolitionRx there are completed and the final one accompanying them is going to be the drop

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,610
event listener.

35
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,160
And then the drop you are going to grab our list and we are going to append a child to it.

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,660
And what is the child?

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,960
The child is whichever item is the drug item.

38
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,890
Very cool.

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,280
Right.

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,970
And then and then what we are going to do is whenever we drop it there.

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,910
So you know what?

42
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,230
I'm not going to do anything else.

43
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,330
Let's go ahead and let's see what happens.

44
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,650
So if I drop it here, we can do that, right?

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,850
So we can drop it here.

46
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,020
We can drop it here.

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,040
We can drop it back here, drop it here, drop it here.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,800
So wherever we are dropping, we are actually changing the background colour.

49
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:53,030
So if I were to grab this item number five and drop it in the final container, we change the background

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,450
color.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,800
If I grab the item number two and and bring it over here to container number one and drop it, we are

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,250
changing background color.

53
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,160
OK, this is not something that we want.

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,750
We want whenever the drop event is happened, we want the background color to be to to return to the

55
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,580
same color that we had.

56
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:22,010
So if I were if I were to hover over on any of them, we will be seeing that some valid target spots

57
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,990
that we can drop our item to.

58
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,610
And whenever I drop it, when they drop event happens, we can see that the background to color it reverts

59
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,170
back to its original color.

60
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,250
Right.

61
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,360
And we can do that.

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
We can bring it down.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,550
Bring this one down.

64
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,940
Bring this here.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,160
Here you can do you can bring anything, anywhere that you want.

66
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,680
But in here where it says not allowed, you cannot do it because there is no event there.

67
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:56,520
All right, so with this this project comes to an end, I hope that you guys enjoyed this and I hope

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,010
that you guys learn a lot from this project, even though this was a relatively sure project.

69
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,410
But we covered very, very key concepts of dragging in JavaScript.

70
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,940
That's it for this project and this chapter.

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,620
See you guys in the next one.
