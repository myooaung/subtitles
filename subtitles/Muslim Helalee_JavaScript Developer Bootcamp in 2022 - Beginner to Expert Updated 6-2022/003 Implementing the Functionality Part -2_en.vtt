WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.720
Hi, everyone, in this letter, we are going to complete the functionality of this application.

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.330
All right, so we want to track where exactly is the user typing so we can implement two formulas for

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.740
the other two inputs.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.650
So what are going to do is I'm going to either target is going to give us exactly where the user is

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.910
clicking or where the user is inputting.

6
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.330
And then from there, we're going to grab the name.

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.250
OK, now, before doing this, let's go ahead and cancel it.

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.660
I'm going to I'm doing cancel logs a lot because I'm showing you whenever, for example, I just want

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.750
to say this and we are going to resume this application that whenever you want to create something on

10
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.590
your own and you and it is a dumb and interaction kind of thing.

11
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.780
So the thing that is going to the object that is going to help you like the most is going to be the

12
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.170
object.

13
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.380
So, for example, you want to do something when the user clicks, when the user double clicks, when

14
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.150
the user scrolls, when the user enters and input changes and input.

15
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.030
If these are the kind of events that you're working with or like the drag and drop API and the Web speech

16
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.580
API, we have talked about a lot of APIs like the HTML5 Canvas API.

17
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.900
All of them are APIs.

18
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.150
I've I have I may not have mentioned them like, like exclusively because the API term is is very,

19
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.990
very confusing to beginners.

20
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.770
That's why I, I just wanted to throw it out there, but I didn't expect you to understand it.

21
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.850
What APIs.

22
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.240
Because we are yet to cover APIs and asynchronous JavaScript.

23
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.400
Right.

24
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.120
But these are all APIs as well.

25
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.310
Now, the object that is going to help you a lot is going to be the event object.

26
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.210
Now, the event object is not one object.

27
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.539
The event object is is like directly associated with the kind of event that you're working with or the

28
00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.540
kind of event that you're listening for.

29
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.120
So if you have an input event, the event object is going to give you different information.

30
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.670
If you have like, let's say click, you're going to have different information.

31
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.330
If you say double click, you're going to have different based on that.

32
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.310
If you have a scroll, then you're going to get different information.

33
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.110
Based on that, you can know what it is that you're actually looking for.

34
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.550
So what I'm going to do is we even though we have done this, I want to do it one more time.

35
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.460
So if I click here and if I do one, we can see this event is fire and it says input event.

36
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.320
OK, so this is an input event because we have specified it input and we can see that this event is

37
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.850
clearly different from the, for example, click event that we had in our previous application.

38
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.690
So if I were to, for example, like, let's say Grabau, each one, this is just just for demonstration

39
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.290
purposes.

40
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:18.040
I'm going to say each one document that query selector and I'm going to pass on the element.

41
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
Name each one.

42
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.780
So now I'm going to grab each one and I'm going to say add event listener and we are going to listen

43
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.650
for a click.

44
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.240
But the callback function is not going to do anything.

45
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.510
The callback function is just going to go ahead and log to the console, this event object, which is

46
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.800
associated with the click event.

47
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.650
So if I click on this.

48
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.880
Have we selected it correctly so this is a Twan document, that query selector.

49
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.970
So it is an H1, let's give it a class to be more specific title.

50
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.430
All right.

51
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.080
And let's say here title.

52
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:11.270
OK, so so this is a one, we have selected it and now I'm going to come to Stiles and I'm going to

53
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.839
say cursor pointer so we can see it in action.

54
00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.329
So now when I click on it, we can see that this event is happening.

55
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.810
But this event is completely different than this one.

56
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.270
The input inside the input.

57
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.090
We have an input event, but this is a mouse event.

58
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.810
All right.

59
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.030
We have covered events.

60
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:41.200
We have talked about them, so see this mouse event, it gives us data is composing input type data

61
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.160
transfer.

62
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.760
But the mouse event, it gives a screen egg screen.

63
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.740
Why client X, client Y.

64
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.460
And if I come here, we can see that we have a lot more information for the click event rather than

65
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.300
the input of it.

66
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.250
So or every event has a different event object associated with that specific event.

67
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.350
And in here we can see it's this type of click and it's this type of input.

68
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.660
So for the input, we have no like coordinates like X and Y, whatever that is.

69
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.760
But in the kaleck we can see that we have client X client why we have the Movement X, movement Y,

70
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:29.530
we have offset X, offset Y page, page Y, which we are going to use in our following to applications

71
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.370
these four.

72
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.210
Right.

73
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.950
We have path and all that.

74
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.970
So this is something that I just wanted to show you that these, these they also exist.

75
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.690
Right.

76
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.500
And each event has a different event object based on that event.

77
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.910
So as many events as we have in Dume, those many different objects we can create and all these information

78
00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.000
they are going to give us, like the means to do cool stuff with JavaScript.

79
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.290
So what you can do is like a basic, very basic thing that by now I'm sure you can do it is you can

80
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:15.400
just go ahead and say document that body, that style, that background color.

81
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.630
And you can change it to Rete, so whenever you click on this issue on the background, color of the

82
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.130
body is going to change to red.

83
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.430
So this is a very basic thing.

84
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.130
We have created so far 24 projects.

85
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.970
So in all of them, we have done some sort of dumb interaction.

86
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.810
And through these all these projects, and this is what I want you to do is what I expect you to do

87
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:48.610
is to do like to create to like grab all these segments of these projects and create something meaningful

88
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.350
for you.

89
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.160
All right.

90
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.320
So they're not that difficult, believe.

91
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:59.410
So you just have to think like JavaScript, think like e-mail and think when you develop that mentality,

92
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.910
then everything is going to be OK.

93
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.430
So now we have our event object and we are going to get the target.

94
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.330
And from there we are.

95
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:14.100
OK, this is Q Of course that runs so from the target, we are going to get the value.

96
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.010
So if I come down here we should see the value somewhere.

97
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.470
Where is the value?

98
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.760
O kay Dodds value, so the value, of course, the value, we don't see it here because the value comes

99
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.830
from the input itself.

100
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.530
OK, that's going to be the value that we have passed.

101
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:41.230
So if I come here on top, we have data one, we can grab the data, but we do have a value.

102
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.140
So the value is going to come from the this HTML page itself, because that is the thing that we have

103
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.730
inserted.

104
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.930
So we know.

105
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.110
OK, OK, not the value.

106
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.120
Sorry, we are looking for the name.

107
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.790
So if I just go ahead and reload this page and if I type in one, let's go ahead and let's look for

108
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.060
the target inside the target.

109
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.560
Let's look for name.

110
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.730
All right.

111
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.780
So erm and so name we can see it is Celsius.

112
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:20.390
So if I click here and if I type two and we go to this event into Target, we are going to get a Farenheit.

113
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.080
OK, where is name.

114
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:23.870
This is the name.

115
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.480
Now where is this coming from.

116
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:32.539
It is coming from from our e-mail where we have specified name Farenheit name like Fahrenheit Celsius

117
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.710
and Kelvin so.

118
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:42.690
Long story short, based on the name, we can find out which input it is that the user has is typing

119
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.049
in.

120
00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.650
So we are going to do a series of statements.

121
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.900
We are going to say if input name.

122
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.430
Is equal to what Celsius, what do we want to do?

123
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:02.900
We want to grab the Fahrenheit and put Fahrenheit and put and from there the value and we want to set

124
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.050
the value to the following formula.

125
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.680
So what is the formula?

126
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:13.670
The formula is the input that the user has typed and or the temperature value that the user has entered.

127
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.900
And we are going to multiply it by one point eight plus thirty two.

128
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.130
So this is the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion formula.

129
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.620
OK, so we have successfully converted Celsius to Fahrenheit.

130
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.810
What about Kelvin?

131
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.960
So whenever we want to type inside the Kelvin and but we are going to grab the Kelvin input and from

132
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.570
there we're going to grab the value and we're going to set the value to temperature value, which is

133
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:47.100
the value that the user has survived, and plus two to seventy three point one five.

134
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:56.090
So if I click here and if I type one cannot set property null of undefined at HTML 12.

135
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:07.460
So if we come here Fahrenheit in Fahrenheit and put that value should be temperature, value, whatever,

136
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.920
I think we should complete this, then it is going to work.

137
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.770
So let's go ahead and let's say al-Assaf.

138
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:22.050
And hmm, you know what, it should work and I don't know why it should work, so if input name equals

139
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.320
Celsius, did we grab it correctly?

140
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.460
So so I mean, just copy it from here and waste it right here.

141
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.150
All right.

142
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.120
So if the input name is Celsius, we want to grab the Fahrenheit and put that value and we want to set

143
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.170
it to temperature value times one point eight plus thirty two.

144
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.630
And I don't know why do we get that.

145
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.720
So if I type in one here, we are not going to get anything.

146
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:56.120
But if I type in one here, type error cannot set property value of null attached additional element.

147
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:04.560
So if I come here it says OK, so now this, this is a typo or it means that we have not specified anything

148
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:04.860
yet.

149
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.470
So let's go ahead and let's complete the rest of this.

150
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:14.500
So, Al Seth, the input name equals.

151
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.700
Farenheit, if it is Farenheit, what do we want to do?

152
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.310
We want to grab the Celsius, the Celsius input value.

153
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:34.110
Value, all right, and we want to set it to so the formula, if you want to change Fahrenheit to Celsius,

154
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:40.510
the formula is the whatever input that you have, minus 32.

155
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.930
And then we divide the entire thing by one point eight.

156
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.590
I'm sure these are like super easy for you.

157
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.130
And we also want to change Fahrenheit to Kalven.

158
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:57.430
So we are going to grab the value and from there we are going to set it to that.

159
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:06.490
So the value is going to be temperature value minus 32, divided by one point eight plus to seventy

160
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.750
three point one five.

161
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:19.900
Right, and finally, our final ounce of Closs statement is if the input name equals Kalven, oops,

162
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.510
what is that?

163
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.050
Jeld-Wen.

164
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.900
So if it is Kalvin, what do we want to do?

165
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:30.590
So when whenever we're typing typing inside the Kalvin, we want to change the Celsius and the Farenheit

166
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.820
so Celsius and put that value.

167
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.990
So now, now we want to change from Kalven to Celsius.

168
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.900
So we are going to grab the temperature value and we are going to subtract to seventy three point one

169
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.280
five and the Fahrenheit input value.

170
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.510
And we want to subtract, we want to say temperature now this is the formula, so temperature value

171
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:05.390
minus to seventy three point one five multiplied by one point eight plus thirty.

172
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.040
All right.

173
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.030
So let's go ahead and check out the Fahrenheit.

174
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.700
Correct.

175
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.800
Correct.

176
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.180
We do have one Fahrenheit here.

177
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.790
Oops.

178
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.300
There is an edge missing.

179
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.720
So let's go ahead and save it.

180
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.710
And.

181
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:29.010
All right, so we have, for example, 50 degrees Celsius is going to be 120 to Fahrenheit and three

182
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.620
twenty three point one five Kelvin.

183
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.350
So I will be checking all the three inputs.

184
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.380
So I'm just going to go ahead and pass and 10.

185
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:46.020
We can see that it works for Fahrenheit and I'm going to pass in, for example, like 300, it works

186
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.710
for that as well.

187
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:52.950
Now, we do have this issue that we have a lot of decimal points.

188
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.420
I want to I want to take care of that as well before wrapping this video up.

189
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:04.590
And I think there is one other issue as well, that whenever any of the input feels, the input field

190
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.650
in which the user is typing is empty.

191
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.920
We don't want the other input fields.

192
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.890
We don't want them to calculate anything.

193
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.640
Now, what do you mean by this?

194
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:25.510
What I mean by this is whenever this input field is empty, this the formula is still going to run for

195
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.280
Fahrenheit on four Celsius.

196
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.070
That is not something that we want.

197
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.820
So we need to take care of that as well now before going further.

198
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.760
I do not like this representation.

199
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.920
So what what I am going to do is to follow best practices.

200
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:45.860
I want to comment about this so not no one is going to get confused and we know that what we what it

201
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.160
is that we are doing here.

202
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.710
So first off, we have Celsius to Fahrenheit.

203
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.900
What are I'm going to do is I want to create a variable and that is going to be Fahrenheit.

204
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:03.350
I'm going to call it farenheit value, right, and for the Farenheit value, what I would like to do

205
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.530
is I'm going to cut off that and I'm going to put it here.

206
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:15.290
And then the Farenheit input value is going to be equal to the Farenheit value.

207
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.250
And then we are going to call the two fixed method on it.

208
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.040
And we just want two decimal points.

209
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.840
Right.

210
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.360
And I'm going to provide a space there.

211
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.010
Let's save it so Celsius to Fahrenheit is done.

212
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:36.340
Next up now, as far as California is concerned, it is just point one five.

213
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.190
So we are not going to see that crazy amount of like.

214
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.490
Decimal points, so I'm not going to I'm not going to touch this.

215
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.250
What I would like to do here, I'm just going to copy that comment and I'm going to come in this one

216
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.030
in common, this one as well.

217
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.960
So this is going to be Celsius to Kelvin.

218
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.220
And in here what we have is so let's copy that.

219
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.710
Let's come here.

220
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.860
So in here we have Fahrenheit to Celsius.

221
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.740
So this is Fahrenheit to Celsius.

222
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.700
So I'm just going to cut that part and I'm going to say Fahrenheit.

223
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:21.770
Two Celsius, and for this, we we are going to have a crazy amount of decimal points.

224
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:27.380
So what I would like to do is I'm going to create another variable and I'm going to call it led Celsius

225
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:34.130
value is going to be equal to our temperature, basically to this formula that we have here.

226
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.470
Not there here.

227
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:43.550
And we are going to say that the Celsius input value is going to be called to this that we have provided

228
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.880
here.

229
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.000
And we are going to call the two fixed method on it.

230
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.990
And we want to fix the decimal points to only two.

231
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.360
I'm going to do the same thing to Fahrenheit, to Kelvin as well here.

232
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:03.990
So I'm just going to remove that space, provide one here and let's copy that comment, let's put it

233
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.470
here.

234
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.250
All right, so this is going to be Calvin.

235
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:16.900
All right, and we have Calvin Input's, I'm just going to cut this and I'm going to say let Calvin

236
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.290
value is going to be equal to this formula.

237
00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.010
This is Calvin value.

238
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:30.160
And in case you're wondering that these about these naming collisions, for example, we have so here

239
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.870
we have a Farenheit value.

240
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:32.670
All right.

241
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.860
So you might we are going to use Farenheit value here as well.

242
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:43.210
But because we are using let the the light is going to grab these curly braces, this set of curly braces,

243
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.210
and it is going to convert it to a scope of itself.

244
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.920
So really, we are not going to have any naming collisions, for that matter.

245
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:58.080
So I'm going to say Calvin value to fixed and we are going to pass in to here.

246
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:06.500
So we have Celsius, Fahrenheit, Celsius to Kalven, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

247
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.090
Let me capitalize this one as well.

248
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.000
This F here as well.

249
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.040
And finally, what do we have?

250
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.670
We have Kalven to Celsius and Kelvin to Fahrenheit.

251
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.780
Now, as far as Kelvin to Celsius is concerned, I'm not going to touch it because we are not going

252
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.190
to have crazy amount of Kelvin.

253
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.590
You know what?

254
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.050
I am going to do that for this one as well.

255
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.900
So we are going to say that Celsius volume I was talking about this naming collision, it is not going

256
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.450
to make any problem because the scope is different.

257
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:49.060
And in here I'm going to say Celsius value to fixed.

258
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.170
All right.

259
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.610
And we're going to pass in to.

260
00:18:53.470 --> 00:19:02.560
So right after that, let's so this is going to be Kalven to Celsius, not Celsius to Kelvin, so Kelvin

261
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:10.060
to Celsius and copy this comment and I'm going to put it right here and we are going to change it to

262
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.560
Fahrenheit.

263
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.170
Perfect.

264
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.380
And we do have a Fahrenheit value.

265
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.410
So I'm just going to grab this part from here and I'm going to put it right here.

266
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.550
And I'm going to copy this part all the way here.

267
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.810
And I'm going to put it here.

268
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:32.680
And we are going to say that the Fahrenheit value is going to be too fixed and we are going to pass

269
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.040
into.

270
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.800
So let's go ahead and let's save that and let's come here.

271
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.690
So if I pass in 10, everything works perfectly fine.

272
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.780
So that is working.

273
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.510
Let's passan for example, hundred and twenty.

274
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.690
We only have two decimal points.

275
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.990
Let's pass and 350 now you can see that we only have two decimal points for all of them.

276
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.050
Now to stay consistent, I'm going to be doing Celsius to Kelvin as well.

277
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:05.200
So let's grab the Kelvin part from here spudded here.

278
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.500
And I'm going to put this one right here and we are going to call the Kelvin value and you're going

279
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.000
to call the two fixed method on it and we are going to pass it.

280
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.720
So now that this problem is solved, there are no errors.

281
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.500
I'm just going to check it one more time.

282
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.150
So everything is working perfectly fine.

283
00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:30.770
All right, so the last thing is whenever we clear the sand, but you can see that we have not a number.

284
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:38.320
So basically, before diving into our statements, into these statements, what I would like to do here

285
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.280
is we would like to do a series of statements.

286
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:55.840
So first off, if the target value, if this is equal to if this is if this is equal to an empty string.

287
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.580
Right.

288
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.950
It means that there is no value there.

289
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.530
What do we want to do here?

290
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:06.700
We want to grab the Celsius input dot value and we want to make it null.

291
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.840
All right.

292
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.810
And we are going to do the same thing for Fahrenheit.

293
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:20.560
So Fahrenheit is perfect and we are going to do the same thing for Kalven input.

294
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.750
So first off, we're going to grab all of them and we are going to make it now and then we want to return

295
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.170
from this function, from this statement.

296
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.910
So now if I go ahead and if I take, for example, hundred and twenty degrees Celsius and if I remove

297
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:42.680
everything, you can see that because this is empty, this is empty, it means that it is not right,

298
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:47.170
because the type that we type here is we have said pass.

299
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.070
And so this is going to give us this temperature value is no.

300
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:57.260
It means that the the value for that, which is a number, is actually not the reason that I have not

301
00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.710
grabbed the temperature value, but I've grabbed the Iida target.

302
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.930
That value is we went over that.

303
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.820
How is the target?

304
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.100
That value is going to give us the strength we need to convert it to a number.

305
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.120
So basically, this is an empty string.

306
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:17.180
So if this equals an empty string, we want to grab all three of them and we want to make him null.

307
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:24.200
It means that we do not want them to go ahead and write anything this null in part.

308
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.060
This is going to take care of that.

309
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.620
Not a number that we see.

310
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.220
And basically, if they're empty, if it is empty, we want to return.

311
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.210
We don't want to do anything else in this in this department.

312
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.220
So I'm just going to go I'm just going to go ahead and say a 150.

313
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:50.080
And we see a three hour, two point oh, and for 23, so if I say for twenty three point one five hundred

314
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.180
and fifty eight point eight five.

315
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.300
So 150 for 23.

316
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:55.820
All right.

317
00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:05.650
So if I do for twenty three point one five, it's almost 150 because we are basically fixing it, then

318
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.630
that's why it's not giving us that exact and fifty and it doesn't really matter that much.

319
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.100
The only thing that matters is that it is working.

320
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.450
So with this, our application comes to an end.

321
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.260
See you guys in the next one.
