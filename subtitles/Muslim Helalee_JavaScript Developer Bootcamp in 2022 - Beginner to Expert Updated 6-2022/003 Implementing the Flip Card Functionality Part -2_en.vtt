00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.819
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:08.590
In this lecture, we are going to pick up where we left off in implementing the Flipkart functionality.

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.880
All right.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.940
So we know that when the car for the first time, when the car is flipped or a car cart is flipped is

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.000
equal to true.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.740
We want to assign the value of this key word, which is exactly the car that the user has claque to

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.790
our first cart.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.240
And in any other scenario, we want to say card is float equal to false and assign the value of the

9
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.630
this key word to the second car.

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.720
So let's go ahead and let's consider log all of these so they make more sense.

11
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.470
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put them inside an object.

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.310
Right.

13
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.760
And we are going to log to the console and object.

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.120
So the first item or the first item in this object is going to be card is flipped and the second one

15
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.100
is going to be first card.

16
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.550
And I'm going to copy this and I'm going to put it right here and in here.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.780
What I'm going to do is.

18
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.370
I'm going to grab the first card and the second card, right?

19
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.730
So this is second card.

20
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.430
Let's save it.

21
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.160
Let's come here and let's go to our project.

22
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.320
Let's go to inspect console.

23
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.010
That's what if I put it on the side?

24
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.300
I mean, would that be better?

25
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.490
Yes, I think this is better.

26
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.910
Right.

27
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.790
This is better.

28
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.650
So if I click on this, it means that the card is flipped is true and the value is the first car.

29
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.580
So let's come here.

30
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.090
Let's see.

31
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.930
So card first card is flipped is true.

32
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.990
So if we come here now, this if statement has run.

33
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.710
All right.

34
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.140
And in that we see card is flipped and first card card is flipped equal to true and first card is the

35
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.540
element that has been clicked.

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.780
So this is the element that has been Kleck, that's why we've put them inside this object, right?

37
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.840
So the first item inside the object is card is flipped, which equals to true.

38
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.370
And the second one shows exactly which card has been flipped.

39
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.420
It doesn't matter if the first if it is the first card, the metro cards or the last one when the user

40
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.400
clicks for the first time.

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.660
On any card, that card is going to be the first card, so let's refresh, if the user clicks on this

42
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080
one, it is going to be our first card.

43
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.370
So first card has that value.

44
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.590
So now let's go ahead and let's click on the second car and then the second car.

45
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.970
We see that that the first car has that value and the second car has this value.

46
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.760
Right.

47
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.340
So this is how we can map which car it is, the car that the user has clicked on.

48
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.290
So if we click on any other car, we are going to see that this if statement works again, which we

49
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.880
are going to prevent it from working as well.

50
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.590
So this is where the logic of this game breaks down.

51
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.610
Of course, we are going to fix this down in our later lectures in this chapter, but we are going to

52
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.370
go ahead and we are going to implement this functionality step by step.

53
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.180
So the first step is we want to find out which is the first card that the user has clicked.

54
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.060
We have successfully mapped it.

55
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.860
This is the first car that the user has clicked.

56
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.670
And we want to know what is the second car that the user has.

57
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.690
So this is the second card that the user has clicked for.

58
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.760
Now, we are not interested in the third or fourth card.

59
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.320
We are going to lock the board.

60
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.490
Don't worry about that.

61
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.520
So we have successfully found our first card and our second card.

62
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.080
At this point, what I'm going to do is we have to find out whether those two cards they match.

63
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.420
So I'm going to come out of here.

64
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.160
So I'm just going to add a comment the first.

65
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:17.510
I'm just going to say first click, first click, and this is going to be first court, right?

66
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.709
Let's put it right here and.

67
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.610
It's Gravett second, kaleck second card.

68
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:36.160
Um, checking whether the cards match.

69
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.880
All right, so we want to check whether the cards match.

70
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.900
So first off, before going further, what I'm going to do is we are going to consult a lot of things,

71
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:55.620
right, because it provides a better understanding, better stream of understanding for everyone.

72
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.540
OK, so we are going to grab our first card and we are going to grab we're going to go into data set

73
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320
now this data set property.

74
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.500
This is going to tap in inside here, this data.

75
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.010
So this data set is going to grab this value.

76
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.700
Right.

77
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.710
And and here is the interesting thing about this HTML attribute that we can modify to our own.

78
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.380
Well, so what comes after this?

79
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.920
I'm going to put in a name and you might ask why name?

80
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.420
Why do we need to know the name?

81
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.510
Because whenever when I created this data name attribute, I told you guys in our very first lecture

82
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:43.650
that this data dash is provided by e-mail, but this name part is optional, is arbitrary.

83
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.850
You can write anything that you want.

84
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.490
And I have written a name.

85
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:57.320
So this name, whenever whatever you write here, you can access the value of this attribute through

86
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.840
this name, through this thing that you have added here.

87
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.020
That's why we've provided names.

88
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.250
So this name is the same name as this one right here.

89
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.250
And when we do that, we will be able to grab the baby bear value.

90
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.300
All right.

91
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.310
So let's cancel it and let's see how it works.

92
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.640
Let's come here.

93
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.620
Let's click on this and we see it is a baby bear, so let's click on this.

94
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.830
We see we see again baby bear, right?

95
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.260
Because this is the second car click.

96
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.690
We see cat claque.

97
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.580
We see another cat.

98
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.720
This is a bird.

99
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.640
This is a bird.

100
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.370
This is a hamster hamster.

101
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.530
You see, dog, dog.

102
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.510
And this is going to be curious cat.

103
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.460
And this is going to be curious.

104
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.370
Get there is some problems here.

105
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.810
So let's go ahead and let's consider log the second card as well.

106
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.780
So second card.

107
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.150
Let's see if it works properly this time.

108
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.120
Dataset of and defined at 23.

109
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.650
So second card.

110
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:19.130
Yes, it's exactly line 23, so let's go to console, let's trash everything and let's come here.

111
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.650
Second card.

112
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.680
The name second card, the data set name.

113
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.170
All right, so we are out of our statement, right?

114
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:43.100
Or we are inside the L statement, I think we are still we should still be inside the L statement because

115
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.260
this is a part of the L statement.

116
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.300
So let's go inside there.

117
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.010
All right.

118
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.810
So now let's go ahead and let's click.

119
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.980
This is our first card.

120
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.420
Right?

121
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.520
And when I click on the second one, it shows that both of them are baby bear Strache.

122
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.990
It it's reload the page.

123
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.730
Let's click on this one.

124
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.510
This is Bert.

125
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.250
And if I click on this one, so the first one is Bird and the second one is Cat.

126
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:07.940
All right.

127
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.370
So what does this mean?

128
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.580
It means that we want to find out.

129
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:20.120
We want to find out whether the first card and the second card, they are the same.

130
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.780
OK, so when the text of the date to name is the same, for example, when baby bear equals baby bear,

131
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.060
then they should stay.

132
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.740
It means that they match.

133
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.200
So if I click on this one and I this this one, both of them are the same, then they match.

134
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:36.690
Right.

135
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.580
So let's go ahead and let's implement that functionality.

136
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.140
So I'm just going to go ahead and should I remove them.

137
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:51.710
Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and remove them because we have a lot of code and you have it in the video,

138
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.830
so there is no need to put them there.

139
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.570
So what I'm going to do here is.

140
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:10.020
We are going to create another if statement, and we want to find out if the first card data set name

141
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:20.550
equals the second card data set name, and then if they match, we want to we want to add an event listener

142
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.140
or remove the event listener.

143
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.750
Right.

144
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.400
So that functionality we are going to complete in our next lecture.

145
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.690
See you guys then.
