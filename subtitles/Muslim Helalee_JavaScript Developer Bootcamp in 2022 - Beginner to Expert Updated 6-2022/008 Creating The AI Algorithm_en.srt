1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,550
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,880
In this letter, we are going to write the algorithm for the eye of this game.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:15,080
All right, so I'm going to try to wrap this game up in this lecture so it might become like a longer

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,640
lecture than than usual.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:24,440
So let's see the first things that I would like to do as I'm going to I've come here to this new game

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:25,990
function.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,390
All right.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,870
And.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,370
All right, before going that, I've come to this click function and we have said that if it is not

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,580
the player's turn, the other player should not be able to click.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And if that's why we have returned from this.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:48,380
And the other thing that I would like to do is, all right, so I would like to come down, let's see

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,790
where I would like to go.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,670
I just want to get rid of that selection.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,200
So let's go to the highlight grid, which is the highlight grid.

16
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:05,750
So Selex, this is draw text, this is drug read, this is the create create Kleck.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,360
Oh, there it is.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,370
And I want to return from this as well.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,060
If it is not the player's turn or the game is over.

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,200
Just returned from that.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,730
We do not want to highlight the crit.

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,510
So you can see that it is not my turn.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,770
That's why you can see you can't see any highlighting.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,050
No, not my turn.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,670
Not it's not my turn, and now it is my turn.

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,330
It only highlights when it is my turn right.

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,350
It is the Eastern and when I click, you can see nothing else is being highlighted because now it is

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,160
the computer's turn.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,300
OK, so what we are going to do is we are going to code the computer and in this lecture and I'm going

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,780
to name it the go A.I. or I think that makes more sense.

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,040
So let's come here, I'm going to go to a game loop, where is the game loop?

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,770
There it is.

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,830
This is the game loop.

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:09,400
And right here I'm going to say I and I'm going to create an R and I function.

35
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,560
It gives me a text.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to say just I.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,810
And inside here, I'm going to pass an hour time difference.

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,700
Right, so now let's go ahead and let's actually create this EHI.

39
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:31,350
All right, and I'm going to go down here, so where is our let's see where I do I want to put this.

40
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,410
Or should I put this function, doesn't really matter, just going to go ahead and select cells on top

41
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,220
of these, so I'm just going to put in the A.I. function.

42
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,640
Perfect.

43
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,540
So let's create this function.

44
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:55,550
So let's say function A.I. and this is going to take in a difference as a parameter.

45
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:03,910
And in here, first stuff we need to check if if it is the player's turn or if it is the game over.

46
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,780
We do not want to run anything.

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:12,770
So if it is the player's turn, it means it is the our eyes turn we or if it is the if game is over,

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,900
we want to return from this function.

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,680
That is the first thing that we want to do.

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,720
Now, first off, let's go ahead and let's put in a comment here.

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,810
So I'm going to say count down, I'm going to create a countdown and this is going to be the delay.

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:38,900
DeLay the A.I. until it makes a selection, it makes its selection.

53
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,960
It's sort of like we we want the A.I. to think for like half a second or four, like less than that.

54
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,690
And then we want it to, like, actually return something to actually, like make its its selection.

55
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,700
So I'm going to say if.

56
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,870
The I'm going to call this time is greater than zero.

57
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:12,040
We are going to say time, a time I is we are going to reduce from that or subtract from it.

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,070
The time difference that we have.

59
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,370
So in this case, it is the parameter of difference.

60
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,080
Right now, if the time I want of my writing, if the time I.

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
Is less than or equal to zero.

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,440
So it is equal to zero.

63
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,240
We want the A.I. to make it smooth, so we are going to call these select cell function and right after

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,220
that we are going to return from this investment return.

65
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,680
We don't want this if statement to do anything else and we will be actually returning from the function

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,110
as well.

67
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,140
So we just want to return.

68
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,390
The next thing that I would like to do as.

69
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,390
Huh?

70
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,870
All right, I want to create that time for our A.I..

71
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,760
All right, so let's go to the top.

72
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,480
Let's create the time delay.

73
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,320
So if I come here, it doesn't really matter where I put it, I'm just going to put it here and I'm

74
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,310
going to call this.

75
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:28,430
Delaying the Ehi, so delay underscore ehi and we are going to set it.

76
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,430
So I want to, I want the AI to be delayed by half a second and I'm going to put in a comment for this

77
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,910
as well.

78
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:47,830
So it's going to be seconds for the AI to make or to take its turn to take its turn right.

79
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,070
So now let's go ahead and let's actually code the A.I..

80
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,900
OK, so what do we have here?

81
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,950
So I'm going to go to the ice function, where is the ice function?

82
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,900
It was, I think, down below.

83
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,360
So where is the iSelect cell?

84
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
This is the kaleck.

85
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,060
I kind of actually lost it, so I'm just going to search for it.

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,950
I am going to search for it, I.

87
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,040
Come on, ay, ay.

88
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,790
So it is there and right after it is right, it's right there.

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,910
OK, so.

90
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,520
What do we want?

91
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,630
What do I want to do here first?

92
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,550
First off, I want to check for the I want to highlight the selected cell.

93
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,760
So before actually making its choice, the eye has to highlight the cell.

94
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,430
So I'm going to say highlight the selected cell.

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,130
Basically, the way that we are coding this is as if it was an actual human.

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,670
So for that, we are going to call the highlights cell function.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,080
The highlights of function is going to grab the X position and the Y position.

98
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:13,860
The X position is going to be the great zero row because it can select the first row first and the column

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,560
could be any column it could select from any column.

100
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,440
And we are going to pass in the center X, we are going to do the same thing, but for the center Y

101
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,550
so grid.

102
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,590
Come on.

103
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,730
What am I right in here?

104
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,010
I'm getting tired, so I'm putting it at the.

105
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,730
It can select only from the first row at first and it can select from any column that it want and the

106
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,750
set and the position for that is going to be the center.

107
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,190
Why?

108
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,390
OK, so this is the first thing that we are going to do for the.

109
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,660
The next thing that I want to do is I want to actually go ahead and set up the algorithm.

110
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,810
So for this, I'm going to create a different comment and I'm going to say setting up the AI.

111
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,060
Algorithm.

112
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,710
All right, so let's go ahead and set up the algorithm, the first part of the algorithm is going to

113
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,270
be creating the an options array for the A.I. So what are the options of this A.I.?

114
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,830
So I'm going to say creating the options array.

115
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,320
So there are actually going to be four options, so I'm just going to say options, right?

116
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,480
And I'm going to initialize it as an empty array.

117
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,340
And then so the first option that the A's going to have.

118
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,130
So this is going to be the item zero in that array.

119
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,500
I'm going to put it to.

120
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,380
We are going to put all of them to empty arrays.

121
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,860
The first option is when the A.I. wins.

122
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,140
Right, this I'm just going to copy, you know, what this is like takes a lot of time to write it out.

123
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,390
I'm just going to put it here.

124
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,590
The second item inside that array is going to be the second option the A.I. has.

125
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,510
The second option is going to be just block the player.

126
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm just going to put in block the r.i.

127
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,510
This is the second option for the A.I..

128
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:29,510
The third option, the third option for the eye is whenever the eye makes, well, not an important

129
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:29,960
move.

130
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,730
For example, I'm selecting a cell important and the eyes casually selecting a cell, and that's really

131
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,870
not that big of a deal.

132
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,330
The fourth option is actually as is an important option.

133
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,670
And this is when the eye.

134
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,910
Yeah.

135
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,410
Lets the r.i win.

136
00:09:51,570 --> 00:10:00,410
I mean, it cannot actually block the r.i and it cannot make a significant move and it cannot win.

137
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,970
So the final option is to let the RIAA win.

138
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:14,990
OK, so in the second it blocks the DRC, it makes not an not an important move and then it lets the

139
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,640
DRC win.

140
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,780
All right, so.

141
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:28,020
What I'm going to do down below is I'm going to say randomly select a column.

142
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:34,720
In a in a priority order, in a priority order.

143
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,780
OK, so let's say let's first initialize our column and we're going to say if if options.

144
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:51,980
The first, if it is the first option that the ATO has and the length in that option is great and that

145
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,330
options array is greater than zero, it means that the AIA is making his first move.

146
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:02,780
We're going to say that the column could be, whichever it is that the AIU, whichever that the AIA

147
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,680
wants to choose.

148
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,370
All right.

149
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,750
And whichever is going to be actually a random number.

150
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:17,240
So we are going to say that the options, the first item can be any number.

151
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:23,840
So we are going to use the math, that floor, the math, that floor is going to give us a whole integer.

152
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,310
And this random is going to take a look at any random column.

153
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,420
And select it now, we need to multiply it by the options length and whichever the options length is

154
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,030
that which is going to be like only one.

155
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,050
So the eye can only select one of the columns at one time.

156
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,710
All right.

157
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,530
So we need to multiply it by the length as well.

158
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,810
So we need to tell the eye that you can only Celenk select one one length one of the options or one

159
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,680
of the columns.

160
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,440
So the columns that the eye select is going to be pushed inside this.

161
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,180
The first option that we have and we are going to get a a whole integer by saying that floor and made

162
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,430
that random is going to be a random column, and then we are going to multiply it by the length.

163
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,420
All right.

164
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,000
So we're going to say l f.

165
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,540
al-Assaf, basically, it's going to be the same thing, but for the second one, so I'm just going

166
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,170
to pass it right here and the length stretch.

167
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,630
Make sure you do not misspell anything for the second one.

168
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,350
We go do the second option, which is it blocks the dry.

169
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,790
If it blocks the right, what it should do.

170
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,190
I'm going to grab that column.

171
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,420
I'm going to put it right here.

172
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,540
It is going to the column should be whichever column that the eight blocks.

173
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,200
All right, so the rest of the Ellsworth's are going to be almost the same, so I'm going to put it

174
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,590
there.

175
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,960
So I'm just going to grab these and I'm going to put it to two and.

176
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,120
Right.

177
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,720
Where is the curly brace?

178
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,370
There it is.

179
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,810
So this is the Ancef, and for that we need a curly brace as well.

180
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,270
So this is zero.

181
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,260
This is one.

182
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:29,740
This says this Ancef is one, this else if is to and finally this LGF is going to be three.

183
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,590
So now we have we have taught the A.I. to randomly select a column in a priority order.

184
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:46,260
The next thing that I would like to do here is I want to loop through each of the columns to check for

185
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,860
a win.

186
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,430
Right.

187
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,440
Based on the priorities on I'm going to say loop through.

188
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,010
Though through.

189
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,170
Each column, each column.

190
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,930
So let's say we have a variable of sell and we are going to say four let I equals zero.

191
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,610
I is less than the grade columns.

192
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,060
I is less than the number of columns.

193
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:22,510
And each time we are going to increment the design, so we are going to say sell is equal to the highlights

194
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,740
of functions and now we need to pass in the actual position for that.

195
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,690
We have done that right here.

196
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,710
So I'm just going to copy.

197
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,370
This is going to be a bit different.

198
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,690
I do not want to type that out.

199
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:41,980
So the column is going to be I because the ace is we are looping through the columns.

200
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,660
I'm just going to pass and put it in there as well.

201
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,040
So if the column is full.

202
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,340
The I should go to the next column.

203
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,710
Right.

204
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:04,230
That's why we are looping over that, of course, if a cell is equal to now, if there is no cell,

205
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,760
we want the A.I. to continue.

206
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,750
With its search.

207
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,800
And continue in this case means it means I'm not going to write it.

208
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:20,450
It means that the A.I. is going to break out of this iteration of this, the first iteration, and then

209
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,560
it is going to go to the next iteration.

210
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,330
Right.

211
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,560
Right after that, we are going to say so the first priority, what was the first priority?

212
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:39,550
When the A.I. wins, perfect, so when the AI wins, it means that the owner of the cell, so cell owner

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
is going to be the player's turn.

214
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,940
Perfect it is.

215
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,410
Now, keep in mind that whenever we're using this player's turn, we're actually talking about in some

216
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:57,010
contexts we talk about whenever, for example, where is the player's turn if I come down here?

217
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,480
In this context, the player turned could be either Ehi or R.I or was what is the other context that

218
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,580
we talked about?

219
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,570
So if I come here.

220
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,620
No, not there.

221
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,150
This is the EHI function.

222
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm going to show you a context in which the player's turn is actually the the, our eyes turn.

223
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,520
It's never going to be the eyes turn in this context.

224
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,110
It's still if it is going to be either the ah I ordered the eye.

225
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,360
So in which context can we find that they're here.

226
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,530
So this highlight great function, it says that if it is the players, if it is not the player's turn

227
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,390
or if the game is true, then return.

228
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:48,330
It means that in this context the player's turn is going to be the turn for the are I not I.

229
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,440
So we are using this term interchangeably depending on the context that we have.

230
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,870
So in this case, it is going to be I'm just going to write, I turn so so you understand really what's

231
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,340
happening.

232
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,920
So in here, what we need to do is we need to check for a win.

233
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:12,420
So I'm going to say check when Chegwidden is going to grab the cell, the and the column.

234
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,650
So I'm going to say cell row and cell dot com.

235
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:25,190
When we check for that, what do we want to do, because this is the first priority, we are going to

236
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:32,570
grab the first item and we are going to push this loop variable to that.

237
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,540
And we are going to say Owles.

238
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:47,450
This is going to be the second priority, second priority, and that is I blocks the hour, I am just

239
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:56,330
going to put in r.i in this case the cells owner is not DCI, so it is not player's turn.

240
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,630
It means that the cells owner is.

241
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,620
Are I right.

242
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,340
So it is the cells owner is r.i.

243
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:15,290
And we are going to check if the check when function, lets pass the arguments there, so sell dot roll

244
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,850
and sell dot com.

245
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,320
We are going to push to the second option.

246
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,950
Right.

247
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,750
So options, let's grab the second item and we are going to push Bush to that.

248
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,560
The I the loof variable.

249
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:42,290
And then inside of here, we are going to say alse, if sell that owner, if soldat owner is the player's

250
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,290
turn as the players turn.

251
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:56,110
What do we want to do that we want to check the cell above, right, so I'm going to say check the cell

252
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,620
above.

253
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,790
If there is no cell underneath the air, I can select the above cell.

254
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:08,350
So we are going to say if cell Dutrow is greater than zero, it means the bottom row has been the bottom

255
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,720
row of the cell has been felt.

256
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,940
We need this to go up one level.

257
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,540
All right, but we need to check if that is which, if that is the ice turn or not, we need to check

258
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,290
for that as well.

259
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,310
So we are going to say if cell when row minus one.

260
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,590
We are going to go one level up and these cells call them.

261
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,250
That owner is not the player's turn.

262
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,170
It's not the player's turn.

263
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:48,260
And so this is going to be we are checking for the above self and and now let's go ahead and check for

264
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,580
our fourth priority.

265
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,790
Now, you can see that all these if statements are being nested here.

266
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,630
So you have to keep that in mind as well.

267
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,170
So I'm going to say fourth priority.

268
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,490
This is a bit complicated.

269
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,920
I know.

270
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,950
And that's what I meant, that this is going to be JavaScript advanced to expert if you're not feeling

271
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,800
comfortable with any of these concepts, the array pushing to that, the last item, negative one,

272
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,210
you could you have to go back to those chapters and you have to polish your knowledge.

273
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,490
All right.

274
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:26,630
So we are going to say, do not let the player one, let the player right now in the fourth priority,

275
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,900
the A.I. gives a when, but we don't.

276
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,980
We are telling it, do not do it.

277
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:31,970
All right.

278
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,140
So we are going to grab the check one function one more time.

279
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,350
And we are going to sell Dutrow minus one for the this is going to be the row and the column is going

280
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,550
to be Soldat column.

281
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,490
We are basically grabbing the wrong column from there.

282
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:57,870
And now we are going to push to the fourth array, push the eye to the fourth array.

283
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:05,320
And finally, after this statement, we are going to pass in our alts and that is going to be the third

284
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,470
priority.

285
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:15,520
Now, the third priority is when the A.I. makes not an important move, when it makes not an important

286
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,930
move.

287
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,830
And we are going to say else.

288
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,680
Anything in any other scenario, just push it to the third options array.

289
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:35,990
All right, so and finally, what after it does all of these calculations, what I want to do is I want

290
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,980
the I want to deselect all these cells, right?

291
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:47,350
Because whenever the A.I. selects one cell, I want to deselect any cell that the IAEA has not selected.

292
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,840
So let's grab the cell, Dutrow.

293
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,380
If we do not deselected, then with one selection, the air will be able to select all of these cells

294
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,530
and that is not something that we want.

295
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,050
So that honor is equal to.

296
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:13,200
No, we just say that I'm just going to put in a common deselect the cell above.

297
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,040
Above.

298
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,610
Right, right after that.

299
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:27,730
OK, I just want to put in this here as well, if there is no Rosabeth, if there is no rule above,

300
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,160
it means that the column has filled up.

301
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:38,000
We are going to go to our third priority priority, which is not making an important move.

302
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:46,570
So if there is no cell in that row, sorry, if there is no cell in that column, it could go to either

303
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,710
of the other columns.

304
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,410
So it's not that big of a deal.

305
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,210
We're going to say else options.

306
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,760
So we are going to push it to the second to the third array.

307
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,370
And once the aid is done, we are going to cancel the highlight and this election, so we are going

308
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,250
to say cancel the highlight and this election.

309
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:21,440
All right and OK, so we are going to grab these soldat that highlight, so where is the highlight cell

310
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:28,580
that highlighted should be no cell darte owner should be.

311
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:28,940
No.

312
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:39,430
And finally, the final piece of this game is going to be we need to clear the winning cells whenever

313
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,730
we click there for the next iteration, for the next time that the request animation frames comes.

314
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,600
And we need to clear that.

315
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,170
So I'm just going to say clear.

316
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,970
Clear the.

317
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,650
The winning sells.

318
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:13,390
Right, and this is going to be the end of the game, so for that row of gret for Lietzau of a row,

319
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,170
all of them are going to sell Dot Wener is going to be equal to.

320
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:28,440
So now hopefully this is completed and we are finally able to play this game.

321
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:35,420
So let's go ahead and let's actually play this, we can see that it says four hundred and thirty we

322
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:42,500
have we are missing a bracket, so 430, whereas line for 30.

323
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,100
Oh, else there is a typo there.

324
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,450
Center X cannot re type error for sixty.

325
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,540
So we do have some typos there.

326
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,050
So if I go to four sixty we have highlights.

327
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:04,970
So grid zero column and center X and center Y.

328
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,720
Why is it throwing an error there should not throw an error there?

329
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,660
OK, so it's hmm, we have our we are getting our DNA.

330
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,410
That's correct.

331
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,130
The highlight highlights cell function we have called the highlight cell function and we are getting

332
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:37,220
the we are getting our grid the column from the grid and the center X, also the grid center of why.

333
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,290
I mean, is there something wrong with the highlights?

334
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,520
It says that there is 460 and let's play game 111.

335
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,370
Let's go to line 100 and 11.

336
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,790
And a time difference.

337
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,660
One, when when oh, this is when the function was called, right?

338
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,280
So.

339
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,840
Hmm.

340
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,500
Now, before actually solving that problem, what I'm going to do is I'm going to come to this, I remember

341
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,810
that we created a delay for the A.I. and that was half a second, but we never used it.

342
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,790
So we can see if I just control D there is no other we have not actually used.

343
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:30,440
So if I come to four hundred, were the A.I. functions at the end of this, I'm just going to call the

344
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,060
time I is going to be equal to the delay I.

345
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,430
The delay, not delay, noad delay, so let's save it.

346
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,320
Let's come here, and it is still saying that there is a problem there.

347
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,850
We have successfully specified that there.

348
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,460
OK, do we have that problem here?

349
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,560
That's network.

350
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,610
This is the council.

351
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,400
We don't have that problem here.

352
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,270
So let's take a look at that.

353
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:14,190
So what I'm going to do actually here is I'm going to collapse first all of these functions that we

354
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,940
have created.

355
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,850
I think there is something wrong with the order of these functions, because I believe that we have

356
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,790
used the highlights.

357
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,940
So before the syntax is familiar, let's see where we have used it.

358
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,820
OK, I'm just collapsing them.

359
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
I'm looking for the highlights, so.

360
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,880
And we have used the highlight cell here, and you can see that it doesn't throw an error.

361
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,690
For that, we had this is the function itself.

362
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:48,590
This is going to be the connect for and this is the check when this is the game loop.

363
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,590
I'm not going to touch the game loop that's collapsed.

364
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,190
This one collapsed the set dimensions.

365
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,970
So the way that I'm going to reorder this is I'm going to first put our check one function, then the

366
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,140
connect for then I'm going to grab the kaleck, I'm going to cut it.

367
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,830
And right after the connect for I'm going to put in the click.

368
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:17,110
And right after the break, we are going to put in the create grid, you know what, actually these

369
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,560
are the highlights cell and highlight grid.

370
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:27,550
I'm just going to cut this from right here and I'm going to put them after the EHI.

371
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,150
So after the I'm just going to put them right here.

372
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,230
So I'm just going to come in this one collapse.

373
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,690
That collapse, this one.

374
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,790
So we have after the click, what do we have.

375
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,820
So I'm just going to remove the space.

376
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,220
Remove the space after the click.

377
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,990
We have the create.

378
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,400
Great.

379
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,910
I'm just going to cut this one as well.

380
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,650
The create grid.

381
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,330
Then we have the drawback ground.

382
00:28:52,330 --> 00:29:00,340
Draw a grid, draw text A.I. and highlight cell highlight grid.

383
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,530
Right after the highlight grid.

384
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:08,080
I'm going to put in the new game function and then we have our select cell and said dimensions.

385
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,970
So let's save it.

386
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,230
Now you can see that the error was basically just we had to reorder some things.

387
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,970
Why is it coming back?

388
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,470
OK, so.

389
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,250
OK, there we go.

390
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,470
So I'm just going to you know what, I'm just going to close this.

391
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,460
Do we have that same order for this?

392
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,440
No, we don't.

393
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:35,600
So I'm just going to go ahead and open this one live server one more time and we still get that error

394
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,740
and I have no idea why do we get that error?

395
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,540
411.

396
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:53,140
So it says that cannot read property of this highlight, sell a grid zero column is going to be zero

397
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:59,360
that Senator X and Grid zero column that Senator Y kind of read this.

398
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,810
And I actually I have no idea why is this happening.

399
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:15,000
All right, so on this on second thought, I would like to try to debug this error using this sources,

400
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,950
using the call stack.

401
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:22,190
We have talked about this, but we have not really used it in a real world scenario.

402
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,020
So this is a good use case for the call stack.

403
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,050
And you can see that the error is right here.

404
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:33,330
And it says uncute type error cannot read property of undefined.

405
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,410
So it means that it's a type error.

406
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,720
It means that we have certainly mis typed something.

407
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:45,240
So if I click here, you can see that we have created a brand new breakpoint and after I collect, I'm

408
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,280
just going to go ahead and I'm going to reload the page.

409
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,120
And you can see that we get all these things here, that all these calculations based on this highlight

410
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,420
grid.

411
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,270
And you can see that it says column is undefined.

412
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,270
This is undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined.

413
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,620
So all of these are undefined.

414
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,130
The computer is doing nothing.

415
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:09,030
So if I come to the play game, which is this right here, we don't have any errors here.

416
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,910
But you can see that we have all of our calculations inside here.

417
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,810
But now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the A.I. itself.

418
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,080
And in here we can see that we have all these undefined.

419
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:29,490
So the cell is undefined, even though if I am if I am right, we have we have defined the cell.

420
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,510
You can see it is going to say that it is paused inside debugger.

421
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,140
Right.

422
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,550
But that doesn't matter.

423
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,080
We have specified the cell to to this.

424
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,420
So it says the cell is undefined and.

425
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,380
What is this?

426
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:52,970
We have said that the cells should be equal to the highlights, so this is I mean, this is if I change

427
00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:00,260
it to an equal sign into a cell minus the highlight, it means that we have never actually defined our

428
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,600
cell.

429
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,410
So now if I put it back there and.

430
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,220
Let me go ahead.

431
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,930
Let me come down here.

432
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,490
Let's grab this, reload the page.

433
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,990
Let's grab it.

434
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,410
And I'm going to go ahead and reload the page.

435
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,960
We should see all the errors.

436
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,760
It's reloaded one more time.

437
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,360
Let's actually click and reload and.

438
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,520
Come on, show it to me.

439
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,860
So this is where the error was.

440
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,460
Perfect.

441
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,770
So we don't see the errors anymore, even though this is incorrect.

442
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,310
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go out of it.

443
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,450
We can see our error was gone.

444
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,430
So I'm just going to go ahead and still says undefined.

445
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,850
I'm just going to reload.

446
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,050
And you can see it automatically comes to where I was before.

447
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,850
So now I can see that this cell the problem is that this cell is undefined, even though.

448
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:17,580
We have we have declared the cell, we have initialized it, and we this is actually a declaration,

449
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,700
we declared it, but we didn't initialize it.

450
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,000
So in here we we did initialize it to this value.

451
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,210
So instead of that, if I just put in a plus sign soon here you can see that it is negative.

452
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,270
This was a basic typo, if I put it to that.

453
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,270
And if I refresh this page, we shouldn't see any errors here.

454
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,190
Now you can see that the cell actually has a value.

455
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,340
This is the left.

456
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,240
This is the right.

457
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,500
This is all the computer that the computer is actually calculating this.

458
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,870
So this is our algorithm kicking into motion.

459
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,570
So the cell, all of them, because it's not doing any move, it's actually doing that.

460
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,910
So I'm going to reload the page.

461
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,470
This is our project.

462
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,210
Let's remove that.

463
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,010
Let's play against this computer.

464
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,720
And I could play it in this lecture or I could play it in the next one.

465
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,130
But what I'm going to do, actually, is I'm going to play like for a minute or two with the computer

466
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,020
and this lecture and we are going to wrap this entire project up.

467
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,170
I'm sorry for that.

468
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:23,040
But actually I'm not, because that actually showed us how we can debug our code, using the console,

469
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,850
using the sources and using the call stack.

470
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,290
It was it the sources think it was sources.

471
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:35,719
Yeah, using the sources and the call stack, so the FBI makes that move, I'm just going to create

472
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,679
a one there.

473
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,929
I'm going to create one here.

474
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:46,150
You can see that these are insignificant moves by the A.I. So the because this roll was felt, the moved

475
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,540
to another one and the air's trying to block me.

476
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,830
Just going to put one there and I'm going to put one here, the air is going for two.

477
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,250
And so either this one or that one, I'm going to block the A.I. So I'm going to block it there as well.

478
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,440
Let's see who wins.

479
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,230
All right.

480
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,460
I'm going to put.

481
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,530
So I'm going to put one here, the I put.

482
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,390
OK, so if I if I don't put it there is going to block me there.

483
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,240
So they just locked me here.

484
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:28,870
I'm just going to block it here and all right, I'm going to block the oh, the computer one to see

485
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,500
the Iowa.

486
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,030
So now let's play it again.

487
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,310
I'm going to try to win against the EHI.

488
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,930
Uh huh.

489
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,170
Hmm.

490
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,870
Oh, okay, so now if I put it right here, the eye puts it there.

491
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,210
Let's place it here and let's try to actually win.

492
00:35:52,460 --> 00:36:01,940
OK, so is there any four in a row you can see that the air is making significant moves, it is blocking

493
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:07,880
me and it is making an insignificant move and it is actually trying to win.

494
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:30,140
Uh, no one is the one well, I give that three, so it's OK.

495
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,910
So if I put one here, there's going to score, I'm not going to do it.

496
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,160
So this is going to stand.

497
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,440
Hmm, that's on here.

498
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,270
Let's put it here, this is going to put it there.

499
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,400
That's place one dot there.

500
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,210
And we are going to see eventually who is going to put one here.

501
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,500
So let's do that.

502
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,840
Let me try to put one here.

503
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,830
And.

504
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:27,930
You can see that the air had to put one here and now I blocked it there and I'm going to put one right

505
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,410
here.

506
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,610
It doesn't matter if there are three, you have to connect four.

507
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,250
So if I put.

508
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,320
One right here.

509
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,080
They are.

510
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,820
There and you can see the blocked me again here.

511
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:57,220
And that's, you know, this place there and then here it's now you can see it says so it's good we

512
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,630
checked for that as well.

513
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,760
So let's check for this.

514
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,030
Let's put one here and now.

515
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,020
If I put one here, I'm going to win from the air.

516
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,240
So the I block me there, but they cannot block me here.

517
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,580
That's the only case that you're going to beat this year.

518
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,090
So it's a pretty powerful I know it is my turn.

519
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:23,230
And when it is my turn, the I cannot when they cannot take and make a move and when it is very stern,

520
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,340
I cannot make a move.

521
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,480
And the only thing that I want to check for is, for example, going to let the I win.

522
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,350
So just go ahead and put forward their.

523
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:39,480
And the air one can see the selection doesn't work, so that's it for this project and for this chapter.

524
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,190
See you guys in the next one.
