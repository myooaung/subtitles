00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,760
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,900
In this next year, we are going to implement the functionality of our darkman toggle.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,390
All right.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,160
So basically we need to grab two things in our JavaScript.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,100
So the first thing is, yes, you guessed it right.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,450
It is going to be our button.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,780
So I'm going to say check box.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,040
Oops, the equals sign should come after it.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,160
And we're going to say document dot, query selector and we are going to add it.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,080
We are going to grab it through its input attribute.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,880
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to decrease the width and I'm going increase the width on

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,490
this one.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,420
So we are going to use it.

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,370
We are going to select it through attributes, selectors and for using attribute structures.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,640
We first write the name of the element that we want to select and then inside the brackets we write

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,790
the attribute for that.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,600
So it is going to have an attribute, which is name is going to be theme.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,040
So this is the attribute that that input has.

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,150
And if you come here, it has an attribute name which with a value of theme.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,660
And the next thing that I want to grab is going to be our etch HTML element.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:28,980
Well, um, and I mean, this should be capitalized, right, and this is the second thing, and as

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:37,320
with the body element, I finish him of document we do have is a reserved selector for a stimulus element

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,770
as well.

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,720
And that is the document element.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,680
So whenever you do document element, this line is going to return an e-mail element.

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,230
So if we were to go ahead and to cancel the log it.

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,610
Consider log HTML element, let's save it, let's come to the console and we are going to get our e-mail

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,130
documents, see, so we are going to get the entire esteemable document.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,830
So it is going to return the entire original document.

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,750
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the check box and I'm going to add event listener because

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,280
we are listening for a click.

32
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:21,270
When the user clicks the checkbox and when the user clicks the checkbox, we are going to run in a function

33
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,800
and in the function, we are going to basically check for a condition.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,300
Now, what is the condition that we want to check?

35
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:38,650
We want to check that if our HDMI document has a data theme, value of light, if if the data theme

36
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,880
attribute of the original document has a value of light, then toggle it to dark.

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,630
And if it has a data stream value of dark, then toggle it to light.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,590
That's it.

39
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,570
That's basically what we want to do.

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,530
So we are going to say F so f so first we are going to write a checkbox if checkbox is checked.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,710
Right.

42
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,730
So when checkbox is checked, we are going to grab the HTML element and we are going to say classless

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,360
and we are going to toggle what is the class that we want to toggle.

44
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,590
Now this is the transition class because we want to smoothly transition everything.

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,830
So this is the transition costs.

46
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,190
Right.

47
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,850
And toggle, as we talked about in our previous project, takes a look at that element.

48
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,700
And if it has that class, it is going to remove it.

49
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,070
If it doesn't have it, it is going to add it.

50
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,300
Right.

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,370
And then we are going to grab the demo element and we are going to say set attribute, set attribute.

52
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,780
Now, if the checkbox is checked, we want to set the attribute to dark.

53
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,130
So what is the attribute name?

54
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,340
The attribute name is data dash theme and what is the value that we want to set it with?

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,110
We want to set it with dark.

56
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,140
What is the value for this data thing?

57
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:09,510
We want to set it to dark and else in any other condition, meaning that the HTML, the checkbox is

58
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,140
not checked.

59
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,210
So we have two conditions, whether the checkbox is checked or the checkbox is not checked.

60
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,930
So this else is also going to be applied only on one condition, and that is when the checkbox is not

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,410
checked.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,590
We are going to say toggle the transition.

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,730
And Xitian.

64
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,030
Toggle the transition.

65
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:36,350
I mean, we could have said that whenever the checkbox is checked just at the class of transition and

66
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,460
when the checkbox is not checked, it remove the class of transition.

67
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,080
We could do this as well.

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,510
But I just want to go with toggled.

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,880
That's more that's better and more advanced.

70
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,860
And we are going to say HTML element, dot sit attribute.

71
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,290
What is that truth that we want to say?

72
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:02,420
It is data dash theme and what is what is it that we want to set it with?

73
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,610
It is light, so let's save it.

74
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,610
And now now the checkbook's is not checked.

75
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,760
That's why it has a data theme of light.

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,100
So if I click on it now, the checkbox is checked and it is going to have a data theme of dark.

77
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,530
So that's basically it for this project.

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,300
See you guys in the next one.
