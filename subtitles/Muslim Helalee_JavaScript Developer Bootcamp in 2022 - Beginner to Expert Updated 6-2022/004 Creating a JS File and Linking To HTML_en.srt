00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:07,930
Hi, everyone, welcome to your very first hands on JavaScript lecture.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:16,129
All right, so in this lecture, we are going to go over how we can create a JavaScript file and how

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:25,520
we can connect it to a map now as this course requires an intermediate knowledge of HTML and Cyesis.

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,980
You guys know how you can link Cyesis file to an e-mail file?

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,790
Well, linking JavaScript is sort of the same.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,160
All right.

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,700
So first things first.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,620
We need a folder.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,920
And this is this folder is called Chapter two Resource Files, because this is the second chapter.

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,910
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to write click and I'm going to

11
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,260
say open with code.

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,800
All right.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,000
And here is our chapter to resource files.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,800
Let's go ahead and let's close the welcome page.

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,220
All right.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,130
So in here, what I'm going to do is, first off, we are going to create an HTML file.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,060
OK, so I'm going to just go ahead and I'm going to name it for Dasch.

18
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,560
Index dot e-mail.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,580
All right, and OK, so this is our e-mail file, I'm going to create a simple boilerplate and I'm going

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,850
to name it to creating a JS file, creating a JS.

21
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,730
So for sure, I'm just going to call JavaScript.

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,920
Sometimes I'm going to call it genius, right.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,490
JS file and linking.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,760
Linking to mouth.

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:50,040
All right, so now we have created our e-mail file, so how can we create a JavaScript file while creating

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,490
a JavaScript file is almost the same as creating an e-mail file except for the extension.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,750
So we are going to click on this icon that says new file.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,440
And we are going to insert first the name of the file, which is for Dash, let's say out now the name

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,240
of any JavaScript file.

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,750
Well, it is highly arbitrary.

31
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,240
You can choose to name it anything that you want, but the common convention of naming a JavaScript

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,490
file is either a machine or is either main or app.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,490
Usually developers, they call it app and the extension name is just JS.

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,250
And you guys can see that it says JS in yellow as well here.

35
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,860
So this is an empty JavaScript file.

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,960
So how can we link the JavaScript file to an e-mail?

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,420
Now, when we were when we wanted to link is Cyesis file, we went ahead and we went into the head section

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,060
of our estimate document and there we inserted a link tag.

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,460
Right.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,470
But JavaScript is actually inserted at the end of this at the end of the body element, OK?

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,140
And it is a script element.

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,580
So script is for JavaScript.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:06,940
All right.

44
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,720
So this is actually a JavaScript.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,050
Whatever you write inside this, this is JavaScript.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,750
And I'm just going to go ahead and create a comment here.

47
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,130
And this is called Internal JS.

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,670
All right.

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,190
So whatever you write in here is will be internal.

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,670
Yes.

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:33,390
We also have facetiousness, a style element and whatever we write inside here will be our internal

52
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,890
Cyesis styling.

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,060
We also have internal JavaScript logic as well.

54
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,570
Right.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,160
So whatever we write here is going to be our internal.

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,720
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to give you a demo.

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,520
But first off, I'm going to create an element and I'm going to I'm going to just go ahead and create

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,110
a button.

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,410
All right.

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,210
A create a button.

61
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,770
And I'm going to just name it button.

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,970
Right.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,630
And now let's go ahead and let's open it with live server, here is our page.

64
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,940
I'm just going to bring it here.

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,480
All right.

66
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,550
So this is the name of the file Extremophile, and this is our button.

67
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:13,970
All right.

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,670
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to make it smaller and I'm going to make this ed smaller as

69
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,060
well.

70
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,860
And I just want to put them side by side, all right, because I don't want them to take, like, a

71
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,930
lot of space so we can work and see our results at the same time.

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,370
So there we go.

73
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,930
So we have a button element and this is our button.

74
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,290
All right.

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm just going to zoom in and 300 percent.

76
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,180
Now, how does internal JavaScript work now?

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,290
We haven't officially started studying the language yet, but what I'm going to do is I'm just going

78
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:55,850
to go ahead and I'm going to make this very, very simple and low level website, make it dynamic.

79
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,340
So when we click this button, what I want to do is I want to change the background color of the body

80
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,950
whenever I click the button.

81
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,300
So what I'm going to do is, first off, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to grab the button.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,670
All right.

83
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,080
So I'm going to name the button B10 and JavaScript.

84
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:13,820
All right.

85
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:22,190
So let's go ahead and let's grab it the same way in in that whenever we want to style an e-mail element,

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,410
first we have to selected.

87
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,650
That idea works in JavaScript as well.

88
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,370
When whenever you want to apply functionality on any element, you have to selected first.

89
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,210
All right.

90
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,950
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab our button and I'm going to say an event listener,

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,300
we are going to listen for a click, because when I click, I want I want the background colors to change.

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,780
And when the click happens, I want to run a function.

93
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,640
The function is going to grab the document.

94
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,230
So we want to change the background color of the body.

95
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,530
Right.

96
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,590
So for grabbing body in JavaScript, we just say document that body.

97
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,400
And now we want to tap into the CSX world.

98
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,010
Whenever you want to tap into the sea, this world inside JavaScript is just red dot style.

99
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,500
OK.

100
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,570
And from there, I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to say back ground color.

101
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,470
Right.

102
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,380
I think I have misspelled document document.

103
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:35,510
All right, so it is background color, and let's put it to, I don't know, like olive olive drab.

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,450
Let's save it.

105
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,520
So now if I go ahead and if I click on this button, the background color should change, which it doesn't

106
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,010
because there is another typo here as well.

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,260
Now, let's go ahead and click it.

108
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,260
And now you can see that the background color has changed to olive drab.

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,900
We can go ahead and we can inspect that as well.

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,900
So if I come here, it says, so let's grab the body.

111
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,070
And it says olive drab right here.

112
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,460
Right.

113
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,090
So this is internal JavaScript.

114
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,460
All right.

115
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,860
We also we can also link an external file.

116
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,960
OK, and that is interestingly the same script.

117
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,820
OK, we just write a script and we give this script a source.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,770
Now, where is the JavaScript file?

119
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,120
As you guys can see that the JavaScript file and the EMR file there on the same level.

120
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:33,870
So if I go ahead and if I just write the name of the file, we should be able to grab it.

121
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,790
Here it is.

122
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,820
So now I'm not going to go ahead and I'm going to write another code of JavaScript.

123
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,270
I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to paste it here and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to

124
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,590
save it.

125
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,640
Now, this code is commented out.

126
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,140
It doesn't work anymore.

127
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,620
But if I click on it, the code comes from here.

128
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,190
Right?

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,980
So this is how you can link a JavaScript file to an e-mail file.

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,750
Now, you might ask, OK, which which way is better now if the same thing, the same idea as with Cyesis,

131
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:13,730
if you have very few lines of styling or you have very few lines of code, then you should use an internal

132
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,210
script.

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:22,220
But if you have a lot of lines of code and a lot of like logic, it is best to create another JavaScript

134
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,650
file.

135
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,150
Right.

136
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,580
But in any case, you know, it's a best practice.

137
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,580
You just write your code to separate.

138
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,669
It is called a separation of concerns in programming, and it means that you separate all of your files,

139
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,890
OK, your case file is separated, your e-mail file separated, and your JavaScript file is separated

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,679
now at the end of this video.

141
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:50,630
I just want to introduce you to another very, very important idea in JavaScript, and that is the developer

142
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,390
console.

143
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,620
Now, you guys can see that this is actually our.

144
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,100
This is the developer tools in here, all right.

145
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:08,530
And the developer tools is used to inspect any Web page or to debug our code.

146
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
All right, so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to increase the size of this window and we are

147
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,260
going to reset this to 100 percent.

148
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:22,960
Now, we are used to working in the elements tab where we have our HDMI markup on one side and we have

149
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,970
a series of styles on the other side.

150
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,390
We also have our computer styles well with all of the browser implemented styles.

151
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,830
But what about JavaScript?

152
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,700
Where does JavaScript come inside this browser tools and that JavaScript comes inside the console.

153
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,040
Now, the primary function of the console is not to create applications or right.

154
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,120
When whenever we create applications, we want our applications to work within that, within the donc,

155
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,320
within the e-mail document.

156
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,670
All right.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,080
But console is used to test our code.

158
00:09:59,470 --> 00:09:59,850
All right.

159
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,190
So we are going to work a ton inside the console.

160
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,480
But for now, I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to give it give you a demo of how console works.

161
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:08,830
All right.

162
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,620
Because as soon as these are the beginner chapters, we are going to work a lot, a lot with the console.

163
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:23,770
But as we move on and once we get to the advanced chapters, we are going to work with the console less

164
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,700
and less until maybe we had a bug or something.

165
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,290
Right.

166
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,990
So so in order to top the console, we just write console that lock.

167
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,830
Now, that console is actually this console right here, OK, on the right in the browser.

168
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,200
Right.

169
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,590
So this is the console.

170
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,700
Now we want to print something in the console.

171
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,490
We want the console to show them something.

172
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,720
So for that, we said log.

173
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,120
All right.

174
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,800
Now, log is a console method.

175
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,440
All right.

176
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:02,350
Now, keep in mind, there are some codes which are reserved for JavaScript, but there are some browser

177
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,000
logic as well.

178
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,790
Console log is a browser code.

179
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,330
It is not decent.

180
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,080
This code is not actually a JavaScript code.

181
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,550
The syntax.

182
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,590
Well, actually, it it resembles JavaScript.

183
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,950
But this line of code, it is not JavaScript code.

184
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,420
It is the browser code.

185
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,130
Right.

186
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,660
So inside the log, what do we want to say?

187
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:31,720
I just want to say hello, world, a very overused and generic line.

188
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,230
All right.

189
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,960
Hello world.

190
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,230
Let's save it.

191
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,230
And now whenever I click on this button, we should be able to see the world down in the console.

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,600
There we go.

193
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,920
It says Hello World, and it even gives you where the hello world comes from.

194
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:55,960
So if I were to click on this for Dash Abdah, just line five, we are going to go to our line and this

195
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,300
code resembles our code in our code editor.

196
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,530
So this is the good thing about console.

197
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:09,370
I know a number of sources and about these tabs inside our developer tools and that's why we use them

198
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,170
in here.

199
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,030
You guys can see we have our no errors, no warnings.

200
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,540
So we if we have any errors or warnings, we are going to get them here as well.

201
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,450
So this is a very good thing to be used, especially for beginners.

202
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,060
And we are going to use console a lot because we want to play around with JavaScript code and we want

203
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,500
to test it so we can understand it.

204
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,030
That's it for this lecture.

205
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,180
See you guys in the next one.
