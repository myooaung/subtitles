00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,719
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,300
In this lecture, working to create the length assessment function.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,220
All right, so we know that all of our assessment functions are going to be housed within this calculate

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:22,890
pass for strength function, so let's create that first and the calculator Strache password strength

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,610
function is going to grab the password as a parameter because here we have an argument.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,549
This argument requires a parameter.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,340
So in here, first things first, I'm going to.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:45,290
I'm going to declare that assessments are right, that we have that we have all right, and then we

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,330
are going to push to that array.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,600
We are going to push to that area.

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,610
Certain criteria, certain assessments.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,200
So first off, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say assessment.

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,280
Right.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,610
And I'm going to initialize it as an empty array.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:08,600
And then we are going to push the length lower case, our upper case number and repeat character assessments.

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,960
Very simple, right.

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:17,000
So let's grab the assessment and we are going to say dot pusch and what what are we going to push to

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,490
get?

19
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:25,580
First things first, we are going to push the a length assessment function and it is going to have a

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,030
and an argument of password.

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,960
So now let's come down here and you know, before going down, I just want to say a return assessment.

22
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,110
Return assessments.

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,880
So if I come down here, let's go ahead and let's create that length function so length assessment function

24
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,940
are going to pass and the password as a parameter.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,550
All right.

26
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,890
So now what do we want to do inside this length function?

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,990
All right, length assessment.

28
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:05,500
We want to assess if the password has there are going to be two, three criteria, actually, if it

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,430
has five or less than that characters, if the characters are 10 or less or the characters are more

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,930
than 10.

31
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,620
All right.

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,800
So in these cases, we are we want to print different messages here.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,570
So first off, let's go ahead and let's grab the length of our password and let's save it inside the

34
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,350
password at length.

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,830
I'm going to go ahead.

36
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,540
I'm going to cancel log this length.

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,920
So we are on the same page.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,320
So if I put it Q W you can see that we get two now because there is nothing here.

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,540
You can see that it is 100 if I do.

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,620
One, two, three.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,280
Now you can see there are five.

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,170
So the length is going to be five.

43
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,000
So where is this value coming from.

44
00:02:51,010 --> 00:03:00,340
It is coming from the because we have arguments which, for which the values, the arguments, values

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,540
they come from.

46
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,280
Sorry, we have parameters, the values for the parameters they come from the arguments, password input.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,170
That value is this value.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,220
And when we say password input that value and then we say that length is going to give us the length.

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:27,100
So this password is actually if I were to say password input, dot value, then it should work in the

50
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,610
same way.

51
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,730
So if I type anything, you can see we have we have something here.

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,550
So there are eight.

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,630
So if I write let's clear this.

54
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,210
If I write one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

55
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,310
So the final one is going to be nine.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,440
So we have the length is going to be nine.

57
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,500
Let's go back.

58
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,750
So now that you understand where this is coming from.

59
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:58,610
Let's implement our control flow and we are going to say if length is equal to or was less than or equal

60
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,370
to five, what do we want to do?

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
We want to return an object.

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
What is the object going to do?

63
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,630
The object is going to have a PWI check.

64
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,990
We have already created that.

65
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,760
Where is the PWI check?

66
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,760
OK, pass password, yeah, right here.

67
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:27,240
So now we can see that this assessment, it can have this assessment isn't is an array and the array

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,890
has multiple objects inside of it.

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,190
So when you say DOT passwords, check, it is going to grab the this from inside, this from inside

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,280
this assessment array.

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,400
So what do we want to do with the passwords.

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,990
Check should say password is too short.

73
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,090
All right.

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,190
So this is going to say a password is too short.

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,640
We need a strength lost as well because we had for the assessment we had two properties.

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,380
One is strength lost and the other one is password check.

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,200
So I'm going to grab the strength lost and I'm going to define it right here.

78
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,040
And what is the strength that we are going to reduce it by?

79
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,480
It is going to be 40.

80
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:17,030
So if the password has characters less than five, we are going to reduce it by 40 percent.

81
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,280
So if I type one, you can see that the password strength is exactly 60 percent.

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,700
But when we go above that, we are going to go to 100 because we don't have any other criteria so far.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,190
So this is the first if statement that we have here.

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:41,870
The second one is going to say, if the length is less than or equal to 10, this is still not a good

85
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,370
idea to have equal to 10 characters or less than that.

86
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,020
A password should have more than 10 characters.

87
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,950
So for that, we are going to return another object, the past.

88
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:59,270
It is always going to be that this password check and strength lost because this is what we have provided

89
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,570
here.

90
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,480
So you can see here.

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,940
So what is what is the message going to say?

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,780
The message going to say password could be longer, could be longer.

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,420
And what is the strength that the user is going to lose?

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,610
The password is going to lose.

95
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,280
We are going to set it to 15 percent.

96
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:26,690
So if I were to say like one, two, three, four, because it's equal to or less than five, we get

97
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,270
the message that says password is too short.

98
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:37,130
Even if there are even if there are five, then it's still going to say password is too short.

99
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:45,470
And when we say this is the password, you can see that the length, just this strength, it increased

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,500
incremented, it was incremented by.

101
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,770
So it was 60 because 100 minus 40, we had 60.

102
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,720
And then now it is, um, why am I.

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,040
So now the password strength is less than 15 percent less.

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,200
15 percent than 100 percent.

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,730
Right.

106
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,530
So it is 75 percent.

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,310
It was increased by 15 by 25 percent.

108
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,880
So 40 minus 15, we get 25 percent.

109
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:23,490
But still you can see that we lose 15 percent because the strength lost is 15 percent.

110
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,680
And why do we lose it?

111
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,840
Because strength is 100, 100, minus 15.

112
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,630
This is what the sentence is going to do.

113
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,640
It is going to say 100 minus.

114
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,020
Minus 15.

115
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,540
What is this going to give us 85?

116
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,820
So 85 is going to be the value of the strength.

117
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,610
Very, very simple, right?

118
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,530
And we are add on keep this in mind.

119
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:56,940
When we say a positive sign, an equal sign or a negative sign and an equal sign, we add on to it.

120
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:05,310
So if there were only like a positive a negative sign here or an equal sign, then the next value would

121
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,860
have overwritten the current value.

122
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,020
We don't want to do that.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,210
We want to add on to it.

124
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,150
That's why we say plus plus we have done this multiple times in our previous applications.

125
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,660
But the difference is we have done plus we have never done negative.

126
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:26,960
So if we go more than that, you can see that we get the password.

127
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,190
It goes to 100 because we don't have any more criteria.

128
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,409
So let's reload this page.

129
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,799
The password starts from zero.

130
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,860
So now we have created our length assessment function.

131
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:48,390
What we are going to do, as in the next lecture, we are going to create our lower case and hopefully

132
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,100
some other functions as well.

133
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,480
So see you guys then.
