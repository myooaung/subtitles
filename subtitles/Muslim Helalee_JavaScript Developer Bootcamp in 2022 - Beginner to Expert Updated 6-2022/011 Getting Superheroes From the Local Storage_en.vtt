00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.700
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.340
In this lecture, we are going to get superheroes from local storage.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.560
All right, so this is going to be our third and final class and I'm going to call it store before getting

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.850
them, we need to store them.

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:24.110
So we are going to say store superheroes and this class is going to be is not going to be instantiated

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.740
because on the methods of this class, we are going to use the static keyword.

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.590
This is the page.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.450
You can go ahead and read all about it.

9
00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.990
Right.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.100
And the reason that we we are not going to instantiated like we did here is because the methods of this

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.710
store superhero, they are going to be interconnected.

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240
The interconnection requires multiple instantiations.

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.760
So in order to avoid multiple instantiations, we are just going to use static.

14
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.280
And so we avoid the use of multiple like saying same something new store superhero.

15
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.280
And that's like that's going to mess up our code.

16
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.960
So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to write static.

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.240
You just have to write static in front of the method.

18
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.850
And we're going to say get super hero now.

19
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.560
Now we are checking if the local story has superheroes inside of.

20
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.440
So we are going to initialize it, initialized superheroes, a variable called superheroes.

21
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.490
And now we are going to say if local storage dot get item, dot get item.

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.440
What is the item name.

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.060
The item name is superheroes.

24
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.300
If this item is null, do what if it is not?

25
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.070
And at the end of the day, in the local storage, we're going to have an array.

26
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.590
And inside that array we are going to have objects.

27
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.600
Right, be them adjacent or whatever.

28
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.890
So we are going to say superheroes.

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.940
Just return an empty array, and if there is something inside the local storage, get that, get it.

30
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.370
All right.

31
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.380
And forgetting from the local storage, we just say local stories that get item.

32
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:25.170
And the item name is going to be superheros, so just going to just go ahead and get that item now when

33
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.010
the local storage gets that item, JavaScript is not going to be able to read it.

34
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.560
So we need to pass it.

35
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.610
That's why we are going to say pass.

36
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.730
And this path pass is actually a Jason method and we are going to store the results inside superheros.

37
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.010
Right.

38
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.040
So we are going to store it inside this array that we have.

39
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.640
And at the end, we just want to return our superheros, superheros.

40
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.980
All right.

41
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.150
So now we have successfully created the get item.

42
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.310
We are going to get items.

43
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:10.060
I know at this time if we go to application to local storage, we do have this.

44
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.580
So where is this?

45
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.570
Oh, it is.

46
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.870
I think it is coming from when we created this.

47
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.280
It's not here.

48
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.740
So let's reload it.

49
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.540
And I think it's.

50
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.560
Project and.

51
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.780
Delete it, let's delete that from the local storage and now we don't have anything inside the local

52
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.290
storage.

53
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.110
I'm going to close this window and I'm going to close this one.

54
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.130
I'm going to leave this one open because we will be using that.

55
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500
So now we can see that the local storage is completely empty.

56
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.130
If I were to add this here, it is not being added inside the local storage.

57
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.000
The reason for that is we have not created the odd superhero method.

58
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.630
We are we are going to create the odd superhero method in the next lecture.

59
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.500
But in here, I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to call it here.

60
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.860
The reason that we are calling it here is I'm just going to explain it in a sec.

61
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.600
So we are going to say, I think superhero to local storage.

62
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.630
All right, because if the superhero name Universe and power are empty, we are going to show on air.

63
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.760
If they're not empty, it means that they have been completely filled out.

64
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.530
It means that there is some entry there.

65
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.100
We want to grab that entry and store it to the local storage.

66
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.490
What is the class that is dealing with local storage that is super store superhero and we are going

67
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.630
to add superhero and we are going to pass in our entry.

68
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.080
So our entry is going to have a superhero name.

69
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.180
This is the entry name Universe and Power, and then we are going to store it inside the local storage.

70
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.260
So that's it for this lecture.

71
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.880
See you guys in the next one.
