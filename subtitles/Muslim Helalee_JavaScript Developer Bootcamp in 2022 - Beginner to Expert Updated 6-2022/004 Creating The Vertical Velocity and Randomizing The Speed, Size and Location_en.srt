00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,740
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we are going to create the vertical velocity and randomize the size,

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,650
speed and location of our stars.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:23,240
All right, so if I come here insight into this page where it says Pythagoras's theorem and what Pythagoras's

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,510
theorem says is that if you have a right triangle, right angled triangle, it means that the angle

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,409
is going to has to be like 90 degrees.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,550
If you have this triangle and you have two sides of this available, you can find out the third side

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,030
using this formula.

8
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,550
So it says A squared plus B squared equals C square.

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:58,490
Now we have our speed, which think of it as C, we do half hour A sorry, B, which is the horizontal

10
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,270
velocity, but we don't have the A, which is the vertical velocity.

11
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,370
Now, if I were to rearrange this mathematical formula, we would.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,200
Now I want to find out the A..

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,820
So I would have to move B to the other side of the equality.

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,960
Now, the sign of B is by default is positive.

15
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:24,230
And if I if you move something to the other side of the equality when it is in and in the sort of addition

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,600
or subtraction formula, then the sign is going to change.

17
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,700
So if I move this B square to here, we will have C squared, minus B squared.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,050
So A squared is going to be equal to C squared, minus B square.

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,790
Now we do have these squares, right.

20
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:51,800
And if I take a root, a square root and added to this side of the equality and added to this side of

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,690
the equality, that this this power of two is going to cancel that square root.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,680
So we are going to end up with an A and that square root is going to stay here.

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,800
So basically what we end up with is going to be something like this.

24
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:19,460
So we have a equals, we have a square root in JavaScript, his language, and then we have C, which

25
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:28,410
is to the power of two minus B, which is to the power of two.

26
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:35,090
So basically we have this mathematical equation and now we have to convert this into the language the

27
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,820
JavaScript can understand.

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,730
So first off, I'm going to say I'm going to sell let vertical velocity.

29
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:52,270
And I'm going to say now we have a square root function in JavaScript and keep in mind that all these

30
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,130
mathematical formulas, they are.

31
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,180
They are like within this math object.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,320
All right, so and that the name of that is EQR t or returns the square root of a number.

33
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,480
So so the a part is this part right here.

34
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,900
Now, this square root that we have is going to be a security.

35
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,750
Square root, and then inside of that, we have C Square.

36
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,980
Now, keep in mind, C squared is our star speed that we have found out.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,070
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say now, how do you say something to the power of something

38
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,810
in JavaScript?

39
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,620
For that, we have yet another cool method, and that is Pough.

40
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,620
P o w so we are going to say math dot pough, and now keep in mind it returns to things.

41
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,750
It requires two things the base value of the expression, the exponent value of the expression.

42
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:57,250
So if I open this up, it is going to give us a more sensible explanation.

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,470
So it returns the value of a base of expression taken to a specified power.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,310
So we have no and we have no.

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:15,140
So the first one that you have to provide here is going to be that variable that you have and that variable

46
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,620
is no longer speed its stars speed.

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,980
Right.

48
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:26,360
And the second one is going to be the power of that room number, the exponent exponent value of the

49
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,010
expression.

50
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,730
So see to the power of two.

51
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,900
This is see to the power of two.

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,680
So this is how JavaScript handles powers.

53
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,660
Right.

54
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,970
And so we have completed that.

55
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,550
And after that, what do we have?

56
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,650
We have a negative side.

57
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,450
So I'm just going to go out of it and I'm going to provide negative side.

58
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,100
And then we have B to the power of two or horizontal velocity.

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,660
So we are going to say math dot pough.

60
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,450
It's not poor like the dog's paw.

61
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,560
No, it's po po W..

62
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,290
All right.

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,340
So for that, we are going to grab our horizontal velocity.

64
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,900
Horizontal velocity and what is then the power, the power is going to be to?

65
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,150
So basically, we have completed this now, this is always this, sometimes it is going to give us a

66
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,650
positive, sometimes it's going to give us a negative velocity.

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,990
All right.

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,620
But we want I'm just going to remove or I should I keep it here?

69
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,900
I'm just going to comment it out now.

70
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,880
What do we want?

71
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,800
We want to multiply as as with this one.

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,860
We want to multiply by multiply this by the random sign as well, because we want to find we want to

73
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,180
have a positive or a negative sign as well.

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,200
So either it's moving or if it is moving towards the top, it's negative.

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,640
If it is moving towards the bottom, it's positive.

76
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,040
So that's why we are going to add the random sign as well.

77
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,970
So that's it for our vertical velocity.

78
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:15,160
Now, underneath here, I'm just going to say randomizing the stars speed, size and location and we

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,840
have done this.

80
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,730
This is extremely simple.

81
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
We are going to say four, let I equal to zero.

82
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,760
So we want to.

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,850
Why is that?

84
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,390
Plus.

85
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,880
Plus.

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,920
So we are going to start from zero and then I is going to go all the way to less than stars.

87
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,340
Stars, what stars no.

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,700
And that is one thousand and then we are going to increment the eye by one each time.

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,750
So first off, we know that Stars is an empty array.

90
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,520
So all of these locations, speed and size, we want to push it to this.

91
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:01,140
So that's why I'm going to say stars I saw each time this for loop runs, the eye is going to have a

92
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,610
certain property.

93
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,270
And that property, the set of properties, which is actually an object, this object, each time the

94
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,600
eye runs, this object is going to be pushed to the stars, which is an empty array.

95
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,270
So what do we have?

96
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,070
What are the properties that we have here?

97
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,220
The first one I'm going to call Star Radius.

98
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,300
And so this is the radius of our star.

99
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,720
And of course, because we have different star sizes, we're going to have different radii.

100
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,100
Right.

101
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:39,870
So we are going to say math are random times the size that we have here, because this is a fraction

102
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,240
of that.

103
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:48,360
How do you know it's a fraction of the the screen that's a maximum star size as a fraction of the screen

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,680
with.

105
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,830
How do we know that?

106
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,070
Because we just multiplied by the canvassing board with.

107
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,540
That's how we know it.

108
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,310
Right.

109
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:03,240
And now we can leave it like this or we can even divided by two, because to get a smaller and even

110
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,260
smaller number.

111
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,040
Excuse me.

112
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,510
So if you don't divide it, you're going to get like a slightly bigger one.

113
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,360
But if you divide it, you're going to get a slightly slower, sort of slightly smaller number.

114
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,600
And then we want to have a horizontal position.

115
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,530
So we want to create a circle for a circle.

116
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,880
We want we need a horizontal position, vertical position, radius, start angle and angle.

117
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,710
All right.

118
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,640
So we have created the radius.

119
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,330
Now we need to create the horizontal and vertical positions.

120
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,340
So I'm going to call it horizontal position as opposed to horizontal velocity.

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,340
And what is the position?

122
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:47,430
So we are going to grab our math are random because we are we are randomizing the location or the position

123
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,870
as well.

124
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,780
So I'm going to multiply it by the canvas.

125
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,500
We have done this, that width, because this is vertical.

126
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,930
This is horizontal.

127
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,350
We are going to multiply it by canvas done with.

128
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,030
Now, keep in mind, the random is going to give us some decimal points to remove these those decimal

129
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,450
points.

130
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm going to wrap this inside a math dot floor function.

131
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,330
So my third floor is going to round it to the smallest, to the nearest integer like Florida.

132
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,960
So if it is one point one, it's going to be one.

133
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,330
If it is a one point four, it's even if even if it is one point four, it's going to be one.

134
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,180
Even if it is one point nine, it's going to be one.

135
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,850
That's how math that floor works.

136
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,730
We are going to have the same thing for the vertical position except with a difference.

137
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,740
And that is going to be canvas element tight.

138
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,280
So now we have created these properties here.

139
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,890
And what I'm going to do next is now we need to specify the velocity for these as well.

140
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:01,140
So the horizontal velocity, the horizontal velocity is going to be equal to the horizontal velocity

141
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,490
times, the speed, what I like to call boost what, not three those two to us.

142
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,330
What a speed boost.

143
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:18,500
So if I were if I come here now, you can see some of them the travel faster than the others.

144
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,300
That's why I'm going to multiply it by speed.

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,480
But we are yet to create it, so I'm just going to create it here.

146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,100
Speed boost.

147
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,580
So it's going to be random number.

148
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,070
And what is the speed boosts range?

149
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,410
So it depends how does it depend?

150
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,500
It depends on how fast do you want it to go.

151
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,500
So now for this animation, the speed boost is one point five plus point five.

152
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,550
So the maximum is going to be two.

153
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,660
So the speed boost is maximum two and minimum point five.

154
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,240
So if I can if I change it to like a maximum of five.

155
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,120
You can see how fast they go, right?

156
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:06,400
So this is a maximum of five and a minimum of point five, you can say a maximum of 100.

157
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,150
Then it's like like firing all the time, except for this guy.

158
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,550
This is the the difference, the different one than the others.

159
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,170
So some of them are faster.

160
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,240
Some of them are slower.

161
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,360
You can go 1000 and it's practically shooting.

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,040
Right.

163
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,760
You can go 10000.

164
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,740
And now you can see that my computer is not working properly.

165
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,070
So it depends on what you want.

166
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,890
I want it to be the maximum, should be two and the minimum should be like this.

167
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,250
So I think this is better or maybe like the maximum should be three minimum should be point five.

168
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,310
So we are going to say at times, so I'm going to say the maximum should be three, the minimum should

169
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,080
be point five.

170
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,140
So whenever it gives us one, this matter random gives us one one multiplied by 2.5, we are going to

171
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,610
get two point five plus point five.

172
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,740
We are going to get three.

173
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,410
So the maximum is going to be three.

174
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:12,380
But when this matter random gives a zero zero times 2.5, we are going to get zero zero plus point five.

175
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,650
We are going to get point five.

176
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,190
So the minimum is going to be point five are right here, right.

177
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:30,090
OK, not that comma, and we are going to do the same thing for the vertical velocity ver vertical vertical

178
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,430
velocity that I spell it correctly.

179
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,380
Perfect, perfect.

180
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,900
Now, we are basically done with this as well.

181
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,390
We have come a long way.

182
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,430
We still we can't see anything here.

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,530
The reason for that is we have not drawn anything to the canvas.

184
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,870
So now what we are going to do is in the next lecture, we are actually drawing something to the canvas.

185
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,310
So far we were basically involved with the logic of this effect and from the next lecture onwards,

186
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,940
we will be printing them to the screen.

187
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,360
So see you guys then.
