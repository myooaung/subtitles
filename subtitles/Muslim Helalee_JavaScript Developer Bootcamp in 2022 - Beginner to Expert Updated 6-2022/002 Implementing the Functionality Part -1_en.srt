00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,830
Hi, everyone, in this lecture, we're going to implement the functionality of the temperature converter

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,620
application.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,020
All right.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,480
So first off, before jumping into code, we need to know what we want to do.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:25,640
So whenever I click inside any of these inputs and I start typing something, I can see that in the

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,390
both of the other inputs we can see something we can see in.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,310
No, OK.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,530
Of course, that number is based on a formula which we are going to insert.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,870
But this that number or those numbers, they are being inputted dynamically.

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,880
They are being input dynamically.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,300
All right.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:54,650
So what we need to do is we need to grab all three of these four elements and then we need to apply

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:02,060
an event listener on all three of them, because whenever I type inside one of them, all the rest of

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,780
the two, they also change values.

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,420
So I'm going to come inside my app that just file.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,500
So first stuff.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,210
What I'm going to do is I'm going to grab all three of the inputs individually because we want to change

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,880
their values depending on the formula that we insert.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,280
And then I'm going to grab all the inputs together and the event is going to be on that.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:28,990
Right.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,800
So I'm going to say Celsius.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,540
Celsius.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,110
Input.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,910
All right, so it is document that query selector, we're going to select it using our query selector

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,460
method and it is an input type.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,870
All right.

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,780
So it is an input.

28
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,420
And what is the idea?

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,440
ID is Celsius.

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,830
So each of the inputs, they have their own specific ideas so they can be recognized.

31
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,730
Right.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,990
So what I'm going to do is let's select the Farenheit as well.

33
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,070
So it is.

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,710
Um hmm.

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:13,000
So like this Celsius Farenheit they spell correctly Farenheit.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,140
It's a tough one.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,730
I thought the other one was being edited as well.

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,390
So let's grab the Celsius control the Ferrin.

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,220
Hide.

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,190
All right, so and the last one is the simplest, which is Calvin.

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,230
All right, so now we have selected all of the input feels individually.

42
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,980
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select them collectively as well.

43
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,810
So I'm going to call them temperature inputs.

44
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,980
All right.

45
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,540
Notice the other ones.

46
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,240
They are just input, but this one is inputs.

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,800
And we're going to say document, query, selector.

48
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,800
But this time we are going to say queries, after all, because we are selecting more than one element

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,540
and we are going to select them by their element, which is input.

50
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,400
So now let's grab the temperature inputs and we are going to say add event listener.

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,790
So we are going to loop over them and then we are going to say out of a listener.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,840
So let's do a for each loop and the loop variable is going to be input.

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:29,240
Now we are going to grab that input and each time the user writes inside one of those inputs, we want

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,950
to do something.

55
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,780
So the event because we are working with inputs, is going to be input.

56
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,840
And what about the callback function?

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,780
The callback function is going to be an anonymous function with the event as the parameter.

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,870
Right, because we want to grab the value of that specific event.

59
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,230
Right.

60
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:55,340
So before going forward, I just want to consider log a few things because I want to show you how actually

61
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,440
this application works behind behind the scenes.

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,200
So first off, I want to consult either target value.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,670
Why now?

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,450
We know what the target gives us.

65
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,810
So what about the value?

66
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:16,760
The value is going to give us the target value for that specific object that has Sara for that specific

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,740
event on that specific input, which has been which has been received.

68
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,750
All right.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,590
So let's put it on the side and this is better.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,980
And so if I go ahead and if I click here and if I type 15, we can see that we get one and then we get

71
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,570
15.

72
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,720
And why is that?

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,520
Because on each time we change an input inside the input field, this event is going to is going to

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,200
be fired.

75
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:44,940
Right.

76
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,410
So the event is not going to wait until we are done with our input and then the event should start working.

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Now, with each input, the event starts working.

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,050
And this is the good thing, because in our final application, when I say one, we can see Farenheit

79
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,280
and Kalvin for one.

80
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,700
When I say two, we can see for that three.

81
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,470
So each time we can see that all these they are being changed dynamically.

82
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,660
So that's the good thing about this application.

83
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,370
All right.

84
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,710
So we have successfully selected the input values for any of the events.

85
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,080
It doesn't matter what that is.

86
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,140
So even if I come there and come to Kelvyn, we are going to grab it.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,740
OK, so it doesn't really matter where we are.

88
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,340
We have successfully selected that either target that value.

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:43,160
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grant I'm going to grab this and I want to store the value inside

90
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,470
a variable and I'm going to call it that.

91
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,500
And I'm going to say temperature value.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,490
Right.

93
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:57,050
So whichever number that the user, whatever it is that the user inserts inside those inputs, it is

94
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,800
going to be our temperature value and we have stored it inside this variable.

95
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,210
Right.

96
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:11,210
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do one more console lock here and I'm going to say type of temperature

97
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,750
value.

98
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,910
So let's go ahead and check out what the type of the temperature that value is.

99
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,110
So we know we have a type of operator.

100
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,140
So if I type in 15 or if I just go ahead and if I had one, we can see it says I can just go ahead and

101
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,880
do it one more time to reload the page.

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,310
So if I say five, we can see it gives us a string.

103
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,950
We don't need a string because these are no inputs.

104
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,360
We want to grab a number.

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,620
We want to have a number.

106
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,130
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to you know what?

107
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,520
I'm going to delete this, cancel log, delete this one as well.

108
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,510
And we know that temperature value is not a number.

109
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,880
It is this variable.

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
This is not a number.

111
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,190
This is a string.

112
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,620
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this.

113
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,610
And on this, I'm going to call not Jason.

114
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:13,010
I'm going to say pass, pass integer because pass integer method, it converts a string into a number.

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:23,190
And now if you go ahead and if we say concer log typeof temperature value, we are going to get a number.

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,900
So if I click, we can see we get a number.

117
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:26,960
All right.

118
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,400
So we just did this and most of the heavy lifting is done.

119
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,760
Now I'm going to create another variable here.

120
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:42,830
I'm going to call it inpart name, because depending on the input name, we are going to implement a

121
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,400
different formula.

122
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,080
So we need to know what is the input that the user has clicked in?

123
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:58,040
What is the input that the user is inserting the values when we grab it, then according to that, we

124
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,700
are going to implement a formula for the other two.

125
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,180
So if the user is riding inside the Celsius, we know that the user is writing inside the Celsius.

126
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,850
So we need a Celsius to Fahrenheit formula and in Celsius to Kalvin formula.

127
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm going to give you one more example.

128
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:23,780
So if the user is writing inside the Fahrenheit, we need a Fahrenheit to Celsius formula and a Fahrenheit

129
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,090
to Kalvin formula.

130
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,560
So we are going to implement an IF statement that we are going to do in our next lecture.

131
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,820
See you guys then.
