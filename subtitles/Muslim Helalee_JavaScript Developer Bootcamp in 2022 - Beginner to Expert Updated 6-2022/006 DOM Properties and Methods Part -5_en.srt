00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,720
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,170
In this lecture, we are going to take a look at another way of creating e-mail aliments.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,590
All right, so we have talked about how we can create any stimulus and how we can give it some identity,

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:22,510
some text or content on how we can make sure that a another element adopts this element.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,260
Right.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,070
A parent element adopts or appends it to itself or.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,270
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm not going to comment anything out.

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to pasted down here.

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,510
And now this is called method number six that we are going to talk about.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,430
And this is insert before.

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,960
And you might ask, why do I have to know about another method that does this?

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,740
Whenever you use the Appen child, OK, it is always going to append it to the end of that list.

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,400
What if you wanted you wanted appended to the top or what if you want to pin that child to like to be

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,550
the second item to third, to be the third or the fourth one?

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,300
So that control comes with the insert before method, right.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead through the creation of another element step by step,

17
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,330
and we are going to name it new item two, because I want you guys to have a bit more practice.

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,210
So we are going to say new item now.

19
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,580
We have created a new item.

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,970
I'm just going to call this, too, and we are going to go ahead and we are going to say document that

21
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,310
create element and what is the element that we want to create?

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,710
It is an ally, right.

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,750
So after the element is created, what I want to do is I should be able to grab the URL, the parent

24
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,420
and the item before which I want to insert this newly created item.

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,690
So where do I want to insert it?

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,030
So I'm going to come on top of it and I'm going to say const like, let's go.

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,500
Let's say we want to insert another item before this first item and I'm going to name this first item.

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,630
Let's selected document that query selector.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,810
And here we are going to say you now take a look at this.

30
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,460
We have three allies here, right?

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,790
All three of them have a class of item.

32
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:35,070
How can we select the best and easiest selection is just to grab them by their Biasutto pseudo class.

33
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:42,350
And we are going to say Elai first, Dasch child, this is our first child, Suda class selecter.

34
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,540
Now we have selected this loyal and we can check it out as well.

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,260
So I'm just going to go ahead and just very quickly for demonstration purposes, I'm going to log it

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,700
to the council first item and when I hover over it, we are going to see that the first item is highlighted.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,700
This is one of the best use cases of console's of luck, right.

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,640
So now that we have selected our first item, the item that we want to inserted before, all right,

39
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,950
and we have selected our you have there as well, so we don't need to select a reviewer once more.

40
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,740
All right.

41
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,910
And we have created over Elia's.

42
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,600
Well, now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give this illi some some identity.

43
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,180
I'm going to give it some content or text.

44
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,450
But before that, let's go ahead and let's consulate.

45
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,400
Let's log it to the council.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,410
I was about to say consoli to the log.

47
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,150
New item, and we are going to see this is empty.

48
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:49,250
There is nothing inside of it and we are going to say new item to that, enter the text should be protective.

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,050
Save it, and now it has got some identity, but still we cannot see it here.

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,870
It should be should come before the loyal one.

51
00:03:59,290 --> 00:03:59,680
All right.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,840
Now for the third and the final step, well, actually, we had three steps I forgot to mention.

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,920
Now I'm mentioning it.

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,630
It is this was step.

55
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,290
This was second step, the creation of the element.

56
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,130
The first step was the selection of the element.

57
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,550
The first step is the selection of the element before which you wanted you wanted to insert.

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,880
The second step is a creation of the element and the third step is actually appending this.

59
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,130
All right.

60
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,660
So we are going to say list DOT.

61
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,430
We have the other has a variable name of list.

62
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,570
So we have successfully access that there.

63
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,430
So we don't need to really do it again.

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,880
And we are going to say that insert before.

65
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:57,540
All right, we are going to grab our item, what is the item that we want to we want we want to we want

66
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,270
to insert what is that item?

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,530
It is the new item to and where do we want to insert it before before the first item.

68
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,780
When I say that, we are going to see that protective is right here.

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,140
So even though in the e-mail we have only three allies in the what page we have five because the two

70
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,310
of them are fed by JavaScript.

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,260
All right.

72
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,370
And I'm going to call this the third step.

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,330
Very, very simple stuff.

74
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:24,600
Right.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,060
So this is the end of this letter.

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,940
See you guys in the next lecture.
